B00627V4UU while filming this season- 911 happened. I was stunned at what happened to danny Sorenson. I wanted to see more of his character. after losing simone-this was too sudden. new characters emerged and were good too and the flow continued. still made me want to see more."
B00627V4UU I love NYPD Blue because it's so well written, has such great talent, and it is not overwhelmed with sex scenes.  Yes it contains some, but it's not all the time.  The stories are about people on the street and the everyday happenings of a cop shop.  Simply one of the best shows of its kind out there."
B0063BGBO4 Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
B0063BGBO4 Something is seriously wrong with the first half, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it is- it's incredibly boring due to being plotless.  It's about a group of middle aged party animals that reunite for a weekend (or week) of heavy fun, drugs and drinking but... for over an hour, that's *all* they do.  This might be fun for them but certainly not for us, the viewers.  They drink and do all kinds of drugs, they roll down hills, they drive fast cars, they simply party without taking a break while reminiscing about old times and past girlfriends.However the second half... wow, now *that's* what I call an improvement!  A drastically different turn of events, in fact.  When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are- storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when classic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one."
B0063BGBO4 I MELT WITH YOU is a disturbing film - in the psychological/ psychosocial sense - but perhaps the most disturbing aspect of it is the fact that the title it is based on a song lyric, suggesting that the story may indeed be more universal than we imagine. To read the lyric is imperative to understanding the film: `(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ (Let's stop the world) I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the/ Time / (Let's stop the world) There's nothing you and I won't do/ (Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ The future's open wide'When four 40-something college friends - Richard (Thomas Jane), Ron (Jeremy Piven), Jonathan (Rob Lowe), and Tim (Christian McKay) - meet up for their annual reunion, things start to spiral out of control, and a suicide pact they made as young men is revisited. A loud, and rather repulsive weekend of hardcore partying with drugs, alcohol, and sex - a binge in the beautiful Big Sur area - leads them to recognize that now they're all middle aged and not really happy about the directions their lives have taken. The fact that in their younger they made a pact while under the influence of drugs that if they were unhappy as middle-aged men, they'd kill themselves a pact they signed in blood. One of the men - Tim - is gay and is the most distraught and his decision to carry out the pact drives the remainder of the story to its end.This sad but conceivable story was written by Glenn Porter who with director Mark Pellington wrote the screenplay.  The dialogue borders on inane at times but the theme of the film is riveting. It is a disturbing story that only grows in the degree of wastefulness of lives in retrospect. Grady Harp, September 12"
B0063BGBO4 Firstly, let me tell you this film is about four friends and a week they spend together. They're all 44 years of age and the characters are varied. One is a self respecting artist/writer who says the artist should not be cynical, then you have a doc who is estranged from his family and his ex wife is remarried and he is suffering from helplessness blues, then you have an interesting sad happy homosexual man and lastly a regular guy with competitive genes. Four of them are trying their best to run away from their miseries during this get away and there is always some awesome music playing in the background. The music is an easy 10. The cast is mostly people you've seen on HBO (Entourage, West Wing, Hung..) The storyline is unique and I felt a constant surge of energy. If I could change something about the film, I'd add a few more sensitive dialogs without making it seem a little pushed. The editing could have been a little more \"free\" and that would have set it free. I can picture this film not doing too well and tanking completely but it had a few unique situations and conversations but towards the end like it's characters it ends up drugged and hungover which is why I really liked it, I guess. It was honest in that sense but a little more intelligence and... Anyway, thank you film-makers for the wonderful sound track, I have discovered some 10 good songs and varied artists. It is a good portray of the human condition and a dialog by Sasha Grey is quite possibly the best scene in the film. WATCH IT!"
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's I MELT WITH YOU is less a traditional narrative film and something more experimental; something more akin to a visual performance piece and not necessarily so much about the plot or dialogue. However, that's not to say that dialogue or plot don't exist. They're there and they're strong, and as far as performance is concerned, this ensemble is pretty impressive.Richard the writer (the always excellent Thomas Jane), Ron the financier (the terrific Jeremy Piven), Jonathan the doctor (The mostly under-appreciated Rob Lowe) and Timothy the question mark(the completely unknown Christian McKay) are four old college friends now all at 44 years of age who made a pact to meet up every year for a Spring Break getaway from family and work and all the pleasures/stresses those cause and have a week together in their own private Land-Of-Do-As-You-Please. Multiple glasses of alcohol are ingested. A smorgasbord of drugs are swallowed, snorted, inhaled and injected, partially as a gift from Jonathan the doctor. Richard brings some human party favors in young nubile female and male company (included is former adult star turned serious actress Sasha Grey). 80's Music is played constantly and loudly. They laugh as they reminisce and there is the sensation of freedom from the reality of their current lives, but it's exceedingly short-lived. Richard is a former writer-turned-teacher and serial womanizer; Ron is happily married with a great family but his financial shortcuts are catching up to him; Jonathan is wholly disillusioned with his profession and has reduced to selling fake painkiller prescriptions as well as being a divorcee with a young son who calls his step-father \"daddy\" now; Timothy is still grieving over the loss of his boyfriend 5 years prior.This week will be very different than the 22 that preceded it, though, and it will not end well for any of them.Things start out amicably enough, but as the week progresses, the group spirals out of control and a descent into what some might consider drug-addled madness but is actually something deeper and more meaningful for the four of them. Things become even more tense when the local town sheriff (the very talented and lovely Carla Gugino) begins to suspect there are darker things going on at the house these men have rented for the week.Mark Pellington, best-known for the dour domestic terrorism thriller ARLINGTON ROAD, goes back to his roots as a music-video director (where he is best known for the unforgettable video for Pearl Jam's haunting \"Jeremy\")as peppered generously throughout the film are brief flashes of the past, present and future, and meditative shots of the water, sand and rocks that surround their rented house in Monterey which is more evocative of Terrence Malick's work. It's an odd mix of smash-cut editing and longer and more visually arresting takes, and it's as disorienting as the constant haze of drugs and alcohol our characters are in.This film does suffer at times from what have come to be referred to around the internet as \"First World Problems\"; which is essentially a bunch of good-looking white men sit around a campfire and complain about their sex lives, their lack of wealth, and how unsatisfying their future is from how they were as kids. That was a big problem for me with Lisa Chodolenko's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but these problems become alternately more and less significant as the film reaches its second act where a drastic, desperate and tragic act leads these men to re-evaluate their problems against the vow they made to one another all those years ago. The whole rest of the film hinges on the importance of this vow, but the vow remains non-specific (but implied) until the very end.Aside from Pellington's expert use of the visual style in this film, the performances from the leads are range from very solid to downright awesome. Jane is absolutely mesmerizing in this film, as is Piven. Their characters really have the heavy lifting to do from a dramatic standpoint and they carry the emotional core of the film effortlessly. Both McKay and Lowe do very solid work here, but sadly their characters feel somewhat short-changed with the prominence of Jane and Piven. Gugino unfortunately has little to do, but is utterly convincing when she's doing it. The various supporting characters, such as Tom Bower playing an ancient mariner and the aforementioned Grey playing a somewhat spiritual and redemptive madonna/whore type have even less to do, other than spout some wisdom or forgiveness.It's definitely not a film not for everyone. While having a linear narrative, it still may be somewhat troublesome for a more literal-minded viewer. Personally, while being a somewhat upsetting and nihilistic film (something Jane seems to do very well: see THE MIST), it's also a very powerful and beautiful film about bonds that stretch across the years and the promises we make to our friends. The symbolism can get a little too heavy-handed and ham-fisted occasionally, but the rest of the film makes up for that.Also, killer soundtrack."
B0063BGBO4 The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.  The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking.  With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
B0063BGBO4 There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like \"I Melt With You.\" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes \"I Melt With You\" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a \"good\" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of \"real\" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of \"I Melt With You,\" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12."
B0063BGBO4 This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
B0063BGBO4 This film is actually a lot better than I expected. Five college grads reunite at a beachhouse getaway for the weekend, when things go horribly wrong from depression and a plethora of drugs to add to the mix."
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug-filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures. Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment."
B0063ONN9C My daughter keeps asking to watch season 1 again even though we have season 2....not sure what that's about. The writing seems as vapid as usual to me. Whatever...."
B0063ONN9C I used to hate this show, but I guess it finally grew on me. My daughter is obsessed with it so I guess after a while I started to see the appeal. The songs are cute, the characters are cute too. The colors are bright and the animation is great. I like that the characters look different (they aren't all little white kids) and that there are boy mermaids! How darling! Also, Mr. Grouper is a teacher. Usually on tv teachers are portrayed as women and men are portrayed as wanting nothing (wholesome) to do with children. In the &#34;time for lunch&#34; segment at least one of the kids (usually Oona for some reason) has a healthy lunch item like a veggie burger or carrot sticks. I always think it's positive to show children enjoying healthy snacks, even if they are cartoon mermaid children.My daughter loves Nonni and Deema. Nonni is precious and his deadpan humor is in stark contrast to the antics of the other characters. Deema is a little diva (I think we all know a little girl like this) and my daughter loves her hair. She loves to draw swirls and say it's Deema's hair.Her favorite episode is the one with the witch (voiced by Wanda Sykes) who wants to turn everyone into frogs. The songs and story are very creative. I thought it was sweet how they made the Big Bad Wolf a total sweetheart and the Giant a softie.To be honest, I don't think it's very educational. I know it makes attempts at education but I really don't think it comes across. I don't mind letting my daughter have a bit of shallow entertainment in small doses, since she is advanced for her age. But for kids and parents there are more educational shows."
B0063ONN9C Our 14 month old absolutely loves it!!! Hums the theme song all day long!"
B0063ONN9C The songs are catchy and the characters and stories are super cute.  We are totally on the guppy train in this house :)"
B0063ONN9C I do really like it. It was very, very good because teach little lessons, dance and sing and just have fun.  It's a show that makes me laugh!"
B0063ONN9C My child loves this show.  It's great to watch them interact and learn.  I totally recommend it for any pre-schoolers"
B0063ONN9C My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this series.  So happy to see it is available on Amazon, now she can watch whenever she likes."
B0063ONN9C Wonderful, family entertainment.  This program is both educational and delightful!  I love watching it with my son."
B0063ONN9C My toddler says bubba ga (bubble guppies) within 10 feet of seeing a tv. He loves all of the singing, Its educational so why not, 3rd season here we come"
B0063ONN9C Cute show.  My kids love it, especially my 21-month-old daughter.  She asks for it by name frequently!"
B0063ONN9C My 2 year old son loves this show! I am so glad he is able to watch it through amazon prime on my kindle! Cute, educational and fun!"
B0063ONN9C This is a fun show. My 2 year old granddaughter loves it. She has learned things from it and loves to &#34;sing&#34; and dance with the guppies."
B0063ONN9C My granddaughter loves Bubble Guppies, and watches them as often as possible!  She is 4 years old.  It's colorful, has a catchy tune, and good story lines."
B0063ONN9C My preschooler loves the Bubble Guppies!  It's colorful.  The stories are great.  But, best of all the music is top notch.  There are some children's shows that can drive you insane with the music, but Bubbly Guppies will have even adults singing along.  We're so glad this is on Amazon Prime now."
B0063ONN9C Kiddo adores this show. She love, love, loves the music and asks to watch the songs again and again. She even tries to copy the dancing! She's also learned a ton from the show. All those Mr. Grouper let's think about its she has memorized the answers and not just repeats them, but understands them. She even memorized the songs down to who dances/sings in the background on each one. It's like a kid magnet! If I play this when we're traveling random children drift over to us in the airport to look over her shoulder! Usually when we're at home I let her watch one show a day after lunch/before nap and it's usually this, Umizoomi, or a Go, Diego, Go (she's animal obsessed). Hope she continues to love it because she &#34;discovered&#34; this around the same time as Sesame Street and she's very over sesame. This keeps going strong!"
B0064JGWZS This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it."
B0064JGWZS AMC is still making the best shows on TV, and this one is near the top.  It takes a while to develop the characters, but if you stick it out then the wait is well worth it."
B0064JGWZS Finally the technical problems are resolved!SPOILERS:Chaos reigns in Hell on Wheels. Just desserts are delivered to the Swede. Rewards and loses come to others. While Bohannan's guilt and rage lead him to go too far."
B0064JGWZS I have watched many westerns with my Dad and this is one of the best! It tells about the beginning of the railroad and how the people have lived besides the main story about a Civil War Veteran that is looking for revenge toward the men that killed his wife and son. I can not wait for Season 3 to start on Aug. 10th!!"
B0064JGWZS You know, I've got my Dad to thank for getting me into Westerns. Starting out with the likes of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, going onto John Wayne and onto shows like The Lone Ranger-The Rifleman and then onto Gunsmoke-Wild Wild West and the like. I'vw watched them pretty much all my life and enjoy them very much. Heck, a time or two- I've even picked novels by Louis Lamour-Robert B. McNeill-Zane Grey and others and read them. I guess a part of me wishes I existed during them days so I could roam the plains and see the beautiful splendor of the outdoors. Anyhow, because of my love for Westerns, I happen to be talking to a friend one day about viewing Streets of Loredo recently. I told him how I enjoyed it but couldn't find any new Westerns out there that I hadn't already seen at some point(I am 45 years old, mind you). He recommended Hell On Wheels. The only thing he really told me about it was that it took place after the Civil War and that it involved the building of the transcontinental railroad. I was somewhat reluctant on getting it. Then, one day, my better half and I were renting a movie from Redbox when I'd seen the first five episodes available on DVD...so, I gave it a shot.It goes alot deeper than my friends' initial description of the show. It centers on a Confederate soldier who's out to exact revenge on the Union soldiers who murdered his wife. He ends up following their trail to the traveling town of, you guessed it, Hell On Wheels.The First Season does have its' moments but, for the most part, is a hard-hitting Western series that fans of Deadwood and the like will love.  If you'll notice, reviewers(inlcluding me) keep bringing up Deadwood. The reason is the show is well-written, the characters grow on you and it always keeps you coming back."
B0064JGWZS Interesting idea.  There are a lot of positives -- modern take on a western, shows some of the US expansion following the Civil War.  Good start."
B0064JGWZS I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show."
B0064JGWZS I love the show as I said in the title and I'll say it again it is just great. I think the appeal for me is I like the character of Mr. Bohannan (Anson Mount) he really is the whole show and his character development has been great. I might even have a slight man crush on him I can't quite tell. I mean the show was not without its flaws but I don't agree with some of the directions some of the characters have taken (head shot) but still a great show and I'm excited for season 2.So to somebody who likes westerns likes cowboys and Indians and things like that this is a great series with high production value, great acting and amazing sets. They really set the stage for the time and you never feel a break from that period of time.Oh and one last thing I just love Mr. Bohannan's voice as you can tell from the title hopefully you read \"Yeah that seems about right\" in his voice because one of his lines from one of the shows and that's how I say it and I LOL every time.Enjoy the show as I know you will."
B0064JGWZS When I first heard about \"Hell on Wheels,\" I really thought it might be yet another unforgettable series. Instead, this is entertainment PLUS, all the way through Season One, that will have you waiting for the next Season, too (or is that, Two?)!Anson Mount is simply terrific as Cullen Bohannan and Colm Meaney is always a pleasure to watch! Great to see Monk's Ted Levine in a totally different role (though he doesn't make it through all of Season One!) and finally, a word of warning: the violence can get REALLY violent!I loved \"Deadwood\", but Hell on Wheels has made me forget all about it!"
B0064JGWZS I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda. Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain. Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing--but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad (along with Poles, Italians, Swedes and Germans) with arrogant &#34;in-your-face&#34; Farrakhan blacks. The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned. I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula &#34;White/Black/Female&#34; second season."
B0064JGWZS I have read all the reviews here at Amazon about Hell On Wheels.  Most people get all defensive and say it's just \"deadwood light\" or something along those lines.  Admittedly, I have never seen Deadwood, so I don't know if these two are similar or not.  What I can tell you is this; I've read the show summary for Deadwood and I've watched Hell On Wheels.  Just from what I've read about Deadwood, it's nothing like Hell On Wheels as far as show plot.  Deadwood is mostly about general western reenactment and everyday life in what the real wild west would've been like.  Although I am sure there are alot of similarities in how the shows look and feel, Hell On Wheels differs in alot of ways.  Hell On Wheels is a modern day western show about building a railroad in the west, which sets it apart from Deadwood.  I've not read anything remotely close to that in the reviews for Deadwood.  In fact, the only real influence from Deadwood that makes it onto Hell On Wheels is some vague character similarities.With all of that being said, I'm not even gonna mention Deadwood at length anymore.  I'm not interested in that show.  I am, however, a big fan of Hell On Wheels.  It's a unique concept that has great plots and well-defined characters that makes this show compelling television.  From Cullen Bohannon to Thomas Durante to Robert Bell and his wife[forgetting her name] to Ferguson[Common's character].  All of these individuals make for intriguing on-screen dynamics with multiple implications and story plots that make you truly appreciate the effort AMC gave this show.  It's something that definetely stands out in AMC's television show lineup and something any casual western lover would enjoy.  And unlike old school westerns, Hell On Wheels has a consistent pace with a great story that does not drag on or dance around the point.  It's simple, straightforward storytelling that speaks for itself and goes directly at the audience.  Also unlike normal western television Hell On Wheels is not too dark.  It has elements of realism in its portrayal and is dark but not so much so that it looks gloomy[as Deadwood seems just by initial appearance].  Hell On Wheels has humorous moments while also remaining true to how a real western railroad work crew camp would look & feel like.  Just watching the bonus features on how they made the look of the show proves how much effort the show creators took into recreating authenticity.  To me, Hell On Wheels is a unique show that may take elements from past shows or westerns, but also stands on its own as completely different entity to itself.  It's not \"deadwood light\" or anything else in my opinion.  It is Hell On Wheels, a great show that deserves to be on television for awhile if the show keeps a consistency to it and doesn't overdo it or overexaggerate.  I could see this show lasting for at least 5 seasons or better if done right."
B0064JGWZS Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!"
B0064JGWZS I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen."
B0064JGWZS My wife and I recently had the delight of taking a guided tour through the streets of Tombstone, Arizona.  We're both history nuts, and our guide - a retired doctor who's gone about researching the peoples and places of the famed city for his own purposes - peppered his 2 and  hour presentation with modern pop culture references in order to help bring the days of the Wild West back to life.  In terms of authenticity at depicting the struggles of daily life for common folks, he rated two television programs very high.  The first - we guessed right - was DEADWOOD; the second was a bit of a welcome surprise: AMC TV's HELL ON WHEELS.HELL ON WHEELS appeared on AMC's schedule with relatively little pomp and circumstance ... at least, little by comparison to their competing programs MAD MEN and THE WALKING DEAD, which were given red carpet treatment.  The small, comfy Western's first season came and went with little critical acclaim, though it currently garners a respectable score of 63 on Metacritic's tracking poll.  Starring a practically unheard of Anson Mount in the lead, along with strong character actor Colm Meaney in a sizable secondary role, HELL ON WHEELS is `the story' of the old West, of pioneering a frontier and making it hospitable for the men, women, and children coming to populate it, all with a healthy bit of gunslinging vengeance thrown in for good measure.Cullen Bohannen (played by Mount) harbors a mystery: he's on a personal vendetta to find and kill the men who raped and murdered his wife while he was away fighting the Civil War.  In order to `fit in' inconspicuously amongst with the unruly types populating the expanding Western frontier, he takes a job as a crew chief for Thomas Durant (Meaney), rail baron.  However, Durant's sheriff - `The Swede' (Christopher Heyerdahl) - suspects Bohannen is secretly up to no good, and he goes forever out of his way to keep the man under his thumb.  The track will be laid, blood will be spilled, and vengeance will be had ... but at what costs to the players involved?What's particularly fascinating about the program is that - strictly from a character dynamic - Bohannen never knows who to trust, and this keeps the audience on the edge of its seat.  He's an effective boss, but he's constantly on his guard against others wanting the `top job' and willing to weasel it out of him.  Durant clearly suspects Bohannen's motives, but he's beholden to him at the same time for getting the tracks laid.  Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) - a widower with strong ties to the train business - wants to trust the man, but she's drawn into her own affairs to set right the legacy of her late husband.  To its strengths, WHEELS becomes a kinda/sorta Western noir as the roles of `ally' and `adversary' always seem to be in flux for our main character.Also, the expansion of the frontier - the building of the railroad - serves as a metaphor for all the stories here.  No gains are made without great personal effort and sacrifice.  With each new stretch of track comes another turn into unsuspected treachery - be it financial, spiritual, or even territorial as the local Indian tribes seek to stop the `black beast' rampaging over their land.  But, in order to grow, something must be torn away first - or be crushed under the locomotive's mighty steam-driven wheels - and the frontier promises to always extract its price.Bohannen's primary storyline - vengeance - comes and goes throughout the course of the first season; it plays strongly into the pilot episode, as well as significantly in the season finale, but along the way he's allowed to grow a bit and come to grips with the consequences of his actions.  Where it'll all go is a mystery as the season ends on a bit of a dramatic upheaval (no spoilers, just a massive set-up that might change the stakes for all involved) ... but I'll definitely be on board once the train heads out again for the next season.If there is any weakness to the stories here, it's the prevalence of interracial relationships.  For some reason, it seems as if the writers were intent upon putting everyone through the ropes so far as `race matters' was concerned.  Granted, you've got your `whites,' your `blacks,' and your `native Americans' all thrown together at a time when the cultural melting pot was boiling on the stove, but I'd rather the program dial back the blossoming romances every-which-way and continue to tell great stories of exploration.  Bohannen's search for justice has enough teeth to carry the main narrative for a respectable amount of time; layering on secondary romance after romance only dilutes the tales into yet another `spin' on race relations that, so far, carries the same moral of the story: \"try to get along regardless of color, folks.\"  Plus, there's plenty of gibes made at the expense of the Irish.  Seriously, by the end of the season, I was hoping that the writers played out the race card so that it appears only sparingly in the episodes yet to come.  It grew tired real quick.Mount, in particular, does an impressive turn as the principle gunslinger here.  For a talent whose rarely been seen on the big and small screen, he brings a wit and a charm to his grizzled stare, and the West comes alive with the crack of his pistol.  He's an everyman plunged into an antihero's journey - a jaded past and a jaded future - every bit as mean and lean as the circumstances require of him.  Meaney feels a bit miscast, at times, but, as the season progresses, his character thankfully gets fleshed out a bit more.  The true grit here, though, goes to Heyerdahl's Swede; he chews scenery every time he's on the screen - a great foil to Mount's main thrust - and it'll be a pleasure to watch where this ticket takes him.HELL ON WHEELS is produced by a partnership of AMC with Entertainment One Television, Nomatic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is handled through Entertainment One.  The disc is solid with exceptional video and audio production qualities; it looks and sounds terrific.  Music is used to terrific effect throughout the first season, at times sparse and, other times, haunting.  There's a great array of special features, including several `making of' shorts and character bios as well as some additional focus providing key insight into the narrative of several episodes.  If you're looking forward to season two, then you'd do well to bone up on these in order to better grasp where the show may be headed when it comes back to the small screen.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Fans of HBO's late foray into the contemporary Western DEADWOOD would do well to discover HELL ON WHEELS' charm; it isn't as obviously vulgar or gritty, but it captures the mystique of that certain time and place of the days long ago with equal emphasis on delivering a quality show with exceptional (if not minimalist) production qualities.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Foundry Communications provided me with a DVD screener of HELL ON WHEELS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B0064JGWZS I truly enjoyed watching this series- it has so much going for it. The setting is the backbone of \"Hell on Wheels\", and it convincingly brings this strange community (a camp of laborers at the western frontier, where the Union Pacific Railroad is being expanded upon and slowly extending its reach across the United States) to life. I could feel the filth and desperation of this world, as well as the aching backs and blistered hands of the men who were worked to the bone by their merciless \"walking bosses\".Equally strong are the actors who were cast to bring the characters of \"Hell on Wheels\" to life. The two protagonists, Mr. Bohanan and Mr. Ferguson, are absolutely fantastic. Though deeply flawed, I could not help but find myself rooting for them... even though they were oftentimes at odds with each other, making for a somewhat muddled viewing experience. But that is by no means a complaint. This is the result of brilliant writing (and acting), and all who were involved in the process deserve to be commended for their efforts.The only thing holding this first season back from five stars is some tired cliches (the wild eyed preacher, the angry Irishman, etc.), as well as some absurdly gratuitous violence that I feel was included simply because that's the trendy thing to do on cable TV nowadays. I have no problem whatsoever with violence in media, and I thought much of it was well placed in \"Hell on Wheels\". Confrontations between Native Americans and railroad workers made sense, as did the constant disputes among laborers. But do we really need to see things like the well dressed railroad tycoon mutilating bodies in order to make for compelling newspaper photos? The answer is no, my friends. That's in there simply to get a rise out of the viewers. Ugh. Such a boring, tired concept.But by no means should you let these minor criticisms prevent you from watching this series, particularly if you're a fan of period pieces, the HBO series \"Deadwood\" (from which influence was clearly drawn), or American history. This is fantastic television- no question about it. Can't wait for season two."
B0064JGWZS The series deals with the post Civil War expansion westward through the eyes of a former Confederate soldier who lost his wife and only child to Union soldiers.  Bohannon, our hero, joins the railroad crew as he finds a clue to the death of his wife.  Working with the railroad is secondary to his own justice and revenge.Season One is tawdry, dirty, and often horrid in the showing of the wretched life and conditions these men, and many women, were subjected.  Alliances, both easy and uneasy, are born and die as quickly as they are needed or no longer useful.Hell On Wheels has a feel of grittiness from beginning to end.  Some may find this a little too overpowering for their senses. Others will enjoy the series for not sugar coating the ugliness of the times."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing."
B0064JGWZS Is it original? Yeah. Is it poorly done? Yes, definitely. Very bad show. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The actors are just there for a paycheck. If you're a dullard, you'll think this is a great show. If you've seen better, forget it."
B0064JGWZS Historical value. I've actually sent history students home to watch this one. Even the weapons are well thought out for this series."
B0064JGWZS As much as Cullen Bohannon's adventures are interesting, and Colm Meaney's character is compelling, and Tom Noonan is just... wacko, sadly the show doesn't work as well as it should.The show, as another reviewer here pointed out, is DEADWOOD Light. It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did (mysterious and violent yet forthright man; naive yet beautiful recent widow; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area; unconventional and troubled preacher), but that's nothing revolutionary to a Western. These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling, but obviously, that needs to be dressed up a little more: The Black and Irish workers, the side-businesses in the camp, the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward. Again, sadly, it's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton (who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic, the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock (much like FASTER) and the performances, with a few exceptions, don't flesh them out further. I really wanted to like this show, too, since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now. I DVR'd every episode and watched the first four, but everytime I thought about watching a new episode, I just felt like it was a chore, and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV. Oh, well."
B0064JGWZS I can not say enough great things about this series. Well written, and the actors are wonderful. I have been searching for a great western type series to watch..and Shazam, here it is. This is a must see!!"
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it."
B0064JGWZS By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSI'm usually a fan of shows or movies which have a basis in history. Hell On Wheels fits that mold.Producers Joe and Tony Gayton got the idea from seeing a documentary.\"We [Joe and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that's great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. ,\" Tony said.The lead character Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is on a mission. The ex-confederate soldier is out to revenge his wife and son, who were killed by Union soldiers. He knows Union soldiers are working with the transcontinental railroad, to protect the venture from outlaws and Indians. He gets a job from Thomas \"Doc\" Durant to supervise an all-black \"cut crew.\"He meets and eventually becomes friends with Common (Elam Ferguson), a recently freed slave, who is trying to figure out what to do with his freedom.Another important character is Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott). Her husband, a surveyor was killed by Indians and she barely escaped. Her husband was partners with Doc, and he had maps which showed the course the railroad must take through the mountains. Doc courts her, mainly concerned on the front end with getting those maps.Hell On Wheels  is a great series, full of potent images, memorable characters and a story line that's believeable and rememberable. It was renewed for a second season."
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels is a Great series, good story lines, love the chemistry of the cast. I will be getting season 2."
B0064JGWZS This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting."
B0064JGWZS I very much enjoyed this fast-paced, semi-historical western series. Super exciting and full of suspense. The part I liked the most is that it wasn't like the HBO series \"Deadwood\" that throws out an F-Bomb every minute or two (literally). Sure there is some spicy talk, but it's not overdone in my opinion. There are elements (like the \"Soiled Doves\") that are just saucy enough without being disgusting. I think the blood and gore are a bit much, but every action-film is getting to be like that. Note to Hollywood filmmakers: Not everyone wants to actually SEE a man's head being blown off! We are intelligent enough to get what is happening without seeing a ton of blood and gore. So, anyway, other than a few moments where I had to close my eyes during the action scenes, I was riveted to the screen. Definitely give this series a chance. (Also, the 1st season is better than the 2nd...just FYI)."
B0064JGWZS With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as \"Mad Men\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival \"Hell on Wheels.\" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend \"Hell on Wheels\" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that \"Hell on Wheels\" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love \"Hell on Wheels.\" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas. Not fully cooked and sometimes relies on too many cliches, but it has enormous potential. And it sure does look great! KGHarris, 5/12."
B0064JGWZS This series is about the contradictions in our national history as we re recovered from the civil war,aftermath of slavery, Indian wars, personal trauma, growing industrialization. The story lines are absorbing and the acting is generally very good with particular praise for Anson Mount as Bohannon, Thor Heyerdahl as Swede, and Ted Levine as Johnson.  Levine plays a railroad overseer who turns out to have played a crucial role in the hero's traumatic past. He is outstanding in the role. I don't want to say more so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the series.If you enjoy historical sagas like Deadwood, Hatfield and McCoys you will enjoy this absorbing drama."
B0064JGWZS A colleague recommended I check out this series and I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story - very different from what is on TV right now.  I will order the second season as well and try to catch the third season when it's on TV.  This was reasonably priced and a great way to be introduced to the series."
B0064JGWZS I stumbled on this series and was blown away. It is the best!  Love everything about it. Acting and casting is first rate. I love Ian Tracy and he is perfect The story is clever..  I can't wait for season 2 starting aug 12, 2012.  The scenery is gorgeous. The star is a hunk too. Can't say enough positive things about Hell on Wheels.  A wonderful example of when film is good it can be really really good!"
B0064JGWZS I wasn't expecting the solid greatness this fantastically written, directed and acted TV series gave me. Most TV westerns of recent years have been a mixed bag. Mostly short series, not ongoing like this one.AMC has really got a winner on their hands here. And thus far season 2 is just as great. If you like your characters deep, and your western action exciting, then Hell on Wheels will fill your bill."
B0064JGWZS This could have been good..it could have been great. But, in order to please blood-thirsty audiences, I assume, too many scenes were sensationalized with blood, violence, and gore and a huge turn-off."
B0064JGWZS This wasn't my favorite show, but my husband sure did like it.  If you are into watching something different, then this is a safe bet."
B0064JGWZS I loved this series on AMC! I preorder this as soon as it became available. It does suck one of my friends that played a Native American on the show had to get killed put it is what it is. If you haven't seen it.. do! It's really great! Highly recommend!"
B0064JGWZS This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now."
B0064JGWZS There are some things to like in this show and some things to definitely dislike. But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances. On that note this premiere was the second most popular of AMC shows to date bringing in 4.4 million viewers. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: BVISUAL FEAST SCENERY POTENTIAL: B to B plus; GETS THE PERIOD RIGHT (for TV viewers): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011."
B0064JGWZS I really enjoy gritty westerns, epecially any with Clint Eastwood, so I like many were amazed with HBO's three season run of Deadwood. Hell on Wheels is nearly as dirty and raw, minus the language and nudity, as that show, but a couple of episodes ran rather slow and at times some scenes were unbelievable. The acting is solid throughout and the main character (featured on the DVD cover) who happens to look like Daniel Day-Lewis is someone I've never heard of before, but does a solid job. Even rapper Common proves he has some acting ability in the sidekick role.Miss Deadwood? Check out the weaker but still entertaining Hell on Wheels."
B0064JGWZS American TV continues its run of quality series with this Western set in post Civil War America.  There is a sense of the familiar in the way the episodes are put together, using the editing and music stylistic choices that have worked well in other quality TV series, but satisfyingly there is also a sense of something new, in the setting and the characters.  The setting is a gritty - well no, lets make that muddy, settlement which houses the workers on the railroad, and moves from time to time to stay where the work is - hence the title.  Into this town of ex slaves, immigrants, criminals and whores, comes an ex-Confederate soldier, on the trail of Union soldiers who murdered his wife.  However the pleasure in the series isn't this slim character arc, but rather getting to know the range of characters who subvert the usual clich&eacute;d expectations in Western - yes, we get the hooker with a heart of gold - but her history is an unexpected one, and yes, we get the lone preacher trying to convert the wretched hive of scum and villainy - but his character is also not as we at first expect.  Even Colm Meaney's magnificent railroad baron is a treat, as he defies expectations and manipulates (and occasionally is manipulated) those around him.  The head of security is a fantastic creation - The Swede, and then there is Common, playing the ex slave, and Dominique McElligott as the Englishwoman who supplies the beauty against the range of beasts on display.  They're all well drawn and well acted characters, which makes this an eminently watchable series.I had the same view as others as I watched this, that it was good to have aDeadwood: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] substitute back on screen - but in fact it's kind of unfair to compare the two.  The settings are quite different, though both maximise the drama by using a very distinct geographically bounded area to set their scene.  They are both down and dirty and show humanity at more lows than highs, but I would suggest there is a hint more optimism here, even if we still have the violence and cursing and whoring.  I am not an expert on the period, but the railroad crews are an interesting point of view to peek into this period of history and convinces as to its authenticity thanks in large part to its utterly committed cast.  I for one am looking forward to the next series..."
B0064JGWZS I admit i wasnt blown away by first episode, but it certainly builds over the season into a great show."
B0064JGWZS Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  My wife doesn't usually go for Westerns but she thoroughly enjoed this production.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly."
B0064JGWZS I love this series and had to have the discs. I plan to watch this many times over. Go Hell on Wheels!"
B0064JGWZS Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book \"Nothing Like It in the World\", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly \"The Swede\" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!"
B0064JGWZS The reviews about poor historical accuracy caused me to hesitate to buy this series. Since I don't know that much about the exact history, any artistic license taken did not bother me. This show is great and the 3rd season is in my WishList."
B0064JGWZS Set Tivo to capture this show when it started and after first, set to get season pass. Interesting, well done, multiple complex character show with old West as backdrop. More than a Western. Some history that seems to ring true even if it actually isn't. Rough and tumble and bloody at times. I do like series and hope to catch all of season 2. Recommend."
B0064JGWZS I had not previously seen Hell on Wheels so ordered just Season 1 DVD'[s.  Loved it, and will probably obtain other Seasons."
B0064JGWZS Deadwood (2004-2005) was the last good &#34;authentic&#34; Western show......until now.  Hell On Wheels does an excellent (and authentic) job of re-creating the era (post-Civil War; dawn of the Transcontinental Railroad), while still mixing in enough drama, sex and intrigue to attract more than just history buffs.  All-in-all, an excellent first season; I just purchased season 2, so we'll see if the legacy continues."
B0064JGWZS Cullen Bohannan (Anson Mount) provides a most interesting protagonist in this realistic post Civil War drama/action series. Cullen is seeking revenge for the defilement and death of his wife during Sherman's destruction of Meridian, Mississippi. As Cullen gets his revenge, he comes to find out there is more to the story. He is unique in that he married a Northern woman, and freed his slaves prior to the Civil War and hired them to work his fields. He also claims no belief in God as he comes across as a second amendment atheist. Rapper Common did an excellent job as Elam.Cullen takes up with the railroad in the wild prairie land as Native American raids become one of many the dangers in this traveling road show known as \"Hell on Wheels\" which includes people who support the men such as prostitutes, preachers, and picture men.While the costume details and history appear authentic, there was one thing that caught my ear: The derogatory word for a Chinese worker (rhymes with clink). The first known use of the word was in 1890. The film starts in 1865. Appears to be some sloppy research.My main criticism of the series is that it moves at a slow soap opera pace.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the pilot. Things get a little spicier in the series."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or \"the old west\" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!"
B0064JGWZS In comparison with much of what is available in the way of westerns, this is a minimally acceptable series.  The plot is interesting, the actors moderately competent, and the set designs and photography convincing.  Obviously, this series is a milksop imitation of Deadwood.  Deadwood was a ten; Wheels is a five.  Unforgivably, the depictions of Native American culture are offensive.  Such caricatures would be expected in a 1940's John Wayne oater but are both atavistic and ridiculous in modern productions.Still, there is enough of interest in Wheels to warrant viewing (if nothing better is available and one is relatively desperate for escapism)."
B0064YPHEK Love the Nature series. Its educational, enlightening and entertaining. There are even some episodes I'm not sure i want to watch ...but they suck me in and i end up enjoying."
B0064YPHEK I liked the premise at the beginning of following the raccoons given collars, but then the focus shifted to other cities.  By the time it shifted back to the Toronto study there was not enough time to get much information.  I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the original study with perhaps just a few remarks about the Japanese and German ones."
B0064YPHEK Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature."
B0064YPHEK What a great series!  I will watch it again and again.  One photographer dug a four foot by four foot pit and lived in it for seven months to get a shot of Siberian tigers!  It's a great series."
B0064YPHEK The nature series is very entertaining while enlightening and does pass on a lot of knowledge. This series should be in curriculums in elementary school."
B0064YPHEK The doucmentary was good.  Interesting but not in great detail.  The poor video quality made it hard to watch.  Interesting about the Harpy Eagle, but I had to go to other websites to get more detailed information"
B0064YPHEK I love Nature but do not have cable TV or a local PBS station to watch so I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime but sadly not a lot of episodes.  Hope they add more at some point."
B0064YPHEK it is just great nature show...heads above those on animal planet and other channels similar such as discovery etc.  watch it"
B0064YPHEK The particular episode I watched about odd animal friends was so heartwarming and so different to see animals grow up together that would usually be enemies.sometimes it's like humans if you aren't yet taught to hate you don't know you aren't supposed to be friends."
B0064YPHEK I like this series. Each episode is interesting and some of them are downright fun! They're not controversial at all."
B0064YPMOU It's so hard to know what is really going on in wars, until we can look back with 20/20 vision at these documentaries.  This series gives a voice to the truth.  My parents said they had no real knowledge of the truth about the Viet Nam war while it raged on and on.I'm a nurse and for many years I've been thanking the few Nam war vets who have been in my care because I knew about the terrible home-coming they received and I truly admired and appreciated the service they gave our country..  As I held the hand of one vet and thanked him..he said: &#34;No one has ever said that to me before.&#34;  to which I replied: &#34;Well..they should have.&#34;Presidents Johnson and Nixon were two of the worst leaders and liars America had seen in it's president's up to that time.  We've had worse since then with the Bush administrations and now we have the worst leader in history with &#34;Puppet&#34; President Obama.In President Kennedy's own words in filmed speeches, he was set against sending troops to Viet Nam.  I believe that is partly why U.S. political forces failed to protect him and helped arrange to have him killed. Who is REALLY running this country and who is really putting these kinds of men into office?  Is it really the voters??"
B0064YPMOU I was still in High School when that war ended for the US but had some recollection of events both in the classroom and newspapers and broadcasts.  I also have an older brother who served two tours there.  This was an amazing piece of documentary work.  Both the visual content and narration was amazing.  I really can;t say enough about this series.  Watch it."
B0064YPMOU This was an excellent series and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this war and the struggles our Soldiers and country faced."
B0064YPMOU One of the best documentaries on the Vietnam War.  Extensive coverage, thoughtful interviews and good footage.  The editing was better than I expected.  Overall, outstanding."
B0064YPMOU I enjoyed watching the series. I enjoy Vietnam movies. I grew up watching the war on television and worrying that I would be drafted into the war. The war ended before I finished high school. Confusing time in America during the war with the protests against war, civil rights movements and riots. It was good to see the soldiers point of view from the private up to the general."
B0064YPMOU decent real footage and objective reporting. Welcome the insertion of facts and events that were not presented before, butexisted non-the-less."
B0064YPMOU *Added 21 January 2014: The latest reviews offer an interesting insight into this series. There are even more reviews than expected and they are less critical! During WWII the 'enemy' was obvious. Vietnam is more easily compared to Afghanistan.Original review date 14 September 2013:How to explain our involvement in Vietnam? How to explain our country divided? This is a beginning to try and help one understand the reality . . .  my generations's war. Photographs and video footage bring a reminder of what happened but cannot give back the lives lost. Familiar and yet different, an intimate view of what happened and what was to come. I found the narration to be well done even it didn't always match the footage. The nightmare scenarios followed one after another and the lessons were learned too late. Who they were, where they were from and what they did, create a video worth watching/listening.['Army Brat' . . . both daughter and wife]The wrenching reality of this series is by far superior to most Vietnam documentaries. The original review remains as written and I have chosen to append these comments after purchasing and viewing the entire series. My own knowledge came from those who served 'in country,' veteran sites and archives. For those who want a simplified comprehensive assessment, this series presents an overwhelming abundance of information for both the personal and political overview.  Thank you to all those who served our country and to those that made this documentary possible."
B0064YPMOU I felt this was the best Vietnam War documentary I've ever seen.  Not only is the war in Vietnam given a broad look, but also what was going on back in the states, and how our vets were treated."
B0064YPMOU A very good albeit short history of the Vietnam war.  Some not before seen footage.  Worth a watch."
B0064YPMOU Very well done. The film footage show a lot of what was happening and took me back to the way things were."
B0064YPMOU This  series should be required viewing for any politician that wants to get the US  into another war.  Very moving sequences and personal  experiences.  Some of the footage was shown repeatedly."
B0064YPMOU This is an older program that aired some time back.  It provides a good and accurate summary of the history and politics of the Vietnam war."
B0064YPMOU Well written and documented with very good images.  It took me back to 1969 very quickly and my time there."
B0064YPMOU I grew up during this war and remember watching some of the things mentioned during tv newscasts. I am not sure how exact it is historically but I feel like it was a good representation of the series of events that happened during this time period in American history"
B0064YPMOU Absolutely fantastic! Shows the real war as it was, not as it was portrayed to be by our government. If you are a war historian then you need to see this program!"
B0064YPMOU This is a greats series. It gives the viewers insights into the minds of the young men and women who served and fought in the Viet Nam war. I am a history buff and study a lot about this period in American history (my father served in Viet Nam in 1966)."
B0064YPSRG This is a quirky romantic comedy about a young man in New York City, who is a pickpocket. He meets a woman and has a passionate affair on a one night stand. She finds out she's pregnant and confronts him with choices and challenges he must make in order to continue the relationship. Very funny, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!"
B0064YPSRG First of all, don't pay any attention to any bad reviews, I seriously doubt these people actually watchedthis movie. For an independent, it was quite a surprise. Facinelli does a terrific job with the screenplay abouta pickpocket trying to pay off his Father's $500,000 debt to scumbag Vincent Gallo. Along the way, he manages tolift a badge from Michael Madsen, who works for acknowledged superfreak William Forsythe (in a very subdued role)and then all hell breaks loose.As our lead is being pursued by seemingly the entire NY City police force, his mom breaks bad with Joe Pantoliano,and he \"accidentally\" bumps into and falls in love with the beautiful, but recently impregnated, Jaimie Alexander,with whom he had a one night fling then apparently forgot about.The writing is tight, the characters are well cast, there is humor, drama, intrigue, and romance, and this is MichaelMadsen's best role since ... well since hell I cant remember... a long damn time.Anybody that doesn't like this movie needs their heads examined. For its budget, a solid 4.5 stars."
B0064YPSRG LOOSIES like so many other art house films that take a while to build an audience, but then enjoy a faithful following. But this film is a real find: Peter Facinelli is known to everyone as the head of the Cullen Clan in the vampire TWILIGHT series and as the goofy delusional doc on the NURSE JACKIE TV series (and from roles in a lot of small films where he didn't get the notice he deserved). But who could tell that this tall stud muffin natural comedian could also write? Facinelli came up with the story and wrote the screenplay for LOOSIES and he also stars as the main character - and he is a hands-down winner in each category. Director Michael Corrente seems to let Facinelli have the film and he plays it to the hilt while at the same time molding into a solid ensemble of fine actors.Bobby (Peter Facinelli) is a young pickpocket in New York City, snatching wallets, cellphones, briefcases and money as slick as any pro could perform. He lives with his mother Rita (Marianne Leone, wife of Chris Cooper!) and follows his life of petty crime to pay off his recently deceased father's gambling debt. All his work is turned over to Jax (Vincent Gallo), a filthy clod of a guy who berates Peter's inability to go big time in theft. Bobby is a fairly happy-go-lucky guy until he accidentally encounters Lucy (Jaimie Alexander), a beautiful girl who works in a bar but who Booby happened to have a memorable one-night stand with three months ago. Lucy confronts Bobby, Bobby doesn't remember her name, and when Lucy informs him that their little tryst created a pregnancy, Booby tries to do the right thing and find the money to give Lucy to 'take care of the pregnancy'. This leads to a serious of crazy events: Bobby needs big money, mistakenly lifts a police badge form a cop (Michael Madsen) whose boss (William Forsythe) threatens to fire him unless he can get his badge back. The 'cops and robbers' scene plays out: Lucy doesn't want to be associated with a pickpocket despite the fact there is a newly rediscovered chemistry with the changing Bobby, Bobby resents his mother's finding a boyfriend Carl (Joe Pantoliano) who owns a jewelry store, but plans a gig with Jax to work a deal with Carl to get the cops off his tail and allow him to become the guy he really wants to be.How Bobby makes his way through this complex plot is the magic of the fine writing and the first class acting by the surprisingly hunky Facinelli. Jaimie Alexander is a terrific find, and the cameo roles by Vincent Gallo, Marianne Leone, Joe Pantoliano et al are beautifully realized. 'Loosies', by the way, is the term for loose cigarettes that people can but without investing in a pack. Seeing the film, titled so appropriately, will make the audience sit up and pay attention to Peter Facinelli in a totally new realm of respect. He is VERY good! Grady Harp, April 12"
B0064YPSRG For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."
B0064YPSRG A hardly memorized movie of a not-so-bad looking guy avoiding sexual encounters while a story is about his choices as he was accused in making one pregnant during a one night stay.Not much at all."
B0064YPSRG Nice little romantic \"comedy\". One of those where things just go from bad to worse and one has to shake one's head. Liked both main characters and think they did decent acting jobs. Could be a data movie for 25 - 30's.  Recommend as entertainment."
B0064YPSRG I have to say that I am a huge fan of Peter Facinelli, having said that this movie could not have entertained me any more. He did a superb job with the part as did the rest of the cast."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a solid film.  It's about a group of young Scottish hikers programmed for adventure.  They're quite happy about their journey at first... until one guy from the group goes to take a leak and hears the faint sounds of a little girl crying for help.  They then realize the girl is underground so they dig and dig... and eventually find her.  However there's no time to celebrate I'm afraid, as it's quickly discovered that these hikers are being hunted by two crazy men with guns and a Russian accent (at least I think it's Russian).For the first half of the movie, these hikers are literally running and climbing rocks for their lives as the crazy gunmen continue to stand around, reload and fire at their targets, and hey, if they intended to wipe out the hikers backpacks, they succeeded with flying colors, har har!Anyway the hikers are now on a mission to protect the little girl that they freed and saved from the underground box she was forced to squeeze into, and after the first half with all that intense mountain climbing and careful maneuvering the storyline eventually rolls into town... not sure *which* town exactly, but the gameplan remains the same- protect the girl no matter what.  Unfortunately  now the gunmen are more aggressive than ever.You see apparently the little girl is valuable but I wasn't really sure in what way, and if her importance was explained I didn't catch it (and I even tried as hard as I could to understand the accent of the two gunmen but every so often a few hard to comprehend lines were thrown in there).There's some really graphic segments in this movie.  The one that surprises me the most is the one where two of the hikers were simply climbing down from a mountain and suddenly the guy standing on top of the rocks falls down the mountain to his death on a row of rocks beside a river.  It's an amazingly graphic scene and makes me sick when you realize how fragile life can be for a mountain climber- one wrong move and that's it, you're done.  The woman who was positioned halfway down the mountain turns around and sees her friend falling as it happens, and she lets out a terrifying and realistic scream that really bothers me.Overall, I really like this movie.  The Scottish accents are easy to understand, the woman most persistent on protecting the female child is really beautiful, the acting is fantastic, the action and suspense is constant, and it's just a wonderful movie."
B00669UD0Q This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All-in-all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster"
B00669UD0Q In the immortal words of Charlie Brown,\"Argh!\".  This film is terrific for its first two-thirds.  Director Julian Gilbey wratchets the tension in this portion immeasurably.  Gilbey seems to be taking his cues from John Boorman's \"Deliverance\" and Walter Hill's \"Southern Comfort\" in exploring the age old themes of man versus an unforgiving natural terrain combined with threats from his fellow man.  It's in the film's final third where things go terribly awry.  It's here where the film devolves into a second rate \"Taken\" that makes little narrative sense.  I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie.  If you must proceed there's a lot of good stuff but you have to divorce it from the dross."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and /or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure/suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy."
B00669UD0Q There have been some number of adventure thrillers where mountain climbing is at the heart. For my dollar this is well worth seeing.Here's the scoop. Five friends start out to climb a mountain. By pure chance they come across a young girl held in a makeshift underground vault. They realize she's been kidnapped for ransom and proceed to free her and make their way off the mountain, only to find her kidnappers are on their tail. Who will prevail in this game of cat and mouse?Given the mediocre reviews I almost didn't hit the play button on this. I was glad I did. It's better than I anticipated. It's directed and shot well. Great respect is shown for the mountains and landscapes. It gives the viewer a good sense of nature without looking like a travelogue. The pursuit is generally pretty good. There were a couple of cheap shots in the script. Face it. Playing the gun jamb card at a crucial part of the proceedings just doesn't cut it any more. But a lot of nifty things do happen elsewhere. Making the kidnapped girl an Eastern European, with the subsequent communication barrier causing more problems, was a nice touch. Things DID get a bit muddy for me when the guys with the ransom money enter the fray. I had a difficult time hearing what they were saying so I think I missed out on some important stuff.The acting by the climbers, particularly Melissa George, was pretty good. The bad guys didn't do much more than shoot their guns so it's hard to gauge their acting skills.This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's certainly better than 3. If you like action/adventure flicks you could do much worse."
B00669UD0Q Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere. Seemed like an afterthought finish. Great, and even good, movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools."
B00669UD0Q By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Gilbey brothers, Julian and Will, almost didn't get to see their vision of A Lonely Place To Die, come to fruition. During one of the numerous climbing sequences a boulder came crashing down, almost hitting the production team.The film which was filmed in the Scottish highlands focuses on five mountaineers, who get caught up in fight-to survive the elements and ruthless killers.The climbers rest at the top of the ridge when Alison (Melissa George) tells the rest of the gang to be quiet, that she hears something.Soon the group discover a vent pipe coming out from under the ground with a weak voice coming from beneath. They dig, uncovering a chamber with a young Serbian girl inside. She can't speak English and they can't speak Serbian but they slowly become aware that she has been hidden away as part of a kidnapping plot.Miles from civilization the hikers must decide what to do. Knowing the danger, some want to abandon the girl saying \"at least she's free from her containment.\" But conscience prevails and they concur they must become reluctant heroes. The girl has no experience climbing. The terrain is unforgiving so they split up with two going for help, while the other follow a longer but safer path to the nearest community.The kidnappers return, armed to the teeth and start the deadliest of hunts.This is a terrifying cat and mouse where the obstacles are steep, the prey unarmed and the odds astronomical.This is a sleeper, must-see thriller."
B00669UD0Q Good, solid, tough, very brutal and action packed thriller about a deadly encounter in Scottish Highlands...This is a very good albeit VERY brutal British thriller, with good actors and a strong scenario, all of which is placed amongst breathtakingly beautiful landscapes.Of all the actors, before watching this film I knew only Melissa George (i saw her in &#34;Triangle&#34;), but everybody plays well. My favourite characters were Jenny (Kate Magowan), the older of the two women, who left her daughter with grandparents to relax a couple of days in the mountains in company of her significantly older husband and then Ed (Ed Speelers), frequently wise-cracking and occasionally annoying slacker, who once had a Croatian girlfriend who used to scream at him a lot in Serbo-Croatian...)))About the scenario, without revealing anything else than what is said on the back cover of the DVD, I will just say that it begins with five friends, three men and two girls, hiking in the wilderness of Scottish Highlands. They are all good people and the introduction, even if it is short, manages pretty well to establish a connection between the viewers and the five heroes. The place they have chosen to hike is so remote, that there is no cell phones service or Internet available and even the GPS plays tricks...Then suddenly the five heroes discover someting in the middle of the forest... And once they discovered it, the film really begins, because now some other people simply CAN NOT let them leave the wilderness alive...I am absolutely not saying anything about what will happen next, but believe me, if you like action packed thrillers you REALLY want to see this film. The scenario is really solid and the tension is maintained to the end. The villains are extremely bad people, but unlike in so many American films they can also speak - and what they have to say is as interesting as it is shocking...The finale of this film is particularly good - and shocking. Frankly, at the very end I felt a very cold shiver on my back... The conclusion of the film could be that if you really want to steal a dragon's egg, you should first be CERTAIN that you can outfight, outrun or outsmart the wyrm... Because woe to you if you can not...Music is rather discreet but in the moments it appears, it is very skilfully chosen to fit the landscapes or the action. In the beginning and expecially in the end we can hear absolutely splendid traditional Scottish songs, one of them dating from Jacobite wars. I liked them greatlyA very important warining here - this film is extremely BRUTAL and minors should not watch it in any circumstances.Bottom line, this is a good, solid and very BRUTAL action thriller and I am very pleased that I watched it. Enjoy!"
B00669UD0Q A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is an intense action thriller buoyed by breathtaking climbing sequences and quick-paced action sequences.  Set in the gorgeous Scottish Highlands, the film follows five mature adults on a climbing vacation who stumble upon a little girl buried underground, obviously a victim of kidnapping.  Their decision to rescue the child propels them into a cat and mouse confrontation with the deadly and relentless kidnappers.What elevates this sharp indie is the characters are believable and empathic, even if we don't get a lot of background we do care about them and want them to come out on top.  Director Julian Gilbey expertly keeps the tension intact and elicits strong performances from his talented cast.Melissa George (TRIANGLE, BAG OF BONES) gives an outstanding committed performance as the feisty but sensitive Allison.  Ed Speelis is good as the roguish Ed who experiences a sudden and required maturity.  Sean Harris oozes chilli9ng venom as evil Mr. Kidd and Karel Roden quietly compelling as Darko, the negotiator.  Eammon Walker and Alec Newman round out the cast.  Holly Boyd is effective as the kidnapped child.A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is dark and an ultimate downer.  Its also an expertly filmed thriller worthy of more attention."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place to Die is a movie best seen knowing as little as possible about it so, if you've avoided learning about the plot so far, just watch the movie. It plays with expectations and conventions to appear to morph from genre to genre while actually staying true to its own story. It's an adventure tale that moves along briskly without dawdling where it shouldn't and without rushing, either. The few very, very slight missteps are only apparent in contrast to the assuredness of the rest of the film and they pass, quickly to be forgotten. The Scottish Highlands setting verges on beautiful familiarity but reveals strangely beautiful alienness as the film progresses. The action and stuntwork in the film remains at a human level and is all the more effective for it."
B00669UD0Q If you are looking for a movie to add to your movie night, try this one you will love it. I watch this on Netflix, thinking it may have been poor entertainment, I was wrong. Its  starts of with 5 hiker's in the mountains; when they hear the cry of what seem to be a young girl crying for help. Then everything spirals down hill from there, I won't spoil the movie you won't be disappointed. Although, I felt the ending could have been better ,but still a great movie."
B00669UD0Q It focuses on a group of people who hike into the mountains and find a young girl buried under the ground... alive... they dig her out and try to get her to safety... TRY is the key word... someone is hunting them."
B00669UD0Q This was a good popcorn thriller. Nothing more.The acting was good, story line had some holes but what film that we love doesn't?I can confidently recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure film but isn't looking too closely at the cosmetics.Should give it 4 stars but, meh, it will find its viewership.Worth it if you can find it under $10."
B00669UD0Q \"She's our responsibility now. We've got to get her off this mounting as soon as possible.\" When a group of mountain climbers out for a weekend of fun hear a sound in the forest they begin to investigate. When they find a little girl held prisoner in a small chamber they decide to rescue her. While trying to get her to freedom the hunters decide that a group is more fun to hunt then one little girl. This is a very frustrating movie to watch. The beginning was very tense and has you interested almost immediately. You feel like you can't catch your breath the entire time and are really rooting for the crew. Then with about a half hour left the movies stumbles badly and turns into something completely different and is barely able to hold your attention until the end. If I judged the movie based off the first hour I would definitely say watch this. Based off the ending I would say watch it still, but shut it off with a half hour left and have someone tell you the ending. Very disappointing. Overall, a very good movie for most of it. I give it a B- (would have been higher if ending was better.)"
B00669UD0Q Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic \"Deliverance,\" Julian Gilbey's movie \"A Lonely Place to Die\" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, \"A Lonely Place to Die\" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when \"villains\" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in \"A Lonely Place to Die.\""
B00669UD0Q The idea of taking someone and hiding them away until the ransom is collected is not new, and that is the main story here.  What is new, though, is the fact that they are hidden underground in a remote area in the mountains and found by mountain climbers/hikers.It does get very gory at times but you have to expect that from the contract killers/goons who took the young girl to begin with."
B0066SB8UQ You really can't go wrong with the Green Lantern Corps at all. Like to see this animated series do well and continue to evolve."
B0066SB8UQ keep the story  going  the rumor is your going to end the show after this season. that would be less than smart"
B0066SB8UQ If you have even a passing interest in the DC Universe or Green Lantern. You really must watch this show. From the beginning. You'll be so hooked. AND, you'll love it. On par or a bit better than Avenger's the Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Even better than the new Green Arrow adult show Arrow. Basically uses Geoff Johns inventive creations and condenses the story from the comic book series."
B0066SB8UQ This has to be the best animated adventure out there. It has a story plot that goes on and weaves it way through the story line. it has drama, adventure, action,heart and a love story of sorts as well without getting sappy and did i mention a actual story line ! Not just thrown together it is great. by the series it will be a great addition to your library"
B0066SB8UQ I checked out the pilot when I saw Sam Liu and Bruce Timm were involved, was immediately hooked and got an amazon video pass for the whole season.  At first I was skeptical of the 3D animation medium, especially since it's been done so badly before with superheroes (iron man, spiderman), but the simplified palette and detail characterized by Timm's style translated perfectly into the 3D medium.  What sealed the deal was they that they didn't skimp on details, such as the perfect syncing of the facial expressions and mouth movement to the dialog, the models being complex enough to give very human like expressions.  Clearly some pixar-level talent was involved in this series.  The art and style of this series is sublime, worthy to stand among the other feature-length animated superhero films from Sam Liu in the last half-decade.Aside from surface details, the voice acting is top-notch and the stories are amazingly well done.  The antimonitor arc was engaging and enjoyable.  It brought back some decades old memories of these green lantern stories and honors them with this modern re-imaginination."
B0066SB8UQ Ragnar, brother of Queen Iolande of Betrassus, has received a red ring as a result of his fury and jealousy at his sister's being chosen as a Green Lantern. Now the crew of the Interceptor must return to Betrassus and stop him. Meanwhile, all is not well among the on Oa. Apa, leader of the Guardians of the Universe, is determined to take down Ganthet (voiced by the late Ian Abercrombie, to whom the episode is dedicated) for embracing a \"base emotion\". Determined to help Hal Jordan and his friends, Ganthet reveals that he placed a \"protoype\" on the Interceptor before its departure based on the interaction between willpower and that \"base emotion\"...hope.The mythology of the Green Lantern comics is at its strongest in this episode, as is the quality of the show as a whole. New plot threads are added to the ever-expanding storyline of the series. The stage is set for yet another Lantern Corps to enter the mix. And the war with the Red Lanterns grows even more serious and deadly. It would appear that this season is building towards quite an exciting climax."
B0066SB8UQ I hope they make a second season.  My favorite character was not the main character, but the red lantern.  He was cooler."
B0066SB8UQ Really good series it's like a cartoon version of the movie but deeper the animation is also done well with good scripts and voices it give you a closer look on how green lantern is and the enemies he comes in contact with."
B0066SB8UQ This a good, family friendly show for all ages.  I especially like how this TV series brings together all aspects of the Green Lantern series."
B0066SB8UQ Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins.  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon.  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough. Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis. That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission.  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon, this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero.  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience. Adults and kids will watch this again and again!"
B0066SB8UQ I love being able to share some of my comic book heroes with my son who is 9 years old. Of course he thinks I should give it a 5 star review."
B0068ZCCA2 as always - great twists & turns and great challanges - never gets old to watch people being so sneaky."
B0068ZCCA2 My husband and I just started watching this show because it was on Prime.  We are hooked to the whole series!!  Best long running reality tv!"
B0068ZCCA2 I've seen several seasons of survivor.  This season was the most unsuspecting, full of surprise episodes.  Fabio's win was a perfect play using the &#34;below the radar&#34; technique.  The characters played well.  Some over played, and some simply quit playing.  Age did not matter.  All in all, Fabio's last 3 immunity wins played a factor in winning the game."
B0068ZCCA2 If you like watching people succeed at their lowest common denominator this season is for you.  There veiled bigotry, thievery, childish behavior, and selfishness.  The hungrier the contestants got the meaner they got with each other.  The black girl was an embarrassment to her race.  The old guy did nothing to assist his team in getting any rewards but he felt that he should have gone to the final three.  The nice guy would have finished last in a real life survivor situation but this case he didn't finish at all."
B0068ZCCA2 I would really like to see much earlier survivor shows, starting with the first season since I never got to watch those."
B0068ZCCA2 I am glad I didn't have to wait from week to week to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable to watch from the comforts of my home."
B0068ZCCA2 I really love the Survivor series. I like how they switched up the tribes; older and younger. It's kind of unfair to separate young vs. old but Survivor isn't about being fair and it was entertaining to watch."
B0068ZCCA2 This is the first season of survivor my GF and I have ever watched, so we actually wanted to give the show five enthusiastic stars because survivor rocks. Now that we have seen some of the other classic, more widely beloved seasons we think that three stars is a better review of Nicaragua. I don't want to give away spoilers but some of the contestants don't seem like they really want to be there, the strategy is pretty pathetic for survivor standards, and the weather is rainy for pretty much the whole season which doesn't bother me on my couch too much but it was pretty draining for the contestants."
B0068ZCCA2 Watching Boston Rob play Survivor is amazing!  A lot of crazy characters on this season makes it so much fun to watch!"
B0068ZCCA2 Always enjoy watching survivor. Jeff has kept the adventures intriguing. Recommend all seasons that are currently available. Watch and enjoy."
B0068ZCCA2 This is a fun show to watch with young teen agers. We enjoyed it and watched some of the episodes together."
B0068ZCCA2 I will always give survivor 5 stars! I am a fan since the very first season like a lot of people! Some seasons are better than others but I have never found a season I didn't like!"
B0068ZCCA2 Watchable, adequately entertaining, recycled challenges.  Players were not especially appealing and I never developed even a remote favorite.  Several players were so annoying that I wished I could have voted them off myself.  The three finalists?  Ho-hum.  Cinematography was well done and Jeff was more animate than usual."
B0068ZCCA2 BEST REAL TV SERIES YET."
B0068ZCCA2 I didn't get a chance to watch this series when it was on network tv.  But I have enjoyed watching it on Amazon especially since there aren't any commercials."
B0068ZCCA2 I haven't watched Survivor much because it seems to bring out the worst in people.  Did make an exception and watched this season to see if anything had changed and was glad to see that the most deserving person won.  Congrats to all the survivors and well played."
B006DUK1K0 I watched this not knowing what to expect.  I found it entertaining and telling a story of life in a french brothel at the turn of the century.  It turned out better than I expected when I first started watching it."
B006DUK1K0 I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections."
B006DUK1K0 I have not watched this performance I it's entirety.  Interesting watching movie with sub titles.  Intend on seeing whole movie."
B006DUK1K0 ... it is not totally surprising that life in a brothel at the turn of the century was no bed of roses (or in any brothel today except maybe the Nevada houses which seem to always have a camera trained on the smiling whores), but the depiction of a lady's first encounter with sadism is shocking, and the mood pervades the rest of the flick. The symbolic &#34;emerald&#34; is confusing."
B006DUK1K0 This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time."
B006DUK1K0 Very slow moving plot if there is one.  Trying to tell to many stories and really not showing anything really grabs you."
B006DUK1K0 Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer."
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so odd and yet I couldn't stop watching it. If you're wondering if you'd like it just know that this film (IMO) was a cross of a History Channel docu-drama, late night poorly made soft core porn and Moulin Rouge (&lt;because of the interior design and cinematography). Here are my top 10 noteworthy observations from the movie:1. As you can probably figure out by the title, this film focuses firstly on the market and exploitation of women in France come the 1900s2. ^However, the director/ writer were both clever in really drawing your attention to the different women when they were all together and everything seemed harmless, and natural and beatiful in the state of undress. Pretty much any other time you see these women (90% topless, 10% fully nude) and with a man, (maybe just me, maybe for others), but I didn't find them appealing anymore. It's as though they morphed into puppeteered china dolls that felt so lifeless yet had such entertained facade around their \"guests\". (And yes, I understand anyone might put on a facade if you were being sold for sex every night).3. You are constantly reminded in this movie that despite the care-free somewhat lux lives these women are living, they are by no means free. Every day they rack up a debt that they will never be able to re-pay4. It is strange at times as you get mixed feelings from some of the women about sex/ relationships- some speak of their 'clients' in a rather light and humorous manner, some seem like they pride themselves in their \"specialties\", while others have grown to despise sex altogether.5. The interior design and lay out of the bordello is quite beautiful (although I'd hate to see it under a black light lol)6. For how much time is spent around the characters the ending is quite disappointing but neat that they filmed this \"bordello\" in present day with it's surroundings.7. The modern music was at times an odd touch, especially when many of the characters are slow dancing in period attire to the Moody Blues, although this has been accomplished in other movies seamlessly, here it achieved quite the opposite effect.8. Very interesting undertone with the main character, as you follow her from the beginning as just another ordinary prostitute through her horrible accident, her odd dream sequence and later the revival of someone/ something else in her.9. It was very interesting to watch their use and methods of sanitation, even though many ended up getting sick or dying anyway.10. Also noteworthy is the appaling goodbye letter written to one of the women stating that since coming from an aristocratic and healthy family and despite his deep love and unquestionable willingness to sacrifice himself for her, he must not see her anymore as she has an infectious terminal illness...really?? You're more concerned about catching an STD and spreading it to your high nose aristocrat family than the fact that you have no morals or self-respect to 1. tarnish your character by going to the local whore house and 2. be a coward and liar who obviously doesn't know what deep love or self-sacrifice isOverall, it was to say the least an interesting movie, that still managed to keep my interest despite it's slow moving plot and english subtitles. I would probably only recommend this to students with interests or classes in human rights, women's rights, exploration of human sexuality, or psychology, as this movie could make for great discussions and personal interpritations."
B006DUK1K0 A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!"
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so much more than expected.  I thought it was a beautifully done movie on all counts. I thought the timing appropriate to the film and the unfolding of the story. If I was looking more for entertainment than thought provoking material this wouldn't have been my choice. The nudity was entirely used as costume, not excitement or for shock value.  It addressed the vulnerability of being female while focusing on a more specific slice of that vulnerability that is only different because of the specific exchange of coins. The era, the settings, the players make no difference in the experience or our social structure as it relates to women. The sheer sensitivity of all the people who put this together is amazing. It took great understanding to pull this off in this delicate way.  All that being said the title was completely unfortunate.  I would never have selected this movie and someone looking &#34;for a good time&#34;, will be disappointed.  The reviews should help but many go by a title.  It does not attract it's target audience. I will think about this movie while others will be frustrated. That will be what is reflected in comments."
B006DUK1K0 The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging."
B006DUK1K0 It is best movie in long time.  I loves the history and always learn something that I haven't hear or learn in the past."
B006DUK6SM \"It's takes a village to raise a child.\"  Everyone could have made a difference before it was too late if they had chosen to do so.Movies Message:  We all have choices everyday in our own \"villages\"."
B006DUK6SM This movie surpassed my expectations for it!  Maudlin and stirring with deep regret and a heartfelt sadness that is not easily expressed.  Piven is a very good actor for a young talent.  Having sons, sons who drifted away through traumatic separations make it difficult to watch.  Losing someone is a living death though they are alive; still it is like a death when they are out of a person's life.  Divorce has made a Nation full of dislocated parents and children.  Asking why a thousand times a day doesn't make it any better or different!"
B006DUK6SM What happens when you leave a child unattended for a few minutes, only to find out that the child has ventured out of the truck, in the cold winter, and is found too late. With this premise, the movie is about the parents, both a little screwed up, and certainly not parents of the year. The father, who is responsible for the event, never quite makes it through, and one can tell ahead of time where this story is heading. Sad, a great reminder that children must be under supervision at all times, and more depressing than anything else. 3 Stars."
B006DUK6SM A very good story line. A young dad takes his son in his truck into the woods,in the dead of winter, sees something, locks his son in the truck, cautioning him not to move and goes to explore.  he comes back and his son is not in the truck and not a trace of him.The rest of the plot keeps you in two minds and the endings is quite a shock."
B006DUK6SM ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11"
B006DUK6SM The plot is interesting, the characters are believable, technically great. I would like to see more of this program, and hope it makes the cut."
B006DUK6SM Ordinarily in a movie filled with grief, such as this one, there is some teaching moment - something that saves it from the pit of despair.  Now I realize that isn't life.  Life hands us grief - or, more times than not, we make our own.  I does not hand us an 'Ah Ha!' moment.  Many times movies try to do that - it doesn't here.  It leaves every individual to find their own reason based on the surface look of a mix of characters.  In other words - it's filmed grief of flawed individuals that unfortunately produced a child.  They are so absorbed by their own flaws that they really fail this child from the moment of conception.  Maybe that's the teaching moment.  It doesn't matter how much you love something or someone; if you don't pay real attention to anyone besides yourself - you will eventually call it guilt."
B006DUK6SM Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray."
B006DUK6SM and scary reminder of how quickly little people become curiously efficient! well directed/acted relationships that, like real life, are dependent on the domestic occurrences...and the invisible command to mature or deal with consequences."
B006DUK6SM Just what we need.  Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child.  This time we have Ethan (Thomas Dekker from TV's \"Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles\"), a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son.  He is divorced from his alcoholic, skanky sleep-around wife (Lynn Collins).  The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest, Montana (filmed in the Alberta Rockies), occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people, at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other.  The diner is run by Angie (Mira Sorvino), the sympathetic big sister type.  We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman.  The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer.  I mean, there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region, but you would think this guy had never seen a deer.  When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later, the kid is gone.  Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat, roll down the window and escape.Well, there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone.  No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight, married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness.  Then there's Cindy's (Collins) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A. who is going to prosecute Ethan.  Jack (Piven) it seems has a past of his own.  Something about losing his only child, but we never learn the particulars.  Then there's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy.  Whew!  There's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this, the director got too involved with the numerous characters.  In addition, some of the scenes are just ridiculous.  In one, Jack the prosecutor (Piven) shows up at a potential witness's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie...and it never comes off.  In another, Ethan decides to take Angie's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her.  This is after his son dies!  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression, albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas.  A much better, but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997)."
B006DUK6SM I rented this because Mira Sorvino was in it and the last two movies we've watched with her in it were so well-acted that now I check out any new movies that she's in.  She had a small role in this movie, but she was good in the role.What I liked about this movie was how real it felt, the acting was so good that you could actually believe they were father and son and you get lost in it that way.  The little boy steals your heart. What I didn't like was how underdeveloped the other characters were, how several side stories were introduced but went nowhere and the extremely abrupt ending.I don't regret renting it and I thought it was pretty good, but also frustrating in that it felt incomplete."
B006DUK6SM My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired."
B006DUK6SM None of the movie was a surprise but a simple depiction of tragedy. The film simply set up the scene, the basics of character, a tragic event to propel the movie There were tons of subplots hinted at and it could easily have gone off course, but it didn't.  I thought it was interesting that the film maker made the choice to remind us that everyone has their own baggage in any situation, but that doesn't  change the main focus. It really made me think about how quickly the most innocent choice could go wrong so quickly.  A bad choice could  turn even quicker and children are so quick after they learn to walk!  the town sentiments were complex and mixed in with their own personal issues, but it seemed to be a divide between those that had children and those that didn't, but there is plenty of room for differing opinions. Lovely seamless acting by everyone."
B006FKSSOY While I may find the care bears just a tad annoying my daughter loves this show. What am I to do?"
B006FKSSOY He's almost 3 years old and he loves the voices and colors in the Care Bears.  I'm not so sure he follows all the stories, but he has a great time laughing and watching it."
B006FKSSOY It's Care Bears! My kids love them and it has several episodes so your not sorting through Dvd's looking for other episodes"
B006FKSSOY This is a great show for babysitting. It keeps the young children entertained while teaching values. I recommend it to everyone."
B006FKSSOY Care Bears is a very colorful show that has a lesson for the kids to learn. My grandson really likes for me to play them on my kindle for him."
B006FKSSOY My daughter loves the care bears and these cartoons are very cute.  Nothing scarey him them and the animation is way better than the ones I grew up with."
B006FKSSOY Care bears are always uplifting, never any foul language and it shows my little ones ways to make choices.  I also like the use of color to enhance each character."
B006FKSSOY This is not the care a lot I grew up with but they are still very cute and the message is always positive. This is a great show to let your kids watch."
B006FKSSOY My 3 yo adores this updated classic. Theme song is required singing :). A classic that still teaches valuable lessons. Great pic too"
B006FKSSOY The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wantedmore and more"
B006FTBWXY Nice to watch Family and also you learn from it. A four some language not appropriate.. improve for kids to watch they are our future..."
B006FTBWXY The show is still pretty cool. Like learning about all the stuff that comes into the shop. Clean for the family."
B006FTBWXY Great show, the old man and Chumley are hillarious. I like the crew and I have learned a lot about what to look for at yard sales and thrift stores."
B006FTBWXY Unlike the ever predictable theme of every Rocky movie that came out these guys are doing the same thing all the time but have fresh stuff to show you at each show."
B006FTBWXY Love this show. I enjoy all the history you learn about a object and not to mention how much some stuff goes for."
B006FTBWXY I love this show.  Not only do you learn amazing history of the objects that come in, but the enthusiasm of Rick for his purchases is fun to see.  And the interaction between family members and staff can be hilarious. To be able to watch this show on my new ipad is absolutely wonderful."
B006FTBWXY I always learn a lot about things that people bring in to sell.  There is a lot of history behind some of the items.  Always fun to watch."
B006FTBWXY It is fun to see all of the different,and interesting, things that come into the store. It must be a very large business operation as most pawn shops that i have visited were filled with a variety of pretty common stuff.Pops, the boys, and  Chumley are the real fun entertainment of the show."
B006FTBWXY I love the historical aspects of this show.  It is outrageously fun.  All of the personalities seem to work well together."
B006FTBWXY I have the HDX 8.9&#34; and really love this show.  Being a Prime member, I especially enjoy getting certain seasons for free.  Anyway, content wise the show is wonderful.  It's always entertaining because you never know what someone is bringing in.  Picturewise, the picture is excellent in HD.  This is just a great investment in your entertainment."
B006FTBWXY the store receives some pawns that are old, artistic, motorhead, canons, vintage guns and much ..much more..it's nice to see some comedic interactions with store workers also.."
B006FTBWXY Love the family and chumley too. Rick loves History and me as we ll. I hope to some day go in shop and buy something that I don t need, that somebody else didn t need and then pass it down to somebody that doesn t need it either"
B006FTBWXY I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments."
B006FTBWXY well: this is a 2 Disc set beginning with Darth Pawn & ending with Take a Seat which is from 2011 & NO NEW DVDS yet! Now they cut & edit their own programs to sneak in additional ads. But I digress. If you LOVE the guys, you WILL Luv the episodes but we are willing to get more dvds & everything stopped. There are other Pawns but they're basically Reissues or as they call them &#34;Fan Favorites&#34;. I've written A&E & HISTORY to no avail & no answers. Lousy marketing in our opinions. We can't afford the Instant Seasons that are available either."
B006FTBWXY If you follow this show you know that over the seasons they have started to focus on &#34;storylines&#34; about each member of the show (Rick, Cory, The Old Man and Chumley). I don't watch the show for this stupidity, I enjoy seeing the items that come in, learning about them and what they are worth.  I really wish they would focus on that more and less on these silly stories that no one cares about."
B006FTBWXY Love the Pawn Stars guys and this is another great season.  Hope to see season 6 and 7 next on Prime.  I like to learn about things and watch this guys, they always make me smile."
B006FTBWXY When this show originated, I never expected it to last.  As it progressed, I became hooked on trying to evaluate the various items brought in.As the show progressed, my opinion of the blue-collar, poor grammar guys in the shop really upsurged.  They really know their history and business.  From fine art to antique artifacts, these guys are truly knowledgeable way beyond the poor knowledge demonstrated of their native language.The show is compelling, kind of like a poor man's PBS Antique's Road Show."
B006FTBWXY We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!"
B006FTBWXY Love this season as I do all of their seasons. Chum lee and the guys are as always great. Love the new shop"
B006FTBWXY My family and I love this show and the staff.  We mainly watch it because of the history we learn about the artifacts."
B006FTBWXY The show features a trio of men who seem to really enjoy how they make a living by buying and selling some very unusual items. Once in awhile someone will show up with a rare, almost priceless item that they want to sell. That's where the fun begins. Is it real or is it fake?  This keeps the interest high, making the show well worth watching."
B006FTBWXY In every episode you learn bits of history behind the items brought into the pawn shop, all while being entertained.  And who knows, maybe you have a valuable treasure sitting in the closet. :)"
B006FTBWXY Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get \"x\" number of episodes for \"x\" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Five of \"Pawn Stars\" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, coming from most of Season Four.  If you have collected the earlier entries in the Pawn Stars DVD releases, this is the next group of chronological episodes.  There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Darth Pawn, (2) Put Up Your Dukes, (3) Pawn Illustrated, (4) Striking A Chord, (5) Harrison For President, (6) Wise Guys, (7) Robosaurus, (8) Ah, Shoot!, (9) Going Postal, (10) Chummobile, (11) Evel Genius, (12) Pablo Pawncasso, (13) Sub For Sale, (14) Missile Attack, (15) Not On My Watch, and (16) Take A Seat.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic \"Antiques Roadshow\" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 8/12,"
B006FTBWXY Please read my review of Volume 6.Not too much has changed.I reviewed #6 before #5 so the review process is backwards.This is an unusual series.Much like &#34;Antique Road Show&#34;but in a pawn shop."
B006FTBWXY Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop.  However, I am extremely tired of the jousting, barbs and insults form the Old Man (especially), and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum.  I've stopped watching almost.  I don't watch nearly as much as I did in the past."
B006FTBWXY Here is a vidio set that is so neat to think history is still in the hands of folks that don't always know what they have.  Fun and a great way to discover things about history you may have never known."
B006FTBWXY I love the Pawn Stars series, particularly because we can't watch it on television so being able to rent it from Amazon is a plus. What's not to like with 4-5 fat guys showing off their knowledge of historic object (and some not so historic). Satisfies an inner need for greed."
B006FTBWXY chumlee is the star of the show. rick is the brains. their antic are almost as good as I love lucy. Plus you get and education as well."
B006FTBWXY The is a very fun show. You just can't watch one. Great entertainment plus you always learn something as well."
B006FTBWXY Big Hoss is stepping it up to try and assert his place as a co-owner of the Pawn Shop.  Very interesting dynamics in a great setting with lots of interesting characters and items coming thru the doors."
B006FTBWXY A lot of set-ups, but that's OK. Takes all kinds to make the world go around. Like to see it in person."
B006FTBWXY We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but...Amazon's responsiveness has been horrid!!! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos. I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode (which we loved).The problem isn't once the streaming starts, but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started. I'm using a Roku3 box."
B006FTBWXY Addictive show and a huge hit now. You really learn interesting tidbits about old merchandise and historic pieces. And with money involved, it keeps you watching. I will say the current seasons are coming up with more nonsense with the crew. Very pre-scripted stuff. Many items brought in lately are guns and books. I prefer movie props myself."
B006FTBWXY Love the people, history lessons and fun they have.  Three generation shows a deep love as well as real conflict. We often wonder who and where are the women in their life."
B006FTBWXY I enjoy this show very much.  It is interesting to watch the various items that come in for sale and the negotiations that take place between the seller and the pawn shop owners.  Some sellers over value their product while some under value their product and the pawn shop owners have to sort it out while trying to make a profit.  It is all very entertaining."
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining.  I think Chumlee is really cool.  The old man is hysterical.  They're all good.  Keep them coming. Voila!"
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining, and enlightenment of what articles are really worth. I'd recommend this program to anyone who has old memorabilia lying around to watch this program."
B006FTBWXY My whole family likes this show.  We love the different historical finds.  We like to know what an object is worth and what you can get monetarily from one.  The family chemistry is fun to watch.  We have recommended this show to our friends and family."
B006FTBWXY The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television."
B006FTBWXY Viva Las Vegas! Where else would you find characters like this. Entertaining and educational with a bit of real life drama."
B006FTBWXY I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time."
B006FTBWXY I love pawn stars, so of course I like volume 5. If u like the earlier seasons then you'll like this one. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes reality tv."
B006FTBWXY We love watching this show. You learns something new about antiques and see what people have collected in their attics or cellars ~ that are worth some money! Makes you wish you'd kept some of those old items you tossed years ago :)"
B006FTBWXY Fun to see what kind of things make it into a Pawn Store. The items are interesting as well as the people that bring in the items.The family dynamics are also entertaining"
B006FTBWXY If this show would stop interrupting itself with SCRIPTED NONSENSE, it would be nearly perfect for what it is.  Interesting transactions and conversations of historical relevance with customers and experts are the highlights of this show.  Here we have people who are genuinely interesting WITHOUT SCRIPTED SCENES, participating in fake pranks and telling poorly-timed jokes.  It just stinks of audience manipulation and poor writing.  Neither of which belong in a &#34;REALITY&#34; TV show.I blame the show runners.  They need to be fired.  Let's just follow the &#34;Pawn Stars&#34; on their terms and hear from them and let reality HAPPEN instead of manipulating it.  I think these guys are interesting people.  Let THEM run the show.  Let THEM decide how to film.If the fake crap does not stop, I am not going to view this anymore--and I suggest you avoid it too.  Why participate in time-wasting TV tactics?  I tune in to observe experts and pawn professionals do their thing.  This is not supposed to be the next &#34;Three's Company.&#34;Otherwise, the show is great because Chumlee, The Old Man, Rick, and Corey are good, unique, and often funny people.  When not scripted, of course."
B006FYDKMA The best pickers in the Biz, been watching these guys since they started the show and love every episode.  Well produced with great audio and video quality."
B006FYDKMA THIS show is fun to watch for the entire family,teaches our our younger generations how things used to be,when the guys find old hidden treasures from the past..these &#34;pickers&#34; are not afraid to get their hands dirty,sometime s climbing through piles of storages things,to find a &#34;honey hole&#34;of special items from America's past.They travel America's back roads,again teaching us all what great country we live in."
B006FYDKMA Great way to pick up on some history and american culture.  This show will make you a better negotiator at yard sales."
B006FYDKMA This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys."
B006FYDKMA After all these years this show still amuses me in what they do. Every time I watch it I actually learn something. Its still as good as it was when it first started."
B006FYDKMA I've watched seasons 1 - 4 so far and enjoyed them all.  Mike and Frank set up a friendly bantering when they are on the road.  It is fascinating to see the &#34;rusty gold&#34; that they find in some people's piles of junk."
B006FYDKMA How absolutely cool it is to see inside the daily lives and jobs of three very cool people !and the treasures they find are more often the people they meet than the stuff they collect."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank seem like guys I could hang out with, I enjoy the dynamic of the two of them driving around in the van and the interactions they have with the people they pick. I also love the stories that go along with the treasures that they find. It didn't hurt that I only paid $9.99 for the entire season, Mike, that's what we call &#34;breaking the ice&#34;."
B006FYDKMA I almost feel like I am picking with them or at one of their stores. I enjoy learning about the pickers and their customers. It is fun to be told what an item was originally used for."
B006FYDKMA Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting."
B006FYDKMA Its refreshing to see nice guys doing well in business -- treating others fairly, not trying to swindle, cheat, beat or climb over others as a way of doing business. They make it pleasurable for all! Very enjoyable show."
B006FYDKMA Many years spent riding with my dad doing just the same thing, meeting folks and picking!  Can't beat it.  You meet some crazy, funny and interesting people who widen your horizons and expand your knowledge and just plain have fun!  I can even almost guess the prices they will pay and what they will sell it for.  It is great to see them treat people fairly and just enjoy themselves.  Good fun!"
B006FYDKMA My wife and I can't get enough of this show.  Mike and Frank (and Dani) are entertaining, the stuff they find is amazing, and the information they supply on history of the objects is usually quite interesting"
B006FYDKMA This is a great consept for a show. I watch every episode i can. I like the way the guys treat everyone they meet."
B006FYDKMA Two childhood friends travel across America searching for the old and the unusual.  They take these items out of hiding and sell them in their store to other people who appreciate the history behind them.  Their enthusiasm for the history behind the items and their excitement in finding them is infectious."
B006FYDKMA I'm not a reality TV? Fan but I do enjoy this show, the guys are fun and funny. As is the gal in the store. A key part of the team. Finding and sending the guys to a good picking site. All in all, a fun entertaining and even educational, whenThey find an object, and can give us it's history,You won't be disappointed, if you watch this, show, and all the characters, they run into."
B006FYDKMA These two give a glimpse of how things were in the &#34;good old days.&#34; Mike and Frank are always on the lookout for things that bring back the past in rural America. They have lots of fun looking, and we have fun watching them look."
B006FYDKMA I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing."
B006FYDKMA Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released \"Pawn Stars: Volume Three,\" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released \"American Pickers: Volume Two,\" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for \"American Pickers,Volume 4.\"I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two \"pickers\" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic \"Antique Roadshow\" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of \"Storage Wars\" with a dash of \"Hoarders\" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have great personalities and in-depth knowledge of antique junk! It's a junk history lesson on things I have thrown away. It's easy to get hooked on these episodes."
B006FYDKMA My husband and I enjoy American Pickers. This show captures audiences both old and young. Very diverse and entertaining. Funny!"
B006FYDKMA Ride again!You just can't go wrong with these guys, (and gals...).  Okay, I take issue with some of his motorcycle &#34;expertise&#34;, (having ridden and worked on / for the Big Twin for most of my life), but it's STILL one of the original and best series of it's kind available today."
B006FYDKMA The chase is on to a reality show that is fun and amazing in the search of America's lost treasures.  You will love it and a must for trivia and seakers of the past ."
B006FYDKMA I love American Pickers I have watched almost every episode at least once some several times. Started watching it the first season and would record it on the DVR.  Since we have had Amazon Prime we have watched all of those shows and the newer ones too. Appreciate not having to lose them after a year or so.  They are fun to review."
B006FYDKMA Amazing show with both history and entertainment. The stuff they run into keeps you wondering what they will find next. Mike and Frank are great together and make the show flow."
B006FYDKMA I just get a kick out of watching these guy come up with treasures out of junk heaps.  They seem to have a knack for finding some real unusual characters along the way too.  I recommend this show to anyone."
B006FYDKMA Great show!! Looking forward to more episodes! Love what they find, they have given me idea's on how to re use old items."
B006FYDKMA Am always entertained at their ability to talk prices down, But am always educated as to history of antiques and the such. Love their chemistry and the occasional danielle pick."
B006FYDKMA GREAT SHOW!!! MY BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SHOW& I LOVE IT.... SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED AMAZON &#34;PRIME&#34; (FREE) I SNAPED IT UP!!!!"
B006FYDKMA Yay...love these guys and the people that they find. Always a good time filler!"
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have the best jobs in the world! I wish I could do what they do. They inspire me to do some picking."
B006FYDKMA I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together."
B006FYDKMA History, stories and junk combined and delivered by two real characters. An educational, human interest tour-de-force. I can't wait for the next season to go Prime."
B006FYDKMA I really enjoy seeing the Pickers find some great stuff.  I bring back memorials and also gives you some history."
B006FYDKMA Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!"
B006FYDKMA Never get tired of seeing what they will find next on their trail for the next great collectible.  Their searches for stuff is fun to watch...almost like an antique scavenger hunt!  As a collector myself with over 500 advertising signs and other collectibles, I can appreciate their enthusiasm for the &#34;hunt&#34; ... just don't come to my house looking for stuff!"
B006GM4JNU This might be the only Disney show that's actually worth watching.  It is very entertaining and has a nice range of characters."
B006GM4JNU &#34;Whatcha doing?&#34; Watching Phineas and Ferb, probably. :-) It's nice to have the episodes available on demand and not have to scour the TV listings to see when it is on. Each episode is great and there are many layers to explore for everyone, kids and adults."
B006GM4JNU My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play nice and smooth over our Roku box."
B006GM4JNU This is a great show for kids. It is one that does not need to be reviewed. Your kids can just watch it."
B006GM4JNU I like the show, but Candace gets on my nerves. She is such a drama queen and yells waayyyy to much. I think Phineas and Ferb are really cool, creative and smart though. The villian and Perry is also a cool part of the show. The villian is almost likeable. Which is good. He's just a bit misguided."
B006GM4JNU I will cheerfully admit to being a childless adult that enjoys this show. Kids can't appreciate so much of what makes this show funny. The songs are great and so are the characters. I cannot recommend this show enough. It is truly creative and deserving of your time."
B006GM4K2A This is by far my favorite Disney show.  I think it is very imaginative and smart.  My wife and I like it just as much as the kids do."
B006GM4K2A If you like the show you'll love this Phineas and Ferb season. It's fun for the whole family... even grandma!"
B006GM4K2A Mom loves the show for the pure genius that is Phineas and Ferb and their inventions. Son (who is an adult, but started watching the show when he was in the &#34;proper&#34; demographic), loves the antics and is seeing the layers of the show now. In fact, at work, one of the teams that Mom is on had a &#34;homework&#34; assignment where someone who had never seen the show (only one out of the 6 team members) had to report on what &#34;OWCA&#34; stood for. This is a show that adults can enjoy while the kids are watching, too."
B006GM4K2A My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play great over our Roku box."
B006GM4K2A The show has broad appeal to girls and boys; various ages and interest. I like the shows Imagination and modern approach to story telling."
B006GM4K2A My six year old loves it as does my husband. The only thing that gets on my nerves is Candane is an annoying drama queen. And the mushy love stuff between Candace and Jeremy and Isabella and Phineas is a bit too adult for kids. The evil villian is not scary at all. Perry and the evil guy are funny,but there is some physical violence between them. It's short lived but still short lived. Take a look and see what you think before you let the kids watch. It is meant for older kids age 7 and up."
B006GM4K2A I am a childless adult who was introduced to the show by a friend. It is genuinely funny and most episodes are memorable. The songs are great and the characters are strong. Kids can't really appreciate why it is so funny. Highly recommended."
B006H0602Y When I was 21, I worked in a convenience store.  No, I know what you're thinking, but that wasn't the impressive part.  While I was working there, one night a guy came in and asked me if I wanted to manage a rock band.  How could I say, \"No\"?OK; so I wasn't going to manage that band per se.  I was going to be a roadie.  Whatever.  But just like the lead in this film -- Ron Eldard, who plays his part perfectly with a bittersweet edge -- I sucked it up and I setup and I tore down equipment nightly, for the betterment of the band.  And Rock And Roll.I should have seen the writing on the wall when, one night, most of the guitarist's equipment was stolen from the back of The Van.  (And no, I wasn't at fault on that one.  I don't even think that I was important enough to have keys to The Van.)  But it gets worse.  Since I played guitar at the time, he asked me if he could use my equipment that night.  I said, \"Sure!\" which was really stupid, but it didn't work out as poorly as it could have.  At least neither my Wa-Wa nor Chorus pedal were stolen that night.But my final paycheck from the band bounced, which was surely a bummer, and that's how it became \"final.\"  I worked really hard for that money; surely harder than the band ever did.  I knew that they probably weren't going anywhere, based upon the fact that they were a local band, and based upon the fact that they mostly played Frat parties, and further based upon the fact that they weren't as well known as Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).Now, if you were a metalhead from that era, you surely had the opinion that BOC was borderline lame.  You had Ozzy Ozbourne, who had the great Randy Rhoads on guitar.  (Check out the scene where our protagonist is going back into his bedroom for the first time in many years.  An iconic picture of Mr. Rhoads playing his iconic flying-V is hanging on the wall.  Now there was a guitarist!  Unlike that hack guitarist from BOC, whoever he was.)  And you had bands such as Judas Priest and The Scorpions, who could go all cow-bell all over BOC.  Even on the worst of nights.I did find it interesting that the writer and director chose to go with BOC as the band-that-never-appears here.  Whatever.  That was fine.  Maybe they just paid a small royalty to use the name?  (And surely that royalty was small.)  Perhaps they wanted to use a lame band since our protagonist could be called -- and I apologize -- somewhat lame, even though he is very sympathetic.  But the band itself doesn't matter, as I give nothing away as I say that the movie begins with the protagonist being fired, via phone call, from the band that he \"manages,\" err, \"roadies\" for.There are quite a few themes going on here, but one of them surely is \"looking back, nothing was ever as good as it seemed.\"  Just by looking in his eyes, you can tell that the protagonist realizes all that he's missed out on in life by pursuing his dreams, dreams that surely never materialized.  But his \"friends\" -- they were more like \"frenemies\" -- regret their lives as well, as they believe that maybe he lived a better life than they ever did.  Well, they're both wrong of course, as all of their lives were perhaps just ordinary.Not to give anything else away, but maybe instead of trying to be a rock star, one should simply be happy with the simple things in life, such as being a gardener?  That might be the real moral of the story as the credits roll.  And perhaps, \"I need more cowbell -- AND more films like 'Roadie.'\"  A pretty big recommendation on a film that brought back many memories, at least for me."
B006H0602Y ------------------------------------------------\"Roadie\"(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
B006H0602Y By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSJimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) has been living his dream for over 20 years. He has been a roadie for Blue Oyster Cult. The key words are \"has been.\" Blue Oyster Cult has quit filling large arenas and have cut back on equipment and personnel. Jimmy is a victim of that downsizing.Since Jimmy doesn't have any other skill sets he limps back home to his mother.He hasn't seen her or talked to her since his father died. She is developing Dementia. The band continues to tour in South America but Jimmy's repeated calls go unanswered.After seeing what has happened to his mom he makes up a more successful Jimmy. He says he's become the band's manager, even produced and written some songs for them and is simply visiting before he must get on the road again because, \"they are lost without him.\"Downtrodden he walks into town to get a drink. There he becomes reacquainted with his longtime nemesis Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) who has inherited his dad's car lot and married the girl, Nikki (Jill Hennessy) who Jimmy uses to pine for. I should say still pines for.The problem is Jimmy never grew up. He still harbours the regrets and frustrations that he's carried with him. The road was the only thing that gave him a feeling of normal ... his only true home. Now he's forced to make a life changing decision - either step up, tell the truth and take on the responsibility of his ailing mother or continue to live a lie.This is a neat little drama filled with great music."
B006H0602Y Ron Eldard and the rest of the cast have a great movie here. So typical and excellent script. All the characterizations are dead-on."
B006H0602Y This movie is amazing. Let me share, perhaps against your will, some personal data. I am 53, going back to my hometown I left 30 years ago. I have a life time of experiences spent apart from my old friends and enemies. I will see some of my old friends and daughter from times long gone during this trip. The feelings I am having, and the imagining of what may come are so close to what this movie conveys. Going back, after so long, to see what has been and perhaps your life under different experiences. This movie seems so real that it feels like I could have experienced it. Don't miss this one."
B006H0602Y Blue Oyster Cult was/is a Long Island rock band that peaked in the mid-70's with the classic \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" In this indi-drama, Ron Eldard (\"Super 8\") plays Jimmy, a roadie on their tour for the past 20 some years.  For reasons unexplained, he is fired, by telephone no less.  With no job, no money and no prospects he decides to go to the house where he grew up in Queens, N. Y.  His mother (veteran actress Lois Smith), hardly recognizes him.  Except for one day when his father died, Jimmy hadn't been back since he first left home and went on tour.While sipping a cocktail at a local saloon, Jimmy runs into an old high school nemisis (Bobby Cannavale) and his wife and Jimmy's former girlfriend (Jill Hennessy).  Nikki (Hennessy) is a struggling solo artist, but seems happy in her life which includes singing before 30 or 40 people.  We can pretty much see where this is all heading but, it really doesn't.  Although Nikki does stop by Jimmy's house and visits his old bedroom which his mother had kept intact (complete with vinyl albums and a working turntable), their high school memories are just that.There really isn't much of a story here.  The actors do their part well, but they don't have much to work with.  Although a night out with plenty of booze and cocaine produces an opportunity to let loose, the story peters out the next day.  In addition to some fine performances, the soundtrack should satisfy most from this rock and roll generation.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is fine if unspectacular.  A bit soft here and there but nothing problematic.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is solid especially with the dialog.  I guess I was expecting a bit more with the musical influences.  Again, not necessarily of concern."
B006H0602Y I was at about 3-1/2 stars on this one.  It was a cool movie.  Kinda reminds me of going home, and seeing people you haven't seen in years."
B006H0602Y Somewhat slow-moving and depressing, but great acting and feels 'real'. Makes you think about what could have been, and the lead character's life is sad, but realistic. A good renter."
B006H0602Y Thoughtful and well-written.Thought provoking.  Opportunities, choices, consequences. It's strange to think that the decisions  made before age 25, when we are all impaired with an undeveloped brain, directs the course of our adult  lives. It's frightening to realize that our  immature self with no life experience or health insurance, focused on wine, women & song,  is choosing our life path .  No wonder we wake up at 40, 50, or 60 dissatisfied and paniced.  The dream we followed was that of a child, using the experience, knowledge, and education of a child to dictate our lives in retirement. How does that make sense? How does the 15 year old self, dreaming of being a Rock star,  playing air guitar to the radio  in his parents  home rent free, occasionally hitting them up for gas/grass money , possibly know  enough or have enough skills to make life decisions?

B006H0602Y Roadie (2011) tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown, after being unceremoniously fired from his job of twenty plus years, as a roadie for the rock band Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).  It's a poignant look at the past and the present, as pride prevents the rocker from telling the truth about his situation, to his mother, and those he grew up with.  While the characters might seem a bit clich&eacute;d and stereotyped, when put together they complement each other, and seem to belong to the same universe.  Familiarity with the music featured in the film is not essential, but adds greatly to its impact.Jimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) arrives at his childhood home in Forrest Hills, New York, and instead of telling his mother (Lois Smith) that he has been fired, he claims to be the manager for Blue Oyster Cult, and is visiting before the band leaves on a tour of South America.  Jimmy repeatedly calls and leaves messages for someone named \"Bobby\", in connection with his situation, but never receives a return call.In a bar, Jimmy runs into Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale), a guy that tormented him in high school, who dredges up unpleasant memories, when he uses the nickname \"Jimmy Testicles\".  Randy now owns a car dealership, and his wife Nikki (Jill Hennessy), was once Jimmy's girlfriend.  Nikki sings and plays guitar, and is at the bar warming up for a performance that night.  Continuing the lie, the couple are suitably impressed by Jimmy's \"success\", as manager and contributing songwriter for BOC.With posters of Phil Lynott and Randy Rhodes on the wall, Jimmy and Nikki listen to the music of the Good Rats, as they reminisce in his bedroom, which has been preserved like a shine by Jimmy's mom.  Later Jimmy is picked up by Randy, and is taken to a motel, where Nikki is getting ready for her show.  Fueled by music, alcohol, and cocaine, what starts out as a fun time headbanging to BOC's \"See You In Black\", later turns ugly, as old demons resurface, and feelings are hurt.Directed and co-written by Michael Cuesta (Homeland, Dexter), Roadie is a \"little\" movie that may not fully resonate with those who don't have the life experiences to appreciate some of its nuances, but most can relate to some of the basic themes being examined.  Jimmy's embarrassment is completely understandable, and his deception is like a sitcom clich&eacute;, where a boast or prank goes too far.  Peter on the Brady Bunch claiming to know Joe Namath, is just one of many examples.  In this case however, things feel more real, as matters don't play out as silly harmless fun, with several allusions to much darker possibilities.Ron Eldard (Sleepers) is perfect as a burned out rocker still trying to cling to the ways of his youth.  Waxing poetic on the significance of BOC, and the talents of guitarist Buck Dharma, Jimmy is truly in his element.  Still bitter that his father crushed his musical dreams, his success is largely dependent on the talent of others.Lois Smith (Twister,Five Easy Pieces) is spot on as Jimmy's mom, who still has the ability to transform the forty year-old, into a little boy.  Many could play a loudmouth prick, but Bobby Cannavale does it with an authentic sense of New York style.  The talented and versatile Jill Hennessey (Law & Order,Crossing Jordan), is always a pleasure to watch.  Her musical talents bring great realism to Nikki, who is struggling with her own unrealized dreams.  Hennessy performs part of \"Ghost In My Head\", the title track from her 2009 album.While not completely original, Roadie largely works because it is thoughtfully written, and features some extremely talented actors.  Providing ample opportunities for reflection, this is a particularly interesting watch for those who have faced a midlife crisis, and is punctuated by a selection of music, which adds firmly to the film's impact.  Among the featured songs are Robin Trower's \"About To Begin\" and \"Long Misty Days\", Jethro Tull's haunting \"My God\", Blue Oyster Cult's \"Cites on Flame\", and perhaps most apropos, as it deals with the life of a roadie, \"The Load Out\", which is unfortunately not the original version performed by Jackson Browne."
B006H06CFO Answers to Nothing almost became a 3-star movie but thanks to the final 30 minutes making a dramatic improvement in storytelling, it's only fair to award it 4 stars.  It's about four separate stories happening at once, and I'll list them right now:1- Dane Cook is NOT a comedian in this film.  Let that be known right off the bat.  Instead he cheats on his wife with a woman who looks and sings remarkably similar to the legendary Patti Smith.  As you can guess, he's cheating because he doesn't get along with his wife.  Unfortunately there's a few exceptionally graphic and inappropriate sexual related scenes in the very beginning that I didn't really care for, however I suppose having \"it\" happen during a story about a World War II soldier parachuting down to a house in France with an attractive inside is an interesting spin.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.2- An African American woman who has a certain hatred for other black folks and seeks help with a counselor to figure out why.  Sort of pointlessly weaved into the storyline if you ask me, since if you were to remove this segment it wouldn't have been a big loss.3- An attractive blonde-haired detective woman who wants to bring down a potential suspect involved in the abduction of a child that she strongly believes is responsible for the childs disappearance.  Unfortuantely this segment was *severely* lacking.  At least, the scenes involving the detective.  There's a REALLY good segment with the suspect near the end concerning a house break-in that's easily the best part of the movie.4- A woman who has to take care of her paralyzed brother by bathing and taking him for walks in his wheelchair.  I suppose her intention here is to get into proper running shape so she can continue to have the strength to take care of him, but the fact that she was in desperate need of assistance because of how straining of a job it was leads to some interesting segments with her family later on, and especially memorable is the running marathon segment near the end.The only problem is that on a few occasions the storyline really drags, especially from the 30 minute mark until the 1 hour and 15 minute mark.  That's a good 45 minutes of lackluster entertainment that tells a decent enough story to get the job done, but never does anything that truly stands out.  This is why it's quite difficult to give the movie 5 stars.  However the ending is REALLY darn good- all the events are convincingly and thoroughly explained by the conclusion.  Good movie."
B006H06CFO Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways. Grady Harp, August 12"
B006H06CFO This is what we call a major league indy plot with loosely connected characters...intertwine is the phrase they like to use to make it sound artsy. There is a missing young girl. Beckworth (Greg Germann) the neighbor is a person of interest. Frankie (Julie Benz) is the investigating officer. Her friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) is the sweetest thing this side of candy, and she is married to a psychologist Ryan (Dane Cook) who lies and cheats. One of his patients is TV writer Allegra (Kali Hawk) who is African-American and hates blacks. There is also a woman who cares for her brother. He is in a vegetative state. She wants to push his wheelchair in a marathon. There is also a rock band, the woman Ryan is cheating with, a rookie cop, and a teacher so obsessed with the missing girl, that it screws up his on-line video role playing game.The film builds up multiple characters in a mostly boring fashion. It isn't until the climatic ending that you begin to feel you have just seen a decent film. This film reminded me in many ways of another indie, \"Garden Party.\" If you don't like one story or character, wait it will change. The acting was exceptional well, however a story being all over the place is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are not an indie fan, you may not enjoy this feature.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
B006H06CFO Every now and then a gem that i've never heard of sneaks up on me.Once in a while when you read the plot on the cover of the dvd at the rental store it doesn't let you down.\"Answers To Nothing\" fit that bill for me.What a little gem this movie is!It starts with a little girl getting kidnapped from her bedroom in the night by a deviant but in between the manhunt for the criminal and her is a bunch od stories mixed into thru the movie.A woman who takes care of her invalid brother and desperately tries to keep custody of him,even enters both of them in the l.a marathon,very heartwarming story.A couple trying to conceive by artificial ensemination,a man obsessed with the child kidnapping case,etc.Rent it...you won't be disapointed!!! 5 stars easily !!!"
B006H06CFO \"I'm buried in the armor, I'm an iron man.\" After a child is abducted this movie deals with the following five days and a group of people including the single mom who is investigating the case. Her sister (Mitchell) who wants to get pregnant badly but her husband (Cook) is cheating on her. A school teacher who is obsessed with finding the missing girl. An alcoholic who is taking care of her wheel chair bound brother and a self hating black woman who wants to fall in love. I have to begin by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. Very slow moving in some parts and not a happy movie at all. That said I really enjoyed this. Dane Cook is a huge surprise in this role and is actually a very good dramatic actor. This movie shows how each person is somehow intertwined in each other's lives and how one life effects the other. While not nearly as good as \"Crash\" it does have that type of feel to it. This is a movie that you must be in the mood for and is a struggle at first, but the last half hour makes you glad you stuck with it. Overall, the type of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it is over. I recommend this. I give it a B."
B006I0GSZM This is a mediocre rendition of a Stephen King novel of the same name.It dragged a great deal and was more unpleasant than scary.A shame as the book was great"
B006I0GSZM If you are a Steven King fan, you will love this movie.  This held my interest from the very beginning to the end. I love thriller and suspense movies and this one fit that bill.  I loved the story line and the suspense was on the edge of your seat.  Absolutely loved it!  I gave it 5 stars as the acting, story line and the fact that Steven King did it again........so well!  Highly recommend it."
B006I0GSZM As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
B006I0GSZM It must have been deliberate.  Pierce Brosnan, of all people, looks like Stephen King in this adaptation of his novel!  The novel was one of King's best because he managed at long last to combine a horror story with a love story.  Love stories prior to this had pretty much eluded him although he tried. The tv show is rendered in much broader and bolder strokes than the novel.  There is always that tendency in screen adaptations of novels though.The scary stuff is plenty scary.  There is ghost after ghost in creepy rendition after creepy rendition.  If you are in the mood for horror, this is the tv show for you.The protagonist's wife is killed  in traffic while he is at a book signing.  He is devastated and retreats to their lakeside home in Maine. There he begins to wonder if his wife was seeing someone else.  He also meets someone new but she is locked in a custody battle with her child's rich paternal grandfather. It turns out to be a lot more complex problem though than an affair or a custody battle.  There is a mystery going back to his grandfather's generation which affected a circle of young men from the 1930s.King's best screen adaptations were Kubrick's THE SHINING starring Jack Nicholson, Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME with the late River Phoenix, Christopher Walken starring in his DEAD ZONE, Kathy Bates in her Oscar winning role with James Caan in MISERY and Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in CARRIE. Those are pretty lofty standards for others to try to meet.  That is heavyweight film talent. They are all either Oscar winners or Oscar nominees. So doing it on tv with a good actor, but hardly a Walken, Caan or Nicholson, gives this less of a chance right from the start.  BAG OF BONES is a good job but it is not up there with these now classic five star films."
B006I0GSZM I also watched Bag of Bones on DVD which is based on a novel by Stephen King. I bought the book years ago on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Nobles. I read it quickly and loved it. When the miniseries aired back in December, I had other things going on and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Bag of Bones is good, but several things have been changed and left out from the book. I love ghost stories, so I naturally love it despite of it's flaws."
B006I0GSZM This Stephen King adaptation is much more entertaining and colorful than many of the other reviews here let on.  I'll admit, important elements of the novel were missing in this mini-series.  The single-mom character was much more complex and fleshed out in the novel, and some of the stranger, more interesting images and scenes from the book didn't make it into the movie.  However, I thought the ghost-story-mystery aspect of the film was old-fashioned and deliberately paced, and I thought it was very entertaining.  I like the fact that the movie slows down to tell the story without a lot of quick cuts and abrasive sound effects.  Pierce Brosnan's obsessive grief comes across as completely credible, in my opinion, and his performance goes a long way in making events believable.  Is this a higher-end King adaptation?  No, it is not.  However, I did think it was fun and engaging.  You might want to give it a chance if you're a fan of the kind of atmosphere and scripting that older ghost stories take on (Ghost Story, The Changeling, etc.).  After all of the terrible reviews I've read for this, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie."
B006I0GSZM I thought it was good and wished it would have continued. The storyline was sad, but it was well written and there were times when I couldn't tell what was real and what was not real."
B006I0GSZM Had read the book many years ago and decided to watch this. Almost four hours long, if remember correctly, in two parts. Good acting and a very engaging story line. I am used to the edgier approach of movies instead of the restrained presentation of TV movies. That said, it was time well spent."
B006I0GSZM The sound was excellent.  The costumes, brilliant. Acting was right on for King 's book. It is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment."
B006I0GSZM Out of Stephen King's countless books, \"Bag of Bones\" is probably the easiest to adapt -- it's a straightforward ghost story about revenge, murder and writer's block.So of course it was eventually adapted into a TV miniseries of the same name, with Pierce Brosnan playing a bestselling author (take a shot) staying in a small Maine town (take a shot) with some ugly skeletons in its closet. The first half is a tedious affair, mostly setting up various clues for Brosnan -- but the second half is a genuinely disturbing, heartrending tale.After his pregnant wife Jo (Annabeth Gish) is killed by a runaway bus, writer Mike Noonan (Brosnan) is understandably devastated. He also finds himself unable to write, so he ends up heading off to the Maine lake-house that Jo had been fixing up for several months. He also is grappling with suspicions that Jo was unfaithful to him, since he was told that they couldn't have children.But during his stay, he begins to see strange ghostly events -- fridge magnets spell out messages, strong winds blow, and the music of 1930s blues singer Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) plays. Soon Mike figures out that there are two ghosts: one is Jo, and the other is far more malevolent.He also inadvertently becomes involved in a custody battle between wealthy, cruel Max Devore (William Schallert) and his beautiful daughter-in-law Mattie (Melissa George) over Mattie's young daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael). But as Mike tries to figure out why Devore wants his granddaughter, he learns of a string of brutal murders stretching back through the years -- and the terrible crimes that started it all.The first episode of \"Bag of Bones\" moves at a very slow pace, primarily devoted to setting up the clues and the whole custody battle. In fact, a lot of it is about Mike drifting around, struggling to write and having strange visions that are (of course) prophetic -- and if it weren't for the occasional ghostly visitations, you might forget that this is a Stephen King story.One advantage of the slow episode is that it gives Brosnan plenty of time to develop Mike. Yes, he's another bestselling writer character with a personal tragedy, but it feels so much more REAL with Brosnan. He really makes you feel the life-destroying anguish of losing your spouse (possibly drawing from experience), and the passionate paternal feelings that Kyra stokes in him.But the second episode lashes together the horror, clues and custody battle into one dark, bloody package -- and suddenly the horror is flowing pretty quickly. Ironically, the most horrifying part is the human capacity for brutality (a graphic rape-murder scene, the attempts to kill children), but there is still plenty of ropy-faced zombies, curses and the occasional crazy old crone throwing rocks or scissors.One major problem, however, is Max Devore and his crazy sidekick Rogette. These characters are so utterly, revoltingly, sadistically evil that they become cartoons rather than antagonists -- it wouldn't surprise me if they tortured puppies for fun. And it's never really explained why various men want to kill a kid who isn't theirs. Do they think it will lift the curse? I have no idea.It takes its sweet time to drag itself to the horror content, but if you can hang on through the slow, character-building first episode, \"Bag of Bones\" is a dark and heartfelt ghost story."
B006I0GSZM First, it should be mentioned that I am a Stephen King fan. As far as I know, I've read all of his books, and \"Bag of Bones\" was one of my favorites. I loved everything about it- the summer Maine setting, the characters, and the \"traditional\" ghost story setup. It would be unreasonable to expect every detail of the novel to be crammed into a two episode TV mini-series. Instead, the producers did a great job of cutting where they had to, making small changes where necessary, but mostly retaining the story and the FEEL of King's \"Bag of Bones\". Be warned that it can (and will) get cheesy at times, but that's part of the charm.I watched this on rainy October evening, with a warm Labrador curled on my lap, a mug of hot chocolate near at hand. This was a great experience- nothing too mind blowing or horrific (I'm not a huge fan of horror movies); just a good, comfortable ghost story. It's mostly a harmless affair, with moderate amounts of tension (undoubtedly reduced since I had already read the novel) and no excess gore. Instead, the story revolves around psychological fear and exploration, with a solid performance turned in by Pierce Brosnan (King fans are lucky to have him on board for this TV adaptation). If you're fan of King's work, or ghost stories in general, grab a mug of hot chocolate on a cool fall evening, tune in, and enjoy."
B006I0GSZM Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense. They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided. They are separate stories that share a common bond. Example: I thought \"Help\" was better as a book (actually what my imagination created) than as a movie but the movie had it's acting strengths.As far as \"Bag of Bones\" it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes. Usual writer searching for inspiration; loses wife; goes to rural Maine (of course); encounters murder mysteries; has dreams; has romantic affair; things turn inexplicably on and off; windows/doors/drawers open & close; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret; spirits appear; spirits lose power when dug up. Help! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations. CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring. Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk (cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched, finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer (the trees in \"Alice...\" and in \"Wizard of Oz\" were scarier)."
B006I0GSZM Fantastic story line and great acting.  Several twists and turns with intrigue and horror to make you hang on to every moment.  If you haven't seen a movie that deals with a good mix of supernatural and reality, you don't want to miss this one."
B006I0GSZM It's been many years since I read Bag of Bones, so I don't know if I'd be nitpicking the details of this movie more if I'd read the book more recently, but I thought it was solid.  Like most TV movies, some of the acting was really good, and some not so much.  Pierce Brosnan as Mike Noonan was a highlight.  He's one of the most accomplished actors to take a lead role in a Stephen King adaptation, and he didn't take it lightly.  Many actors struggle at being believable in a supernatural tale, but I thought Brosnan came off as genuine in every scene where he interacted with the forces around Dark Score Lake.  He also did great expressing Mike's grief in the first part, showing that he still has formidable dramatic talent.  Being a longtime fan of King, I can't help but think it's incredibly cool that a former James Bond played a Stephen King character.  I'm sure King didn't mind it too much, either.  Out of the other important characters, I thought Max Devore was done well, and the girl who played Kyra did an excellent job.  Mattie, Sarah Tidwell, and Jo were passable, and most of the secondary characters, like Bill Dean and the housekeeper, were fine.  Lowlights for me were Mrs. Devore, who was cartoonish, and the officer who harasses Mike. Like I said, though, you can't usually expect an all-star ensemble when it's made for TV.  On that point, some of the special effects aren't so special with the TV budget, but some of it was actually quite good, particularly a couple of gruesome death scenes and some zombie-esque ghosts.  This movie also has several old-school horror \"jump\" moments that are effective at startling the hell out of you even though you know something is about to happen. All in all, I've seen worse Mick Garris-directed films, and maybe only a couple that are better.  Brosnan carries the cast, and the source material is strong enough to make for an entertaining 2 and 1/2+ hours.  It felt to me by the end that I had experienced something close to a novel, with enough mystery, drama, and suspense to keep my full attention.  I'd give it a solid B."
B006I0GSZM Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series."
B006I0GSZM Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include \"The Stand\" and the much maligned \"The Shining\" miniseries. For me, \"Bag of Bones\" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and/or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two-part miniseries may be a little off-putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in \"Bag of Bones\" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived-in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of \"Bag of Bones\" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel--but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze-fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!). KGHarris, 12/11."
B006I0GSZM I love Pierce Brosnan so this show was a shoe-in for me to begin with.  Though it used a lot of cliche scary effects, it had an net resting enough plot to keep me intrigued."
B006I0GSZM This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
B006I0GSZM I have always loved the imagination of Stephen King and this series on A&E; called the \"Bag of Bones\" relates to what I had been through with the loss of the only man I have ever loved.  The thinking they are there in a room with you or they have sent you a sign telling you how to handle their passing.  Pierce Bronson is perfect in the role and the rest of cast was chosen well.  That is one thing I like about Stephen King he does not let Hollywood or Television change his stories they are just like the books he writes.  Wonderful Series and I intend to buy it to see them all on my laptop to know how it ends is what makes King a great writer, as you never know how he will end his stories.  Great work this series is by a wonderful writer of so much that a world enjoys the challenge of how the story proceeds and ends.  Thank you Amazon for giving this to your customers to enjoy....Link to Bag of Bones Series -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006I0GSZM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
B006I0GSZM It's what I'd watch when there was nothing else at all and I had gone through all my DVDs and feel like &#34;well, that was OK&#34;"
B006I0GSZM Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either."
B006I0GSZM This is how I choose movies from the Roku my husband got for his birthday from my daughter.  It was a tense and unsettling to watch and a satisfying end.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I waited too long to write this and think I would remember it better if it were 5 star material.  Still think I'll be watching it again, which is a good test of the experience."
B006I0GSZM The story was a bit contrived but the acting excellent.  Always a surprise ending with Stephen King who leaves you hanging until the last."
B006I0GSZM Pierce Bronson plays Michael Noonan, a New England author, in a continuing of Stephen King's write about things you are series. When is wife, who he truly loved, dies, he is drawn to their lake home. Noonan has nightmares about his wife in the final scene of \"Quarantine\". At the lake home he inadvertently gets involved in a local drama and discovers some small town secrets that frankly would make a good novel, which BTW he has to write.I enjoyed the simple ghostly images and hauntings. Noonan takes the paranormal in stride as he tries to uncover more about the illness known as Dark Score Crazy which causes people to drown their daughters. What is unfortunate is any Stephen King fan can watch the film and see where the master has done this before. For instance when we see the computer screen with the same line written over and over, one can not help think about \"The Shining.\" The question begs: Does King want us to think about \"The Shining\" and give us a clue that Noonan is crazy or is it a deliberate misdirection? Or maybe King is starting to recycle old trunk novels as does the writer in the story. Outside of Noonan, the characters were poorly developed, especially considering the length of the film.While I enjoyed the film, I have come to expect more from Stephen King.Made for TV. Includes a rape scene."
B006I0GSZM I enjoyed watching this mini-series duo of broadcasts. The acting is good. Brosnan is convincing as the main character. There are some odd situations, but the plot carries you along most of the time. Since there are only 2 episodes to this series, the viewer is quickly pushed to the main character's situations. It would have been nice to have 2 more episodes or more to flesh out settings and characters. The topping to this is a classic Stephen King ending... you'll know it when you see it."
B006I0GSZM That's about it.  He is engaging, but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline, violence, and other characters.  Too bad.  I am sure the book was better; I read it some time ago, since I always read King's work."
B006I0GSZM Adapting a Stephen King novel to the screen has proved to be a dicey proposition for writers/directors in the past.  Either the film is a huge hit (like \"Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Green Mile\"), or it turns into a B-movie that doesn't nearly live up to the billing.  In the case of \"Bag of Bones\", director Mick Garris does a remarkable job of translating the page to the screen.For a basic plot summary, \"Bag of Bones\" sees writer Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) struggling with severe writers block after the death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish).  To try and break out of his funk, Mike heads to his summer retreat home on Dark Score lake, where Jo had frequented often.  While there, Mike meets Mattie Devore (Melissa George) and her daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael), who draw him into a haunting (literally!) mystery surrounding town baron Max Devore (William Schallert) & the unexplained death of 1930s jazz songstress Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose).What makes \"Bag of Bones\" really work is the fact that it doesn't stray too much from the original King subject matter.  It had been awhile since I read the novel, so I can't nit-pick all that much, but the film seemed to do a good job of sticking to the script, so to speak, and not deviate from King's wonderfully compelling (and spooky) tale.The acting, for the most part, is also quite fine.  Brosnan is very capable as the lead, while only a couple of the key auxiliary roles are sub-par.  Special credit needs to be given to little Ms. Carmichael, who really gives the show its emotional kick throughout.About the only thing this film doesn't translate well from the book are the \"villain\" characters (you'll know who they are after you watch).  In the book, I seem to remember much more character development about them, which was excised from this adaptation likely due to time.  It shows a bit in the end, when t
B006LG7IJ8 What I love about this show is there isn't one second that isn't outright silliness.There is so much comedic creativity here. The two lead characters even do gender reversals with the woman dressed as a man with his girlfriend in her red wig played by the man. And they do it so well including the voices, that it's easy to forget who is whom and just laugh.The people are all whacky, the situations are all outlandish, and the entire city apparently is off kilter. I can't wait to go there after watching this. While this is extreme craziness I do feel that there is a lot of truth here about how Portland actually is after knowing some charming delightful people from there. I was wondering if it was just this particular group of friends that seemed funnier than people I know on the east coast or what but now I'm thinking it's a funny place in general.This show keeps the spacey hipster goofiness coming at you non stop. It seems like the initial burst of steam the first season displayed has quieted down several notches.It's still funny but not hilareous like it was. And what makes it so special is it seems to frequently feature situations we are all familiar with. Waiting in line for hours at a popular restaurant for a table, overeager parents of a preschooler trying desperately to get their boy into the right preschool, the child hearing his parents making funny sounds in the bedroom, are some of the episodes.This show is more creative than most things out there and is a breath of fresh air. Not many shows make me smile and laugh any more but this one lightens my mood better than any."
B006LG7IJ8 I was hesitant about this show. I am not sure why, but I put off trying it for a long time. Then I heard some interviews with Carrie Brownstein and she seemed like an interesting and intelligent person so I decided to watch the first season. I liked it, but I was not blown away. At some point in the second season that changed. I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed in my entire life at some of the sketches in this second season. I was actually in physical pain from laughing at some of the sketches. That is when I knew I was a convert.The writing on the show is excellent and very consistent. Obviously, some sketches are funnier than others, but the percentage of really funny sketches on this show is, I think, higher than any other sketch show I have ever watched. I have also come to really love the recurring characters. I think that is part of the reason I liked the second season better than the first. It took a little while for some of the characters to grow on me, and I think it took me a little while to really figure out the sensibility of the show, but now that I have figured out the sensibility, and gotten to know the characters, it has really become one of my favorite shows.Fred and Carrie are also really good comic actors. That is probably no surprise with Fred since he has been a staple cast member on Saturday Night Live for ten years, but it is amazing to me what a great comic actor Carrie is. She delivers her lines perfectly. Some of the humor in this show can be subtle. Some of it is not subtle at all. But a lot of it is the kind of comedy that would not necessarily crack you up on the page, but delivered correctly it is genius, and Fred and Carrie always deliver it beautifully.The whole show just has a really great feel. Every sketch feels like the kind of thing that you come up with when you are sitting around with your friends and someone says something funny, or introduces some funny premise, and then someone else takes it further, and someone else takes it further, and so on, until everyone is laughing so hard they can barely stand it. Watching this show is like that. The show really feels like it is just friends having fun and it seems, from the interviews I have seen with Fred and Carrie, like that is an accurate account of how this show came into being. I think that whole sensibility carries over into the show and makes it a really enjoyable viewing experience.There is one sketch from this season that I have to single out. It was the sketch where a bunch of kids are at a museum and Fred and Carrie are playing Lewis and Clark. I don't know what it was about that sketch. It is a really weird sketch in some ways, but I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed harder at that sketch than I have ever laughed at anything in my life (\"I don't know why you're running!...They are still running...\") Any show that can take such a weird, silly, premise, and make me laugh that hard, deserves my absolute seal of approval. If you have been hesitant about this show, as I was, I recommend giving it a try as soon as possible."
B006LG7IJ8 Penny Marshall guest starred in this show. The small part was perfect for her. Portlandia is not for everyone, the humor is a acquired taste but I enjoy the quirkiness of the characters."
B006LG7IJ8 The humor is clever but not funny for me personally. I get it but a big &#34;so what&#34; in my way of being. I prefer comedy which has me laughing out loud some of the time and holds my interest."
B006LG7IJ8 I used to live in Portland, kind of get the self-conscious posturing of Portland denizens; kind of phony, but at heart sincere and well-intentioned. Carrie and Fred have nailed the lifestyle-I remember waiting in line for an hour for famous pancakes that supposed to be organic, natural and healthy, but were as dense as corrugated iron. Enjoy the easy-going spoofing and seeing the sites of Portland-it really is a beautiful place."
B006LG7IJ8 I love these crazy actors! they'll do anything for a laugh, the impersonations of the west coast portlandereeer's is extremely funny!"
B006LG7IJ8 In their continued, playful lambasting of hipsters, progressives, and weirdos of Portland (not to mention their smaller sister of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, ahem), Carrie and Fred do a marvelous job of bringing fresh fun to sketch comedy. Not only can they pickle eggs, cucumbers, and assorted inedible objects, they can also give just about any concept their funky \"pickling\" treatment.The chemistry between these two is downright magical, and the variations in the identities they assume is stunning. You always know that it's Fred and Carrie (obviously), but the transformation in their delivery and personality as they change roles is fascinating to watch, along with the mostly subtle visual changes (like Fred's awesome selection of wigs).Favorite moments from Season Two include Andy Samberg starring as a mixologist in one episode, Fred and Carrie attempting to take over the role of Portland law enforcement, and the induction of Kevin into the band \"Cat Nap\". Looking forward to Season Three!"
B006LG7IJ8 As a Portland resident, I'll admit that it's nice to see the town in high-quality photography, and I'll agree that most of the caricatures are quite spot on. However, I've never been a great fan of the show for a couple reasons. One is that the same ideas are milked over and over, often using the same characters, with no new ground being broken. The feminist bookstore is probably the best example: Each successive skit in that setting seems to be just a variation on the original idea, without reaching for additional substance or a new perspective. Another problem is that Armisen and especially Brownstein seem to equate inarticulate mugging with comedy. This just in: They're not the same thing. Sputtering your lines, raising your eyebrows or tossing objects is no substitute for true humor. There are some skits that are nice in the way that a short poem is, and of all the routines in this season I think the Battlestar Galactica one is truly inspired, though it does go on a little too long in the middle. This series is adequately diverting most of the time, but it's hardly as good as it thinks it is. Still, I'll keep watching in hopes of someday seeing Union Station in high definition...."
B006LG7IJ8 By this season they were like 50's jazz at Birdland.  If one player ever became predictable, others would counter or shift it.  Every episode is a mini Christopher Guest movie...which means exaggerated silly and absurd behavior from characters who often lack self awareness.  The \"Catnapped\" episode may even be funnier than the Sarah Silverman Program's \"Tab\" episode or Eastbound and Down's \"Cookout\" episode."
B006LG7IJ8 This show twerks the quirk. What can I say, it's so strange that I love it. It reminds me of that stuck-up boyfriend I had that always went on and on about &#34;PORTLAND is so GREAT because..... &#34; with his nose in the air. He was such a tool. I sincerely hope he moved there and drowned in a craft beer. Ugh. Anyway, unlike Jeremy, this show was cool. The city seems to be a lot like East Nashville- kind of insufferable, but adorable, in the way a small, confused child is when they're constantly running after shiny new toys and getting obsessed with every new fad they see.God I love this show. I guess I'm kind of like the people on it, which is why I really hate it so much. I'm so confused. Inside every hipster is a lot of self-loathing, mixed with an equal amount of self-importance. I'm so confused. Great show, though!"
B006LG7IJ8 Porlandia and its inhabitants will be familiar to anyone who practices green ethics, shops at the coop and is generally left of center (and proud of it!).  Hipsters, old hippies, overly involved parents and trendiness are all given a wonderful satirical going over in this show.  My personal favorite...\"Gotta get the Gear\"..... since I definitely buy too much junk when I get into a hobby.  You do not have to live in Portland to enjoy this...Eugene, Davis, Eureka or any of the other small cities that are inhabited by us greensters will do.  I laugh at each episode and recognize myself in the sends ups.  Good fun.  Well I am off to REI and Trader Joe's cause I gotta get the gear."
B006LWHBDA I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.  It is okay for some people; there are better things to watch for entertainment.  My husband watches this stuff.  It is a waste of my money and my time.  Somethings shouldn't be aired more than once or twice and this is one of them."
B006LWHBDA Fun show to watch for quick laughs, it's not &#34; Under The Dome &#34; it's like a 30 Min. sitcom but some funny characters to say the least."
B006LWHBDA Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper."
B006LWHBDA I liked this season better than the others do far. Only a few into it but the players are comical"
B006LWHBDA I buy auction units in Southern California in Dotson territory.  These guys are really nice and make the auctions fun.  My issue is the California show has run the price of the units sky high.  My wife and I will watch the show and say what we would pay for the auctions in question.  We always seem to be to low for California but right on for Texas.  The characters in this show are good and the merchandise that is won is pretty interesting.  I would like to go to Texas to go to one of these auctions just based on this show.  It is fun to watch and it is a good time.  Watch it, you wont be disappointed."
B006LWHBDA I believe a lot of these shows are fake, meaning that the situations are scripted and the valuable items are strategically placed.  Whatever.  Even if this show is like that (and, I'm not sure if it is or not), I watch these shows to learn about antiques and collectibles.  This show has that!  They buy some cool stuff and I'm learning about different items and what their value might be. Don't watch it to critique the reality of the episodes.  Watch it to learn and see some cool stuff coming out of the storage lockers!"
B006LWHBDA This first season is 6 shows long and that's really short for a show. I have seen the first 4 shows so far and that's like almost the whole season. lolSo far, I thought this show was exactly like the original Storage Wars show. Everything seems the same, but the people on it. I believe the people on the original show is much better. They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show."
B006LWHBDA I love watching this show and seeing what treasures are found. I'm addicted and will watch to the very end."
B006LYWJR6 Muriel who lived in a small oceanside town dreamed of being happy. She wanted to be loved and wanted friends who really were her friends. She was a simple girl who really didn't seem to understand the way the world worked. Her father was a brow beater who's never ending diatribe of how awful and unworthy his children and spouse were in his eyes didn't help her self esteem much. She made rash decisions that were mostly poor ones. However, in the end she did manage to figure it all out with the help of a devoted friend. Her unorthodox wedding to a high stakes athlete was a mistake that proved both good and bad for the girl. While navigating the treacherous friendships that were superficial at best and short lived with girls who found the only thing important in life was status she found herself. It was hard and it was heartbreaking but it was funny as well. This movie was unique and the music was of course awesome! Who doesn't love ABBA?"
B006LYWJR6 An Australian chubby girl who dreams constantly of her wedding and the tricks and subterfuge so she was involved in in trying to reach her goal. A thoroughly dysfunctional family is of no help."
B006LYWJR6 This was an odd movie, off beat to say the least, but it hooked you in so that you wanted to see what was finally going to happen, as Muriel's character developed.  The ending was worth the wait"
B006LYWJR6 Ok, first time I watched this I was like wtf? A month later I came across it again and this movie really grew on me.1. The cast is all relateable in some way, if that's not enough the humour and accents are enjoyable on their own2. The plot moves a little slowly at times, but it makes up for it in the more dramatic scenes that lead up to/ after them3. It
B006LYWJR6 \"Muriel's Wedding\" is the Majority of Girls thinking, when you are NOT the Popular Snob in School, Family or Work.  Oh, but there is payback for those, who think they are better than everyone else.  When you come out behind that shy timid girl and have grown into a beautiful butterfly that attracts men like bears to honey.  I was like Muriel when I was 14 and oh the first class reunion, the night clubs that I was the one to know to get into, and the boys, who thought they were too good for me.  Payback can be fun and that is just what I did, they asked me to dance and I had a guy far better in looks, manners and personality, so I said, \"No thanks I am with someone\".  To every wall flower and shy timid girl there is a day you will turn into that butterfly and enjoy it, as long as you can.  You see you always were someone and now they know it, as well as you do.  You are the dancing queen the one, who makes all of them jealous.  Be proud of who you have become, because you are a special person and never forget it my friends.  Toni Collette, as Muriel the bride was great, she played the girl, who was shy and timid and wants to be like the popular girls, who do not want her hanging around with them.  While Muriel goes on a vacation she meets a old high school friend named Rhonda, played by Rachel Griffiths, Bill Hunter is Muriel's Father Bill a critic of every single person in the family from his wife, to all 6 children and shows how he is having a fling with another woman.  The ending is great and the story fits 80% of the women in our world, who have not become that butterfly, who spreads her wings and takes off for better places.  Muriel does and finds herself to become the person she was meant to be and tells her father that \"NO, I am not going to come back home and take care of your children, you take care of them I am going back to Sydney!\"  She does so bringing Rhonda with her and that is how the movie ends.  It is a Great Comedy, Wonderful singing by Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths doing an ABBA number and dancing to the music as they sing on stage.Below is the link that every girl and woman should watch on a Friday or Saturday and thank yourselves for finding, who you really are:B006LYWJR6"
B006LYWJR6 A-W-E-S-O-M-E! If you're ever having an OFF day.  This is your ticket to BLISS.  Five star and for good reason.  It helps you learn, laugh and want to dance while gleefully saying I'm #1. I'M #1. Because you really are."
B006LYWJR6 I noticed that this, one of my top 25 favorite movies, was available for streaming with Prime, and read some of the reviews.  I was floored to see some of the poor reviews.  Not that it must be everybody's cup of tea, but how is it people can watch and not have a CLUE what it's about?  Minor spoilers as to themes follow.Yes, it's offbeat.  Yes, it's told in an unusual way.  The old adage \"Show, don't tell\" is followed throughout, and perfectly so.  But for goodness sake- isn't the time spent viewing a movie worth a little reflection on its meaning?  The absurd events of Muriel's life mirror the absurdity of life writ large.  The movie's about a young woman who wants desperately to BE somebody.  She's shy, awkward, weird, doesn't know how to behave, inevitably says and does the wrong thing.  The in-crowd shuns her, and still she tries to gain acceptance.  Those efforts are demonstrated against the backdrop of relations with her dysfunctional family of misfits.  She resents and yet is an amalgam of her parents- her mother, fat, insecure and self-loathing, her father, a grandiose liar who will go to any dishonest lengths to seem important, make the news, garner attention by any means possible (he's a politician).  The mother just wants to be valued by her husband and children, to no avail.  Muriel's younger siblings are even more pathetic than she, and actually look to hapless Muriel for inspiration and guidance.  Oh my.The movie is about Muriel's quest to find out who she is and find meaning in life, the Holy Grail of quests (though not necessarily her realized goal- at first she just wants to LIVE).  She tries various desperate things, some inspired by her parents' behavior and values (I won't list them), but the biggie is finding a husband and having a fancy wedding, however possible, by hook or by crook- THAT will show everybody.  She gets herself into trouble ever more deep.  In the midst of all this, she meets an old school chum, someone slightly more evolved, who doesn't care WHAT other people think (the fabulous Rachel Griffiths).  Griffiths becomes a friend and role model, has an effect most profound on Muriel.  They get an apartment together, and Muriel just begins to spread her wings- and tragedy hits.This movie is all about life, fraught with disappointments, unkind people, and misfortunes foreseeable and unforeseeable (and yet- there are other ways to look at it).  It's about seeing yourself anew, taking the blinders off.  It's about the myriad ways we delude ourselves, inventing things to value and feel good about- often valuing style and mere appearance over substance and character.  It's about longing to change, to be your own person, to be a person of integrity, instead of a colossal screw-up.  And parenthetically, what is integrity?  So few people exhibit it.  And yet, it's everything, the most essential thing- without it you've got nothing.  And finally, it's about what it truly means to love other people.  Or so say I, anyway- these were some of the things I came away with.Come to think of it, these are some of the themes of another wonderful Toni Collette film (an adult drama), made a few years later,Japanese Story.This sounds like solemn stuff indeed, but it's not, that's what's so wonderful- the reality seeps into your emotional pores through osmosis, themes reverberate between a series of intriguing, memorable scenes, some funny, some ridiculous, some tragic (e.g., her mother's clothesline in the back yard.)  No-one hits you over the head with anything, you figure it out for yourself.  The ending of this movie is one of my favorite film endings ever- things look pretty bad, how could they get any worse?  But DON'T count this fat, pathetic loser out YET.The triumphant scene where the cabdriver throws opens the cab door, with ABBA playing, is one of those quintessential, iconic movie moments that etches itself into your very psyche: \"Leave 'em burning and then you're gone...\"  I saw this in a large theater when it came out, and it got a standing ovation.  If you don't like this, or at least appreciate the themes, you must be made of wood.  This movie made marvels Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths international stars, and rightly so.  BRAVO."
B006LZSF8M If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more."
B006LZSF8M i really don't believe that an all veggie diet is the way to go but these people are convinced. Just buy responsible so you know what your getting"
B006LZSF8M This movie is a must watch, along with the movie chow down. People, we are killing ourselves with what we eat. Go back to nature and live to be healthy and old. It teaches you how to spend as much time on earth as taught in the bible."
B006LZSF8M No hard sell on going vegan. I was open to going vegan but the film affirmed my view that vegans are so disgusted with factory farming that  they opt out all together. The film on cruely and animal abuse in factory farming, which they showed to their three New Yorkers  , willing to give it a try,  seemed to have the biggest effect.They were traumatised . As most americans would be if they chose not to turn a blind eye or were exposed to the sickening cruelty as suppressed by corporate interests.However it encouraged me to investigate if cage free eggs were more humane or Perdue chickens and their not. So the film 's a reminder to those of us trying to do the right thing and be more vigilant in sourcing animal food/ products farmed humanely.I think a film on changing diet to be more vetarian with a little/less meat and where to find it and being sure to verify pervasive fraudulant claims ( that are somehow still legal) is more useful.  Whatever- this over-comsumption of meat and dairy within the last century  is not sustainable enviromentally or in health costs; we need more films to make the transition than turn vegan. I did not feel it was very representative that 2 out of 3 of the film's guinia-pigs were  persuaded to turn vegan in the end."
B006LZSF8M This is an excellent film about three carnivorous New Yorker's who give veganism a try - and like it (more or less). It is pretty humorous until they get to the animals-in-industrialized-hell footage, then it's hard to stop weeping (or maybe that's just me). I highly recommend this film."
B006LZSF8M This was ok but the story development seemed disjointed. I hoped to really learn more about vegetarianism, benefits, outcomes, etc. and just got more reality TV."
B006LZSF8M First up, I've been a vegan for nearly a year and I can attest to the transformational effects it has on your health, fitness, attitude and lifestyle. I've been a single-person marketing campaign for films such as Forks Over Knives and Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, both of which illustrate effectively the positive effects of a plant-based diet (beer is plant based, woo-hoo). Personally, I think the biggest negative of veganism is the stereotyped baggage that follows which I try to fight all the time - vegetable eaters aren't all smoking weed in their drum circles trying to fight the man.While I support any effort to show people how the Western diet is bad for your health, this film comes across as more of a PETA commercial than an attempt to follow 3 people willfully changing their lifestyle. I'm completely against the way that mass farm treats animals but spreading the vegan word must surely come from illustrating the gains that individuals make rather than having a political agenda about animal treatment. That said, what is shown in the film in the animal processing facilities is disturbing and the public should be aware - but let's make that a focus of a different film.For me, this film lacked the journey promised in the subtitle about following 3 New Yorkers becoming vegan which could have been funny, personal, touching and dramatic. As a contrast, I think Forks Over Knives is a substantially more approachable film for non-vegans and doesn't press the animal cruelty buttons to guilt people into quitting hamburgers."
B006LZSF8M Real people and real life circumstances made this documentary very easy to watch and understand. It was well constructed and kept me very interested in watching it. I learned a lot too."
B006LZSF8M This film approaches American Agriculture and diet lifestyle from the perspectives of three citizens who are newly educated about the film's topics and ideas. Their reactions and changed lifestyles are the convincing themes of the documentary. Very different from the other films on this thread, this is one for those who don't like to watch documentaries.There's no question that the film both educates and entertains, albeit with moments passed cringing in reaction to what  the daily, ordinary behaviors of American agriculture are."
B006LZSF8M This film really opens your eyes.  I didn't realize just how badly many animals are treated.  It was interesting but there was a little bit of language.  My family has been vegetarian on and off but now we are going vegan between inhumane practices (even with organic farms!) and other health concerns I think we need this."
B006LZSF8M I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they \"discover\". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read \"Diet For a New America\" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was \"become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer\".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them. It wasn't what I thought, and I don't want that message forced down my throat. I'd rather watch \"Food, Inc.\" I thought it was a million times better than this."
B006LZSF8M This film's goal is to educate you as to the health benefits of a vegan, or at least vegetarian lifestyle, but even more, it is dedicated to educating people as to the horrible atrocities committed to fill the shelves in the meat section of your local grocer. It basically takes three people from different lifestyles and challenges them to embrace a vegan lifestyle for six weeks. During those six weeks, as they are learning how they can eat properly without meat or dairy products, they are also exposed to the dark underbelly of animal butchery and production. The film is very graphic in this respect, showing the inside of chicken, beef, and pork production plants and farms. One scene shows the castration of a cow. Very disturbing. The film also teaches about how, just because a label says free range, organic, and cruelty free, it doesnt really actually meet those standards. For example, when we see 'free range', i think we all have a picture of an animal traipsing about a meadow until it's slaughter time (which is gruesome enough). In reality, they are still kept in small pens and squalid conditions, but are simply not confined 12 chickens to a single tiny cage. They show how chicken beaks are melted off to keep them from fighting in the cages. They show a lot. In fact, if you were to watch this film, i think you might view the consumption of meat and dairy quite differently, from both an appeal standpoint, and also from an ethical one.There is some sloppy editing in this film, including at least one glaringly obvious misspelling, but t
B006LZSF8M The trials and tribulations of neophyte vegans.  Interesting but not inspiring, at least not to me.  It may be noble to be vegan but the film lacked energy."
B006LZSF8M So enlightening about the sources of our food and what is actually nutritious.  Of course, I worked for a meat packer and was steered away from the slaughter floor several decades ago, but somehow it just seemed necessary.  Older is wiser and a revisit to the scene makes me question what I eat though years ago I reduced serving sizes and use some vegetable protein in cooking I was still eating fish, eggs, milk products etc.  Well produced to direct you to thinking about what you are putting in your body at who's expense.  Watch it with your kids.  Definitely more important than gun control and can save your life."
B006NU7C48 I'd not seen any episodes for several years.  I have seen Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, and Julia Sawalha in many other projects and always enjoy their work so figured since I had the chance would watch some f these episodes.  I admit, it takes a few minutes to get into &#34;the grove&#34; of the shows.  Once pulled in they are hilarious. For a real treat check out season 6 episodes also."
B006NU7C48 After her daughter having a baby, I wondered where this show would go, but this episode was SO FUNNY that I had to consciously not howl out loud! So glad I kept on watching it!!!"
B006NU7C48 I often as I watch this I never grow tired of it. May be we all need a moment of fabulousness"
B006NU7C48 I used to watch this show a while ago, the first two seasons.  Viewing it as a therapist, it is a sad show and not really that funny."
B006NU7C48 These ladies are priceless!  Their antics remind one of middle school girls with addiction issues .  You could definitely binge watch these episodes..."
B006NU7C48 I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff"
B006NU7C48 I love this show. So funny! My favorite British comedians. The writers are amazing and this is one of my favorite series"
B006NU7C48 Eddy & Pats are my idea of the perfect pair. They remind me that no matter how corrupt and decadent you are, you can still be hilarious"
B006NU7C48 I love british humor and this is wonderful!!!!  I have actually watched all of the seasons several times and I never tire of them"
B006NU7C48 The show like the other seasons are very, very, entertaining. I love the characters and they played they roles very convincingly."
B006NU7C48 Lotsa fun.  Reminds me of my own selfish flippy-dippy hippie youth.  So refreshing to see ladies who know how to have a good time and are not constantly yammering on about their tedious tots and the tubby hubby.  Martha Stewart would be pitched into the Thames without ceremony.  No white sale at Penney's here.  Highly recommended."
B006NU7C48 This is still one of the funniest but most irreverent comedies ever made for television.  Jennifer Saunders writing and her performance as well as that of Joanna Lumley are simply priceless in their depiction of a pair of aging, vain, shallow, self-absorbed boomers who are wealthy enough to get into plenty of trouble but still envious of those with more.  The perpetual social climbing, lubricated by more than ample alcohol, and peppered with hilarious unbridled condescension (and sometimes outright bigotry) skewers the former Sloane Rangers more pointedly than any other satire of the era.Don't start watching this series without beginning at the beginning.  It is necessary to see the whole series to understand the preposterously endearing relationship between these two aging relics and truly enjoy the humor."
B006O2WRHM My two year old loves gabba. Loves gabba. We watch an episode every single day. The songs get stuck in my head but they are catchy. As an adult I like the guest stars and the bands they have on the show. I also like how the lessons teach proper social behavior and norms, like sharing and not biting people."
B006O2WRHM We have all the seasons so we had to purchase this one as well. Unfortunately it has much fewer episodes than the other seasons. My daughter's favorites are Farm and Gooble. I found myself enjoying the Farm episode myself, and my daughter loves me to sing the garden song to her as a lullaby. Super Music Friends Show is her favorite part of the whole show. No matter what she's doing she always gets up to dance. I think it's super cute and fun, and less annoying for adults than many kid's shows."
B006O2WRHM My 2 year old son has been watching Yo Gabba Gabba since he was 4 months old. Yes, he actually watched it. The music kept him happy when he was very young. He still watches it to this day. He sings the songs, dances with them and everything else. It's one of the lesser evils on TV for kids (my personal opinion)."
B006O2WRHM Our girls love this show, and all the toys. Our girls watch the typical cartoons, like Disney toons, Dora, etc. - but YGG gets them up and DANCING. This show is great!"
B006O2WRHM I did not like Gabba Gabba at first. It was not like the shows I watched as a kid, but none are these days. I'm 65 and Ding Dong School and the old Mickey Mouse club. But my 2 year old granddaughter loves this show. She sings the songs and loves the dancy dance time and follows the story lines. The characters are much like their counterpart human children and the kids seem to get this. It will not bother me to see Ruby talking with nostalgia about this show when she is in her 20s."
B006O2WRHM When I first saw this show I was like nope. After watching it a couple more times I saw the good message it sent & my daughter loves to dance & sing a long!"
B006O2WRHM My daughter's favorite show. This episode is cool. I wish they'd film new episodes, but the episode with Jack Black is definitely our favorite."
B006O2WRHM My two year old freezes in place when we put yo gaba gaba on. Then he mimics DJ Lance's dance moves. Great show!"
B006O2WRHM My child will watch anything YGG.But, Tori Spelling - pregnant - with tunic riding up in back?That's worse than getting hit in the face with a snowball.Every time I see the show, I know behind it all, there aredads laughing.Leslie and Tori, we can tell you were dressed bymen cutting fabric with safety scissors, who let their daughtersdo your makeup. But have some pride ladies,little girls are watching!"
B006O2WRHM My Autistic son doesn't have very many favorite shows but this is one of them by far.  He even has tablet games related to the show."
B006O2WRHM As a grown-up , I am not quite sure I appreciate this show but the kids love it...especially the 3 to 6 year olds. The message of the show is positive and encouraging of diversity. It can get a bit silly but it is definitely a feel good experien
B006O3Z39U Ghost Hunters started very modestly but has become something of a showhorse. The exit of the humble Grant Wilson was a foreboding of a slicker production lead by Grant's less humble buddy, Jason Hawes. the strange hirings and firings of last season break open with a new season of celebrity guest stars and questionable evidence. Ghost hunters must be credited, though with the current interest and methods of paranormal investigation copied by so many others."
B006O3Z39U This is a series my wife and I find irresistible.  We have never been disappointed.  If someone would reply letting me know why the recent seasons aren't available with Roku (or other devices), I would greatly appreciate it!"
B006O3Z39U Will always enjoy GH. Their travels take them places that I would never have considered and the investigation finds along the way make it an enjoyable program."
B006O3Z39U I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough. Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality. This episode was no exception. I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason. When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light. With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything. It use to be personable and watchable, now it's just a joke. They 'jumped the shark' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog. Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings!"
B006O3Z39U I love this show. It is absolutely my favorite show on tv. BUT, WHERE IS IT!!!!!!! I love the show. I love the people, their interaction with each other and the spirits. I absolutely believe this is a credible show and that what they are doing is real. I love the technology that they use and their professionalism and competence. And I think this next season is going to be one of the best, but I can't find it. I was in the middle of purchasing whole seasons and poof gone. Help me tell syfy that people are cutting the cable cord and need Amazon to have access to this. I'm sure they would make more money by people buying seasons than paying cable. This is a great show you learn allot and get real thrills unlike with sparkly vampires or gruesome not got to watch movies!!!"
B006O3Z39U I was worried that Ghost Hunters would not be as entertaining anymore without Grant but I was wrong.  If anything, the newer shows are even more chilling.  Of course, that is no reflection on Grant and I do miss him."
B006O3Z39U Just good old ghost hunting at its best . I think ghost hunting should be about gathering evidence of the paranormal. Not so much entertaining the audience but rather explaining the how and why ghost are there and trying to prove it."
B006O3Z39U Steve and Tango still my favorites. They make ghost hunting fun."
B006O3Z39U This season was good. I have watched almost every season from the beginning.I hope they keep that new investigator(not Michelle but the other one) She seemed down to earth and relaxed. She wasn't trying to show off or anything. I hope they bring her back. Michelle lied on the Acadamy. She was not a good investigator, She just seems like she doesn't want to be there. Adam however blew me away. Adam was a great choice. I love Adam and Amy. Amy has really stood out since Kris left. I love watching Adam and Amy. They make a great team. As well as Britt and KJ. We will miss Grant, Steve and Dave are always fun. But Jason needs his buddy Grant. :("
B006O3Z39U I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked."
B006O3Z39U Another great list of investigations from the ghost hunter team, this time they go to more great places, and catch great evidence! I can't wait for part 2 to come out, i'll be glued to that dvd as well!"
B006O3Z39U I'm a Ghost Hunters junkie but do not have cable.  Getting this by instant video on Amazon is the best legal, way to keep my K2 meter flashing."
B006O3Z39U Not too bad an episode, wished they had gone over all the EVP's with the client they found. Still strange without Grant.. and not sure about Jason's very fast spoken commentary."
B006OU14BO better than a soap opera , and its real, kinda. its fun to watch tho. keep it coming... LOVE AMAZONNNNN"
B006OU14BO Where I live now there's very little going on, so this is great and fills a need to see people going through the grinds and joys of life together, even though these are some tough streetwise cookies. I guess that's what makes it fun."
B006OU14BO but it grasp my attention based on how they chose to live and the so call friends they surround themselves with ..."
B006OU14BO The crescendo for these women really takes off once Karen's father is ratted on by Junior and a line starts to be drawn against Carla for her instigating nature."
B006OU14BO Drama, fun, facts, friendship, style, a way of life all rolled into one. a new twist on an old story."
B006OU14BO Well people this is # 2 of a killer Italian girl bad asses show! I love these girls big time! Drama baby! Get it for your collection!"
B006OU14BO these ladies are as real as it gets and that's what I love about this show. this season was entertaining and full of drama, I can't wait to see season 3!!!"
B006OU14BO This was pretty good.  I hope that these women were hamming it up for the show because I can't really believe that grown women would act that way."
B006OU14BO Too much fighting, too much he say, she say. These are grown woman in their 40's. I can believe how they carry themselves. We all hate Karen and Ramona, these are terrible woman. Happy to know they will eventually be leaving the cast. We all like drama in a show but this is ridiculous from these very old woman."
B006OU14BO The women start to become friends, they are Clearly making money and you just know the other shoe is about to drop. Makes me want to do a show about my family"
B006RECSBC In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst."
B006RECSBC This is one \"horror\" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense 
B006RECSBC Ti West has done his monster / zombie film w/ THE ROOST, his satanic-panic film w/ HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, and now comes his ghost story w/ THE INNKEEPERS. This is another throwback to earlier, simpler times, when horror was built upon a firm foundation of ever-increasing dread. West captures the essence of the haunted inn, making the place itself a character, and not just a setting. The human characters are believable, the spectres are jolting, and the atmosphere grows thick w/ gloom and impending death. Don't go into INNKEEPERS expecting a HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL / 13 GHOSTS carnival ride. It's meant to get under your skin, not give you big, non-stop thrills..."
B006RECSBC I screened this film the other day and was totally surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.This movie is very funny and quirky, especially at the beginning.  As the film progresses it becomes more terrifying, but the director did a very good job of taking his time and building the suspense.  While watching, I actually started thinking about the whole \"found footage\" (FF) genre, if that is a genre.  Now, this is surely not of that genre, thank god.  I have to admit, if I see another FF movie I am going to, well, scream.  Not scream from fear but scream from boredom and pain.Probably the reason I thought of the whole FF genre:  the two main characters here - a guy and a gal who have temporarily taken over running a hotel just before it closes - have their own video cameras and equipment, and are trying to record evidence of a ghost in the hotel.  Now, Sara Paxton is very good here and very funny; and Pat Healy is excellent as well.  Even Kelly McGillis gives a nice performance as a, well, psychic, I guess.I guess the critics really liked this film but the average viewer did not.  I think that I know why.  This film plays it straight; it doesn't rely on some lame twisteroo at the end.  I liked that alot.  If you are a twisteroo fan - there are many of those out there and twist away - you probably won't like this film.  But for me, this was a very refreshing idea:  no twisteroos!  Whoda thunk it?A surprisingly big recommendation here."
B006RECSBC The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite t
B006RECSBC Ti West really is one of the best... He builds suspense so well, and with The Innkeepers the story cracks you up as much as it makes you crap your pants. I love this film... I saw The Conjuring last weekend and I could only compare that film to this... Same film making style... I feel like James Wan and Ti West are the only ones right now reading the same \"No Cheap Tricks\" horror playbook... Seriously, the best horror is like a good boxer, full of jabs, fake outs, and ultimate surprise KOs.P.S.I know you can stream this one on Netflix, but the two commentaries on the DVD are worth the price. They are really funny and insightful ... You really get the feeling that this cast and crew bonded while simultaneously getting cabin fever in the hotel while shooting."
B006RECSBC For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty-something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.  I just felt it wasn't that good even though I really, really wanted to like it."
B006RECSBC Movies revolving around the supernatural have always felt lacking. Of course, the most recent ones are mostly remakes so they already have an uphill battle ahead of them but there are very few movies featuring ghosts or the supernatural that I feel are worth mentioning in a conversation about great films. Ghostbusters, The Orphanage, The Shining, Shutter (the Thai original), The Ring, The Frighteners, and The Devil's Backbone are about it for me. It's a sub genre of horror that just hasn't meshed well with me over the years much like exorcism films. In the same breath, I still haven't been able to get a clear read on what I think of Ti West as a writer and a director. The House of the Devil was really disappointing. Its slow pace made the film seem practically uneventful and didn't really feel worthwhile in the long run. The Innkeepers has a similar pace as The House of the Devil yet feels slightly more methodical on West's part in comparison.Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) are the only two employees working during the final days of the Yankee Pedlar Inn. This hotel is rumored to be haunted by Madeline O' Malley, a woman who hung herself in her room after being stood up by her fianc&eacute; at the altar. Luke and Claire try to make contact with the paranormal through EVP recording devices in between watching the front desk and handling the few stragglers who come to stay during the hotel's final weekend of operation. Needless to say, Luke and Claire begin to see results as the guests at the hotel become a bit stranger.I'm surprised the score to The Innkeepers was as good as it was. It's a little bizarre to have such good things to say about movies coming out in between January and March since these are the months that studios decide to push whatever's been sitting on their shelf for a long period of time or release something they expect to do poorly at the box office. The score is really fantastic though, especially during the opening credits. It's usually very strings heavy and puts you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion. It helps add that extra bit of tension. At other times, a lack of music speaks volumes. The way the film encompasses the importance of sound into t
B006RECSBC Quaint, enchanting, cute - these aren't words normally associated with films about a haunting, but they are more than apt for describing The Innkeepers.  If you're wondering if this can even be considered a horror movie, I can assure you that it does earn its horror chops when all is said and done (although I think the trailer oversells the scare factor).  What I took away from the movie, though, was a rather poignant sense of melancholy.  You aren't going to find many horror films that run you through such a gamut of emotions as this one.  It's an unconventional but really impressive piece of work from writer/director Ti West.The setting is the historic Yankee Pedlar Inn, on the final weekend before it closes its doors forever.  With only one floor open and three rooms booked, young Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) are all the only employees left to see the inn through its final days and hours.  Their focus, however, is in trying to prove that the venerable old hotel is indeed haunted - supposedly by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a young bride who reportedly hanged herself when her lover abandoned her on her wedding day.  Luke has created a web site about sightings of the ghost, but it is Claire who seems fixated on making contact with Madeline before the inn closes its doors forever.  Claire is quite a character - young, unfocused, highly excitable, and just incredibly cute.  She definitely doesn't seem to have the temperament of a ghost hunter, as several comical scenes early on make clear.  Personally, I found her infatuating, and I thought Sara Paxton's portrayal of her was almost magical.  Kelly McGillis also turns in a strong performance as actress turned new age healer Leanne Rease-Jones, a character who comes to play a crucial and prophetic part in the story.The Innkeepers is devilishly hard to describe.  In a way, much of the story is predictable, yet at the same time it's also rather shocking in the end.  The writing is subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.  It sounds stupid for me to describe the story as both conventional and unconventional, but I think that is a true statement.  Those who like their scares blatant and numerous probably won't like the film, as it's really not a scarefest.  The Innkeepers is a ghost story in the traditional sense, full of subtle nuance and dare I say intellect, playing out in a little world where the characters are more important than the events that befall them.  I loved it."
B006RECSBC A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one-time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.The only other film I've seen from writer/director Ti West was \"The House of the Devil\" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the sto
B006RECSBC Ti West does it again with The Innkeepers. Just like his The House Of The Devil, he spends the first 2 acts building tension with mystery, intrigue and a bit of comedy, then slapping it on heavy in the third act with the reveal and real horror. The House Of The Devil was a throw back to 1980's occult horror, this movie is a throwback to classic films about haunted buildings, like The Shining. Sara Paxton pleasantly surprised me as charming, cute and funny in this movie and really carried the film. While this movie may be predictable like most movies about ghosts, there is a nice kind of twist at the end that weaves everything together well and If you aren't looking closely at the final shot, you may miss a very nice little treat. Way better than I expected it to be, especially since most horror movies are a let down. I should have known better because I thought The House Of The Devil was brilliant, and this movie is no exception. I thought this movie was great. On Blu-Ray it looks clean, crisp and sharp. There is no visible DNR, blacks are deep and there is visible film grain. There is also a little bit of specks on the film b
B006RECSBC The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door."
B006RECSBC I definitely think Ti West is one of the best directors working today after seeing this movie.I used to have mixed feelings about him before because I loved Trigger Man but hated House of the Devil and The Roost.  I thought Cabin Fever 2 was okay.The Innkeepers is just an excellent movie through and through, though it seems like nothing happens until the very end the build up is just as enjoyable.The fact that the characters are so likeable and so well developed makes what happens at the end so much scarier.Normally i hate ghost movies but this was just great.Sarah Paxton carries the movie almost entirely by herself and gives one of the best performances I have seen in any movie in years.This comes right after seeing her in Shark Night, a decent movie which is improved by her presence alone.From now on I will look forward to any movies that Ti West or Sarah Paxton do.The Innkeepers is brilliant."
B006RECSBC Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" is a tour de force, certainly superior to his debut \"House of the Devil\".  It seems to be a bit under appreciated judging by both the comments here and it's critical reception.  I'm not sure why.  It is a bit like peeling an onion but once you do, you don't cry--you scream.  This is psychological terror at it's most refined and disturbing.Sara Paxton plays Claire, a twenty something working at a reputedly haunted hotel just about to close.  Pat Healy plays the distant and sort of strange Luke, a middle aged man who also works the desk and claims to be interested in using EVP to uncover the hotel's infamous ghost, Madelin O Malley.  Madelin was stiffed on her wedding night, killed herself, and her body was stuffed in the trunk of the hotel's basement.For the first half hour of the film, none of this is given what one would call serious treatment.  Claire and Luke goof around, gossip about the famous aged actress played by Kelly McGillis, and it isn't until Claire begins to take the EVP quest seriously that it gets serious.This may lead the viewer to conclude the tragic ending of the film to be a consequence of Claire's overactive imagination or her asthma.  There are a few other things to consider, though.  Why does Lee, McGillis' character, arrive at night just before things get ghostly?  Why, before urging Claire to leave, does Luke say \"I have something to tell you\"?  Was his skepticism a mere front for something else he knew?  Why does Lee's facial profile look so much more youthful the last time we see her?Without giving anything away, it seems to me this is an infinitely more complex movie than most seem to realize.  Absolutely recommended for lovers of horror.  Watch carefully."
B006RECSBC By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Innkeepers is not a typical horror film, and I've got to believe that's the reason it's got a 76% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.Two employees, Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) remain at the Yankee Pedlar Inn. The quaint hotel has fallen on hard times and is about to close. The two spend their remaining time making fun of any last minute guests and work to uncover proof that the old inn is haunted.The ghost is Madeline O'Malley. The story is supposedly true. Philadelphian businessman Thaddeus O'Malley courted her, and they were soon wed. The Yankee Pedlar was to be the location of their honeymoon.Just after the wedding, Thaddeus got word that there was a problem with the sale of a coal mine in upstate Pennsylvania and that he must come immediately. He sends Madeline, alone, ahead of him to The Yankee Pedlar. There's an accident at the mine which claims Thaddeus' life. He didn't change his will, so Madeline would go from rich to penniless. She hung herself. Thus a haunted inn where Madeline roams the halls, plays the piano, etc.What makes The Innkeepers different, is there is little gore. It lumbers along telling the story while introducing the two other guests, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) a television has-been turned psychic, and an old man (George Riddle) who says he's come back to stay in the room where he and his late wife celebrated their honeymoon.Slow moving but worth a look."
B006RECSBC An entertaining dynamic between two awkwardly sweet characters steer this film into a unique mood.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience.Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) work at the Yankee Pedlar Inn and are determined to find evidence of the paranormal within its walls before it goes out of business in its final days.  They have a refreshingly platonic friendship that isn't blurred by the typical nudity-harbingering sexual tension so common among horror ilk.  These two have a natural and playful chemistry; you instantly know that they care about each other and, in effect, it makes viewers care about them.  Already this is a solid victory for any horror movie.Claire is a somewhat awkward but super-nice young woman with a childish verve who finds listening to others to be exhausting, instantly slouching like a dropped marionette.  Luke is a nice, quirky guy who likes getting to know the hotel guests.  Their dynamic is nothing short of cute and it comes with some funny accidental scares.  The director clearly went out of his way to make Paxton look childishly cute whenever possible.  The characters were so well written that I could seriously watch this movie as a dramedy without any horror elements, just to watch Luke and Claire's interactions.  It's all done very well and they're so likeable.They want to find proof of Madeleine O'Malley's haunting.  During the process Claire starts hearing things and some cheap scares really made me smile.  Claire does an overnight ghost recording and picks up on something spooky.TV star Lee Jones (Kelly McGillis) is in town for a convention.  She is a bit distant, in a superior way, but subtly maternal.  She offers her spiritual knowledge and turns out to be a medium.  Some limited communication with \"the other side\" reveals a room in the hotel where something awful happened that Claire must not enter because she \"cannot save\" Madeleine.  The tone shifts from light-hearted to serious as the style of the scares follows suit.  Stranger, graver things start happening involving the hotel guests and further investigations by Claire and Luke.The scares seem simple--like they're meant not to be terrifying, but only jumpy--as if this was made so that preteens could have a \"good\" horror movie that won't leave them traumatized.  This is still enjoyable to adults, though.  There's no creepy, dreadful vibe whatsoever.  It's more like you look forward to things, like with a good mystery novel, than dread them.  \"Spooky\" elements are simply clich&eacute;s executing perfectly; as if this movie was a \"how to\" manual for future horror filmmakers.The camerawork was good; simple, but well-placed and effective.  The movie demanded no more than they gave.Let's be clear.  The horror \"story\" wasn't very good. While I loved the character-driven premise and it carried the movie effortlessly, the horror story itself never really felt like it moved forward and it certainly met us with no resolution at the end whatsoever.  However, I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers is a creepy haunted hotel film. Basically, Claire and Luke work at a hotel that's about to close and they want to prove it's haunted. Madeline O'Malley is the ghost and her design is amazing (the scene in the bedroom gave me chills!). The acting was fine and I actually liked both of the main characters. The comedy bits were also a nice addition (not a horror/comedy though). The music was also well done. It's a slow-burning type of movie; the movie generally moves at a slow pace.The tension it builds works for and against the film. Sometimes, the tension would be dreadful and lead to something terrifying. Other times, the tension would be too long and lead to a weak scare or nothing at all. Which leads to another point, it's not as scary as it could've been. The scares are limited for a 1hr 40min film. The slow pace may also make some people slowly drift away; I'm personally a fan of all horror, especially slow horror though.There is some blood and frightening sequences, no sex or nudity so it's tamed compared to other modern horror films. Definitely recommend to any fans of slow horror."
B006RECSBC Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the \"Horror\" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again."
B006RECSBC While I appreciated the generally positive reception Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" received upon its theatrical run, I fear it may have been oversold as a fright fest. This is a small, but very appealing, piece set in a haunted New England inn that scores more from its human interactions than it does from its supernatural leanings. And that's just fine. If you're anticipating big scares and lots of horror mayhem, though, this may not be the film for you. Its charms are far more subtle and unexpected. In truth, I quite loved this movie. It has modest goals and, by keeping things intimate, succeeds quite admirably in feeling fresh and real. West keeps the effects to a minimum and allows the movie to come alive in the hands of his engaging cast. It's a wise decision as the screenplay is tart and funny and the actors are committed and enthusiastic.Sara Paxton and Pat Healy play hotel clerks spending one last weekend in the historic The Yankee Pedlar Inn before it closes down for good. The rooms are mostly vacant, so the pair of amateur ghost hunters plan to use the opportunity to get physical recordings of its alleged haunting. Most of the film relies on the easy chemistry and camaraderie of Healy and Paxton and they play off each other well. Seriously, I laughed constantly throughout the film--especially due to Paxton's deft performance. Only three rooms have occupants for all or part of the weekend. They contend with a mysterious man with history in the hotel, a wayward wife and her child, and a fading actress (and spiritualist). As the hours progress, Paxton seems to be getting closer to uncovering real spirits. What begins as a lark may be headed for a more serious conclusion.I wasn't particularly familiar with or a fan of Sara Paxton (her resume is populated by such fare as Shark Night 3-D and Lifetime Network's Blue Eyed Butcher), but this is a star making turn. She is so likable and so funny, I was more than willing to go on this adventure with her. Healy is also quite effective. Kelly McGillis (Top Gun, Witness) has one of her best roles in years as the actress. I loved every scene she and Paxton shared. The film ratchets up the tension as it pushes forward, but never attempts to overcomplicate or over-explain things. In the end, it may all be a bit vague in mythology. But truthfully, I didn't care. I so liked the cast and the movie had been so entertaining, I went with the ending even if it seemed a bit tidy (or maybe messy, I'm not sure). Again, this isn't about big scares or horrifying moments. It is largely about what is unseen and how real people react in creepy settings. \"The Innkeepers\" isn't revolutionary, perhaps, but it is funny and engaging. And I've become a huge Paxton fan! KGHarris, 4/12."
B006RECSBC After waiting nearly two years, Ti West's follow-up to his critically acclaimed genre masterpiece, \"The House of the Devil\", is finally here. Giddy with excitement like a child ready to rip open his biggest Christmas present, my expectations were sky high. The movie just had to be a masterpiece, it had to be a unique, one-of-a-kind thriller, and it had to be perfect. I am one of the horror faithfuls that believes that \"House of the Devil\" is THE best horror movie of the last decade and this movie had better come close to that sort of greatness. Does \"The Innkeepers\" reach those lofty heights or does it vanish into thin air like the ghosts it portrays?\"The Innkeepers\" tells the story of The Yankee Pedlar Inn. After over one hundred years of service, The Yankee Pedlar Inn is shutting its doors for good. The last remaining employees -Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) - are determined to uncover proof of what many believe to be one of New England's most haunted hotels. As the Inns final days draw near, odd guests check in as the pair of minimum wage ghosthunters begin to experience strange and alarming events that may ultimately cause them to be mere footnotes in the hotels long unexplained history. Along with them for the ride is a actress turned psychic who may know more than she lets on and an old man who will stay in nothing less than the Honeymoon Suite and may have a connection the a devastating murder that took place years before.\"The Innkeepers\" is terrifically moody with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time. The Inn comes alive in a fresh way that never feels phony or cheap. The actors are also quite good, particularly Paxton as Claire who is headstrong and determined but also has a shy, vulnerable side. The being said, the movie is a lot a buildup for a conclusion that seems fairly ho-hum. I know people bashed HOTD for the same thing but the ending here seems both too delayed as well as rushed, if such a thing is possible. It all just plays kind of false and lessens the stylish chills of the film's first two acts. I don't want it to seem as if I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked it, in fact I liked it a lot. Maybe it was my fault holding this film up to an impossible standard that no film could possibly live up to. HOTD was a masterpiece, this one is a pretty good thriller. Nonetheless, in today's horror market, pretty good is definitely good enough. Just keep your expectations in check. 3.5 out of 5"
B006RECSBC \"You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!\"These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has \"reverse deja vu\" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written \"chills\").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes). Unsatisfying climax and conclusion."
B006RECSBC I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out."
B006RECSBC and that's something most people have forgotten how to use when watching a movie.As in my previous movie review about \"John Dies At the End\" this movie is a perfect example of what I mean when I say people don't like to think when they watch a movie anymore. This film was absolutely amazing for a ghost story and about as real as you can expect in this genre. An old hotel where a death occurred and two hotel workers just trying to put in their days work, loathing the decisions they made in life that made them hotel clerks, and just trying to find something more for themselves aside from their boring jobs. Luke works on his ghost hunting website and Claire is writing a book. To keep themselves entertained they depend on each other and have a strong friendship. Claire likes to support Luke and finds ghost hunting a fun way to spend her long work hours. It's not until strange things start happening that things change for the both of them. This movie has questions but ALL of the answers are given in the story. This movie requires attention be paid to detail and the characters dialogue. Even the ending scene holds a clue to the fate of the main character. EVERYTHING is in the film and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant!To persons that weren't listening,paying attention, or trying to piece together the clues and hints, all they can say is \"It was slow,it was boring,this is a bad horror film,it made me think and my brain hurts,I didn't get it what happened?\". This movie has so many elements to it you really need to PAY ATTENTION.So here it comes \"The story\" and yes there will be *Spoilers!*The Yankee Peddler Hotel is closing down. It's the last weekend of the hotel being opened. It's also the last time Luke and Claire get to find out if there is really a ghost or not in the hotel. It would be a real accomplishment for either of them as neither of them have accomplished anything truly amazing in their lives. It be their own personal victory to finally achieve something in the time they spent at the hotel. Finding the ghostly Bride is the perfect going away present for them. In the last days of the hotel Claire befriends an ex actress/psychic that gives her a small bit of assistance about the ghost of the hotel. The Psychic tells Claire to stay away from the basement and that there are 3 spirits in the hotel. Claire is clueless as to who they are but the psychic can sense it faintly. After some strange events occur on the last night Claire and Luke decide to kick up their ghost hunting game and venture into the basement to connect with the ghost. Low and behold they get what they asks for. Claire can sense the ghost because she is sensitive just like the Psychic ex actress. Except she can see them but she can't tell the future or predict events. For some reason these spirits are attracted to Claire and it's because they are sensitive to her. To Luke he doesn't see or hear the ghosts but the Claire she can. It's the time she spends with the Psychic that stimulates this ability in her. Before she was able to see the ghost she was able to sense then mildly or experience phenomenon where she heard them (like being attracted to the basement and the piano).The spirits were attracted to her energy. Towards the end of the film when Claire becomes more sensitive she is able to hear the ghost and begins following her voice thinking it's the Psychic. Claire finds herself in the basement where she was warned not to go. As she is sensitive to ghost the spirit of the \"Old Man\" finds his way to her energy and Claire being frighting falls down the stairs and hits her head. When she regains herself she sees is aware that the ghostly presence of the old man is following her. Clair runs to the back exit of the basement and closes the door behind her. The door starts moving and she hears banging and is even more frightened and the last thing she sees is the Ghost Bride before her and she blacks out and dies of an asthma attack. The 3 ghosts that the Psychic saw in the basement were The ghost bride,the old man, and Claire herself. Although the psychic said she see's events sometimes not as they are now but in the future. Her vision was of Claire's demise. In the final ending scene at the window we faintly see Claire standing looking out the window then the door slams shut. In reality the knocking and pounding Claire heard at the door was Luke trying to rescue her after he heard her screaming. Luke did not see the ghost or feel them because he was not a sensitive like Claire was. To him the basement was just a basement. There was no spirit of an old man or a bride there. To Claire who was sensitive she could hear and see them and they were attracted to her for that reason. Although the only thing that is never explained is what the ghost want from Claire and the Phsychic ex Actress never mentions anything about it as she is stunned by what she sees will happen in the basement with Claire's death.The Innkeeper's is a great movie with a very sad ending. It can be a reward for those that pay attention or a just a waste of time for those that weren't. This isn't exactly an upbeat film but a film that tries to add a bit of realism by creating realistic characters and more believable story instead of just bumps in the knight. In a way it's almost like some of the audience is Luke who doesn't see anything special or feel anything special from the movie and the rest of the audience is Claire that sees all these things going on and take in what's happening."
B006RECSBC I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price."
B006RECSBC Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS is an atmospheric ghost story, relying on character and low-key shocks.  While I agree with fellow reviewers on the refreshing absence of gore and CGI effects, I find West's movies too formulaic and slow-paced.  INNKEEPERS seems padded and derivative---there's little we haven't seen before, and may seem more original only in comparison to today's more graphic, blood-heavy alternatives.Sarah Paxton (SHARK NIGHT 3D, ENTER NOWHERE) offers an inconsistent performance as the affectatious Claire.  She plays coy and naivete well, but exaggerates many gestures and expressions in her more dramatic scenes.  Pat Healy as Luke is too one-toned to incite any empathy.  TOP GUN's Kelly McGillis takes acting honors as the fading psychic actress, bringing a certain maturity to the film.The script itself is fairly predictable with a clumsy conclusion.  The violin-laden score is appropriately chilling.THE INNKEEPERS is a nice change of pace, b
B006RECSBC My first relevant question would  be - how old was the person who wrote this?My guess would be somewhere around 12.Good ghost films are rare to be sure, and some make a reasonable effort.This one does not."
B006RECSBC The script and dialogue had a cleverness that keep ones intrigue.  Character development was good and should not be overlooked.  Not a horror-teenfest by any means, but just a semi-creepy story that actually does not have super-cliqued ending that I would not ultimately have guessed."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers (Ti West, 2011)Pretty much everyone I know with whom I have discussed The Innkeepers considers it a better movie than Ti West's previous one, The House of the Devil, and one of the reasons I have held off on reviewing it for as long as I have&#8212;I actually watched it for the first time well over a year ago as I write this opening paragraph&#8212;is that after I watched it, I vehemently disagreed. Nothing has happened in the ensuing fifteen months, including rewatching sections of the movie, sometimes obsessively, and discussing it to death with a few folks to try and get what it was I'm missing, but nothing has managed to sway me from my conviction that The House of the Devil is, quite simply, a much better-made film that is more successful at tapping into the homage it's going for than is The Innkeepers. Which is not, I should rush to add (but, curiously, I have not) to say that The Innkeepers is in any way not good. It is still, compared to most recent Hollywood horror fare, head and shoulders above anything else from a major studio you are likely to see within the next year, unless of course Ti West releases something (and doesn't suddenly revert to the guy who made such awful movies as The Roost).Plot: Claire (The Last House on the Left's Sara Paxton) and Luke (Rescue Dawn's Pat Healy) are the last two employees left working at a hotel that is slated for demolition, and all they have to do is get through their last weekend of unremitting boredom, go home, and then forget this place ever existed, right? Well, maybe not. They've never been swamped with customers, but for some reason, there's a steady stream of them this weekend. Well, a trickle, at least. More than usual. And some of them start reporting weird occurrences on the upper floors, leading to the conclusion that, perhaps, this won't be a boring weekend after all; Luke has long been researching the hotel's supposedly haunted past, and Sara finds herself reluctantly drawn into his obsession. But one of the cardinal rules of dealing with haunted places: you don't ever want to try to get the ghosts to talk to you...It's a fun little movie with a killer cast (Kelly McGillis, John Speredakos, Alison Bartlett O'Reilly, etc.) that spends much of its time suggesting, rather than showing, what's going on, and on that level, it succeeds just as well as its predecessor. But I mentioned the homage factor. I kind of have to dance around it here because saying what specific movie it pays homage to would give the entire final sequence away (but if you've got any exposure to the history of horror film, you'll know it the second you see it), but (a) it is obvious that West is once again paying homage here, and once you've seen the final sequence, going back and rewatching certain key scenes will show you it's not limited to the end of the movie, and (b) it's still a glancing blow, as opposed to the bullseye that was The House of the Devil vs. every Satanic Panic movie of the seventies (though if you want a specific movie, the one that always goes most through my head where The House of the Devil is concerned is The Night God Screamed, but kind of in reverse). Because of that, I think, that final sequence, and the denouement that follows it, got robbed of a lot of their power. (And oh, for the love of The Hills Have Eyes, did we really need that final shot? In case you're wondering, Magic 8-ball says &#8220;NO.&#8221;) Still, it's a great deal of fun; just remind yourself that the draggy sections are there for a reason. *** "
B006RECSBC Another nicely done creep fest that I missed in theaters last February, when it was given a limited theatrical run. The Inkeepers, now out on DVD and blu-ray from Dark Sky films, it combines elements of a 90's slacker comedy with a haunted house story. Starting out as a character piece and slowly descending into horror. This is a little more thoughtful than a lot of terror flicks, more leisurely paced, but all the richer for it.Written, directed and edited by Ti West, who previously directed the excellent old school shocker The House of the Devil (2010). This well written and often very funny movie has two twenty-something , the inkeepers of the title, working in an old hotel with minimal guests on the last week before they are closed and subsequently demolished. They are highly susceptible asthmatic Claire (Sara Paxton) and the slightly older Luke (Pat Healy), who have been tracking a ghost who is said to dwell in the hotel, for sometime on their live internet feed. Not much has happened, so far, so Claire decides to help the proceedings along a bit by trying to make contact with the help of a psychic and former TV sitcom star (played by 80's movie star Kelly McGillis) staying at the hotel.The movie works best when it is focusing on the two amiable main characters and there very humorous interactions. Not so much when the film takes a turn towards horror, but at least it is never graphic enough to completely spoil the feel of the earlier scenes. The ghosts are not well developed, we learn next to nothing about them, which frustrated me a bit. This isn't great, but better than a lot of recent chillers, but I still would have preferred anedy old school indie comedy over the admittedly limited spilled bloodcheck out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B006RECSBC Wow, what a boring movie, the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it's the best horror film of the year, what a let down, kept waiting for the horror to come, it didn't, my wife fell asleep it was the interesting, the characters were fine and the acting good, but the story was just not up to par, could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time, sorry I bought it and paid full price, trying to hard, special effects were nothing special, no scares, they say old time creepy, not really, the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie, don't waste your time, though the movie might bore you to death."
B006RECSBC I find myself a bit torn in my opinion of The Innkeepers.  There's a lot to enjoy but there's also a fair amount to dislike about the film.  Director Ti West's story about an aging New England Inn in its final week of operation has a tone unlike most horror films.  There are a lot of elements that don't seem on the surface like they would mix together well, but the enjoyable cast makes the film eminently watchable.Claire (Paxton) and Luke (Healey) are a couple of twenty-something loafers who work at the Yankee Pedlar, a New England inn that is over a hundred years old.  With the owner on vacation, Claire and Luke are the only employees still working at the near-empty inn during its final week of operation.  With few guests to attend, and having to work 12 hour shifts the pair do what they can to amuse themselves and pass the time.  Fancying themselves amateur ghost hunters, they've setup a website to explore the legend of the Yankee Pedlar which is allegedly haunted by the spirit of a Madeline O'Malley, a woman who hung herself on her wedding day when her fianc&eacute; jilted her.As mentioned, The Innkeepers has a strange vibe to it.  The early part of the film has a good deal of comedy as the pair of Luke and Claire engage in various pursuits just to get through the day including drinking beer at the front counter, telling ghost stories to the young son of an annoying guest, just to get under her skin, and dealing with the wacky counterperson at the nearby coffee shop.  This, along with a slow pace doesn't fit with what you expect out of a horror film.  The tone changes abruptly with the arrival of Leanne Reese-Jones (McGillis) a former actress turned psychic.As Claire explores the inn at night with recording equipment, looking to pickup some EVP (electronic voice phenomena) she encounters voices whispering within the walls and the playing of a piano in the front lobby.  A terrified Claire runs to Leanne for help.  The psychic uses her ability to channel the spirits in the inn and warns Claire to stay clear of the basement.  The arrival of an elderly guest who wants to spend one last night in the honeymoon suite completes the transition from slacker comedy to full-on horror culminating with Claire's terrifying encounter with the inn's spirits.I suppose it depends on your outlook as to whether The Innkeeper's faults can be overlooked due to its positives or if it's positives are neutralized by the faults.  West's slow burn of a film develops the characters of Claire and Luke to the point where you can certainly relate to them.  The pair apparently have no prospects once the inn closes.  Claire's redoubtable spunkiness drives much of the action.  Last seen in the horrible film \"Shark Night\", Paxton appears here, sans tiny bikini and without make-up in a huge contrast from that film. There's a brilliantly funny scene as she is trying to open a dumpster lid with one hand and toss in a leaky plastic trash bag for the other...that is just a little too heavy for her to lift with a single hand and avoid whatever noxious contents are spilling out of the bag.  The dialog sparkles with a casual wit.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on a couple of real people when they are talking.But The Innkeepers has a major Achilles heel.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the film's conclusion; so many, in fact, that I found myself re-watching scenes to see if I missed the \"Shamalayan\" moment.  What did Leanne really see when she channeled the spirits?  And what was with her strange staring out of her room's window at the end?  For all of the development of the two leads, West is woefully short on any exposition when it comes to the spirits.  What are their motivations?  Why are they after Claire?  Why was it that Leanne's arrival seemed to have triggered the spirit's activity?  These issues prevent The Innkeepers from having the clean ending that most viewers desire.  But maybe that's what West was going for all along.Blu-Ray ExtrasTwo Audio commentaries: One with Writer/director/editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director/sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.Behinds the Scenes Featurette"
B006RECSBC I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was."
B006RECSBC \"This weekend's gonna be it. We're gonna get something good, I can feelit.\" During the final week at the Yankee Pedlar Inn the remainingemployees Claire (Paxton and Luke are determined to find out if thehotel is haunted. When events begin to happen that make them feel theyare right the two employees get more then they asked for. I have neverreally been a big horror movie fan. The ones I do like are the morepsychological ones with an actual story to them. I like the \"Saw\"series, but most of the \"torture-porn\" to me is not horror. All thatsaid I liked this movie. While this is not a typical horror and is nota fast moving movie at all it is still good enough to keep youwatching. For a lower budget movie the acting is actually really goodand there are scenes that will make you tense b
B006RECSBC A historic inn is closing after many years, closing not only a connection to the past but also a connection to what happened in the basement. There is a legend about a death and about a body, and it leads to stories told by patrons and staff alike. The two people on-shift have taken note of it too, one going as far as to make a website of his encounter and the other just wanting to look around. what begins as fun at closing time starts to slide into contact, and contact leads to more as the inn slides toward being forgotten.I'll be honest, I had high hopes for this film and actually picked it up after seeing some solid reviews.  for some reason, slow building horror movies seem to make a dent with people who lean toward more mainstream films, and that is alright. If that includes your forays into horror and suspense, this might even be something for you. I liked parts of it, and might have liked it more if something would have happened to keep me going. You had a lot of moments that went up in tempo, getting the music playing and the thrills kicking, and you had things that manifested here and there that seemed to say escalation was in order. In fact, it kept on doing that while trying to stay tense but it all felt hollow after a while, like there should have been a few less false alarms and more contact.Basically, I felt like you had an interesting start, some spooky \"did you hear that\" moments, a nice payout toward the end with minimal effects and a \"its there\" without the audience seeing it approach to haunting, and an decently interesting end you could see coming. The issue I had was the how long a lot of this took and how redundant revisiting a psychic or watching someone try to find what is making that sound can become. Removing the end because it should always have some payout, a few EVP moments done by not one but two people, a few doors closing and many false alarms, and a strange old man do not making a haunting. It did have some eerie moments and it had all the elements, but just felt like it felt incomplete.to me, the Innkeepers felt like a promise being made and never delivered. That's why I'm going 3/5, saying it was ok, but it should have been better."
B006RECSBC It seems like every few years there is a new \"hot\" horror director who everybody thinks has found the magic formula, bringing the same level of thrills as the classics but doing it in a fresh new way. Most of these filmmakers fade away into straight-to-DVD land or into making survival horror video games. It's a hard genre to crack, but occasionally one director appears and proves he's truly worth keeping a close watch on. Although he's been around for years, Ti West's biggest break came with 2009's creepily retro The House of the Devil, which was so good a number of critics had it in their top 10 of the year. When was the last time that happened? His follow-up, The Innkeepers, is similar in that it's a twist on a familiar theme, that of the \"haunted hotel\". Even more, it shows that West isn't content to indulge in the gruesome, or fall back on lame jump cuts for cheap scares. Instead he relies on good old fashioned tension building and humor to make for a moody, effective thriller.The Yankee Pedlar has seen better days. The old hotel is creaking to it's final weekend before being turned into a parking lot. The place is basically abandoned, with even the owner not caring enough to stick around. Even his choice in who will manage the place to it's inevitable fate shows how little concern there is for the old, supposedly haunted building. Claire(Sara Paxton), a perky, asthmatic cherub with a runaway imagination; and Luke(Pat Healy), a smart mouthed wannabe ghost hunter struggle to even keep towels handy for the few remaining guests.  One of those is Leanne Rease-Jones(an unrecognizable Kelly McGillis) a former actress turned psychic/soothsayer, who puffs her cigarette and fingers her power crystal between disapproving glares at Claire.West structures his film in three short chapters, and those who are used to a constant barrage of loud \"booms\" and crashing piano keys might want to go home and watch their copy of The Grudge. The West has the feel of an old TV horror anthology, or an episode of The Twilight Zone. It relies mainly on atmosphere, and giving us a peek inside the minds of the characters we'll be terrified for later. In this case, boredom and idleness have taken over Claire and Luke's brains, with the emptiness of the building not helping the situation. Luke has put together an upstart website focusing on the paranormal, and Claire has become obsessed with the story of a woman who was left for dead in the basement and continues to haunt the hotel. While a little meandering, these first two chapters never fail to be attention grabbing, with West's script keeping the tone light,  the casual banter between Paxton and Healy often hilarious and even a little flirty. Well, as flirty as it gets for two such social outcasts. He clearly has a thing for her, but she's way too spacey to notice or care.There's a very thin line between comedy and terror when it comes to genre flicks like this, and West walks that tightrope with ease. His use of humor might seem out of place, especially for such an extended period of time, but by the time the final chapter rolls around you realize it was all done for a purpose. Your defenses lowered and all too relaxed, the genuine scares of the final chapter hit you like a sucker punch to the gut. West sets us up perfectly, with some fantastic camerawork, from long tracking hallway shots to some brilliant use of angles to keep us totally in the dark. Even when the film appears to be drifting along, there's a foreboding air just beneath the surface. When Luke starts warning Claire about the dangers of chasing ghosts, that she'll start to become paranoid, we know it won't be long before that very thing happens. But what fun it is to watch as it does!The best horror filmmakers are masters at playing all of the audiences emotions to maximum effect, and after only a handful of films, Ti West has proven himself to be one who can."
B006RECSBC Ti West's The Innkeepers (2011) spends most of its time in a small inn, immersing you in a strange reality where the emphasis is on the paranormal.  This slow burn is mostly atmospheric, as not a great deal seems to happen, but if you stick with it, you may be in a receptive frame of mind, for the unsettling conclusion.With a somewhat notorious history, the Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close.  The establishment is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a woman who killed herself in the inn, after being abandoned by her husband.  While the owner is away, employees Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) make up the entire staff for the last few days.  With not much to do, these ghost hunter wannabes pass their time looking for evidence of Madeline's presence.  The inn is nearly empty, with actress turned medium Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), being one of the final guests.Claire is the more active ghost hunter, and she confides in Rease-Jones after a spooked Luke flees from the inn.  With some psychic ability, Leanne is able to offer some assistance, as she and Claire venture into the basement, where the ghost is supposed to dwell.  Leanne advises Claire that they need to leave immediately.  Claire attempts to clear out the last of the guests, but discovers that he has already checked out.  Back in the lobby, she finds that Luke has returned, but Leanne is now absent.  The end is near, but will they all survive?The Innkeepers moves at a leisurely pace.  Claire and Luke have so little to do, that even providing fresh towels is a major undertaking.  Mostly free to do as they wish, and seemingly fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal, we come to know them as two different varieties of geek.  Claire is hyper, goofy, clumsy, and often behaves like a child.  Luke has a hairdo like Tin Tin, is something of a cynic, and acts like Claire's smartass older brother, although he is actually attracted to her.  Healy and Paxton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.  Her role as a medium may be something of a clich&eacute;, but even with limited screen time Kelly McGillis manages to bring some credibility to it.With such a substantial buildup, you fully expect a paranormal incident of some kind.  Unfortunately, what occurs may not be quite enough to satisfy.  There are some creepy moments, cheesy jump scares, and decent special effects, but the magnitude of the horror isn't exactly overwhelming, and is sure to have some asking \"Is that it?\", when the film is over.Ti West's approach, reminiscent of some traditional 70's ghost stories, may be a fun change of pace for some.  Although rated R, what happens appears to fall well within the PG13 sphere.  The story holds together fairly well until the end, when the bottom falls out, and the door slams shut on the events at the Yankee Pedlar Inn."
B006RECSBC \"The Innkeepers\" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (\"The House of the Devil\") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of \"The Innkeepers,\" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.\"The Innkeepers\" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.\"The Innkeepers\" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then \"The Innkeepers\" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing."
B006RECSBC This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake.  It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying."
B006RXPUQ8 The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1,doesn't show any understanding of science ( you can't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ),and,2, tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda, and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist' wants to clone people, why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess. A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse. Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven. He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear. Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind, just like all the people in the church did.'Mad scientist' was trying to clone jesus! Wants the boy to forgive him! Shoots mom whos body disapears. But, oops!, the boy isn't Jesus, he's the anticrist. Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock' joke.Don't waist your time on this; theres nothing new or well done here."
B006RXPUQ8 Excuse the cheesy line, but I'm Not Jesus Mommy isn't a good film. The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she's not capable of having children. The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation, 9 months after that, then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost. The story really doesn't bother explaining much. It's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible. Kimberly, the mother character, has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful-to-watch performance, she has some potential though. Also, if you watched the teasers/trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen, but it really has only a few similarities.However, I did enjoy the music in the film a lot. Also, David, the child, was often genuinely creepy. I didn't dislike this film because of its scientific or religious elements; I dislike this film because it's simply a poorly executed movie.I do not recommend directly paying to watch I'm Not Jesus Mommy. If you must watch this movie, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/17/12 to save some money."
B006RXPUQ8 I'm Not Jesus Mommy (Vaughn Juares, 2010)For the first third or so of its length, save some subpar acting, I'm Not Jesus Mommy is an intriguing little low-budget movie that, on many levels, makes perfect sense. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath in her first feature), an obstetrician, is haunted by her own inability to conceive. When maverick researcher Roger Gibson (Living Arrangements' Charles Hubbell) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning, she resists at first, but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives. The obvious question becomes: how far will a woman go to have a baby?Then we skip forward seven years, and everything goes to hell. Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age. The streets are dangerous, there is little food to go around, and Roger, Roger's sister, Kimberly, and Kimberly's son David are holed up in a small apartment, only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food. The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising, no? And perhaps in the right hands, the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be. But, and isn't there always a &#8220;but&#8221; after a statement like that?, it...isn't. I'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully, so I'll go with &#8220;I'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity.&#8221;  One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved, so the &#8220;some subpar acting&#8221; of the first third, which you can gloss over with everything else going on, takes center stage.  Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich&eacute;&#8212;in fact, runs headlong into it as often as possible&#8212;and you've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through.  Don't hit play on this one unless you have prepared yourself for an overdose of cheese. *"
B006RXPUQ8 Creepy, scary, suspenseful and love watching over and over. I love Amazing post apocalyptic movies and this one is a doozy."
B006RXPUQ8 When I read about the film in Redbox (Devil's Angel), it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes. I won't do that per se, but the film is so bad, spoilers won't matter.Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel (Bridget McGrath) can not have a child, but keeps on trying. She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a \"come to Jesus film\" except the \"good guys\" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the \"secret\" of the film by reading the by-line I couldn't help but think during the film...\"Funny. He doesn't look Jewish.\"Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bridget McGrath cleavage."
B006RZZDU4 Action packed, intelligent, creative, fun to watch on Kindle Fire.  Great writers and great Special affects that keep you glued to your chair and Kindle fire, if your wife does not need anything for duration!"
B006RZZDU4 This is a very good animation of iron man and the characters and story line was very good also.  When I watched Iron Man 3 and they mentionextremis and I decided to watch the animation series again and I enjoyed it very much. But it is more for mature audiences than children."
B006RZZDU4 4/5 for great story.Pros:1. Story is excellent.2. Decent visuals for a motion comic.3. It's the most epic Iron Man moment.Cons:1.  Story could be told in a more direct way.2.  Motion comics typically do not look very smooth and remind me of animations you might see on Newgrounds.3.  Voice acting could be a lot better, though it isn't bad per se."
B006RZZDU4 Show has elements from movie and animation is cool as a moving comic.  Great to be able to view on Kindle Fire HD."
B006RZZDU4 I ordered this movie series because of my little grandson.  He loves the  action but at 3 yrs he doesn't stay long on any one show.  The older grandkids will enjoy the entire series."
B006RZZDU4 Very fresh update telling of Iron Man series, the only problem I have with it is that it's a motion comic which I have yet to get used to. Would definitely recommend it if you like the Iron Man series."
B006RZZDU4 This series ie worth watching if you like the minimalist animated Comic Book style.  I do and so its entertaining to me.  My wife on the other hand found it a bit boring.If you enjoy modern comic art this should be a treat, if not you probably won't."
B006RZZDU4 I actually like watching this animated series with my 4yr old.He likes all the super hero stuff though....but then so do I."
B006S0007E I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons. Buy the movies instead. They're more entertaining."
B006S0007E This is a stop motion comic book and I enjoyed it very much.  Years ago marvel came out with comics books on CD for the computer which I brought and they was very good but I think the public was not ready for the CDs and they did not sell.  I still have these disc but they plays on a very old cumputer system like window 98 and I canot play them anymore but I enjoyed them very much and I am glad they came out with the stop motion comics.  This is a good buy."
B006S0007E Considering the current level of animation this is almost primitive, though well-drafted. Animation is sparse and motion is often portrayed by moving the static image in the frame which I found to be like watching shadow puppets. It's well-written and probably too mature and cerebral for children. Not really a waste of time but not action entertainment or even decent anime."
B006S0007E The so-called animation for this series was interesting.  I guess it's been referred to as &#34;motion comic&#34; and that's certainly a much more applicable term.  Basically, there's very little movement/animation, so it's like reading or hearing a comic book, but with some minor animations.  Normally, that's not my cup of tea, but I've given this four stars because the writing of this series was good enough to keep me interested in this motion comic series.  I would, however, caution you to expect far more Loki than Thor, so the title is somewhat misleading."
B006S0007E Interesting and boring all at once comic books have traditionally been meant as a moral compass for the youth of the US, and, in more recent times, for cultures world-wide.  So it is that the Norse god of thunder and his apparently \"adopted\" brother Loki are pitted against one another in a sort of Kane and Abel kind of story, where one has the unique opportunity to get rid of the competition.After much hemming and hawing the plot is finally put into motion, but with unsurprising results.  I say unsurprising because I have a hard time believing that a disgruntled brother, one who has a history of malfeasance, would transform so in the amount of time given to this story.  Particularly since he comes from an extremely bloody pantheon and society based upon combat and bloodshed.  But, that's the magic of comic books.The technical merits of the film are interesting.  Fully rendered comic book panels are rendered into CGI animation, and proves an interesting watch.  Moreover actually bringing the actual comic book experience to life, so to speak, perhaps not to ironically enough, shows how rediculous some of the stories actually are, and exposes the time twisting that comic book artists and story tellers use to convey their psychological message.  Think about how much time has passed in all four episodes of this saga, and think about Loki's resolution to his own dilemma.Not bad, really, but not amazingly good.  If you're into comic books, then this should entertain.  Otherwise I'd skip it."
B006SV4QFK I love books. And art supplies. And all things Disney. And... well, the list goes on.  So, I'll confess that I like shows about hoarding because they nudge me to weed out and reorganize. I never want my home to resemble what I see on &#34;Hoarders.&#34;However, at a certain point -- and Season 5 of &#34;Hoarders&#34; seems to be there -- the &#34;ah-HA!&#34; light bulb turns on. Instead of the cool, quirky, &#34;Wow... how very weird!&#34; intrigue of the cases featured on the show... well, this season seems sad.All of these people seem mentally ill. Most have experienced some kind of trauma that triggered the impulse to hold onto everything, or build an insulating wall of stuff around them as a defense, or both.  And, all of them have made their own lives a misery and had a profoundly negative impact on people they love.I'm not sure that should be on the TV as entertainment. Unfortunately, they're not actual documentaries, either. I mean, we all know the problems we're seeing aren't actually resolved in an hour, a week, or even a year, no matter how great the aftercare.So, while these shows still kick me into gear so I revisit my various personal indulgences (like books and art supplies), the subject -- as something to watch on TV -- has become less entertaining.  Instead of taking the show in the direction of weirder & weirder collections and hoarding efforts, this season seemed to head in an unhappy direction. They're featuring more deeply traumatized people with more devastating and tragic impacts on the people around them.I'll continue watching because I'm hoping the producers realized most viewers aren't there to see the train wreck.  We don't turn on the TV to pity others... do we?  Well, maybe I'm one of a minority of viewers who watch &#34;Hoarders&#34; (and similar TV shows) for two reasons: To see how very interesting people are when they allow collecting to run wild, and to recognize those impulses we all have, and clean house long before collecting becomes a problem."
B006SV4QFK This show has inspired me to clean up my stuff.  Vance thinks his IQ is 200, yet he's not smart enough to figure out how to clean his house.  He's the kind of person teaching at your child's university."
B006SV4QFK This show shows you just how things can get out of control.  I feel for these people who live alone and have just given up on life, it's very sad.  Some of them seem like really nice people and this shouldn't be happening to them.  If you want a dose of reality, this is a show to watch.  Sometimes when I think times are tough, this show proves it could be a lot worse.  The 1-800-GOT-JUNK guys seem really nice and considerate of people's possessions, given the situation.  Dorothy is great, Matt is wonderful and I absolutely love Dr. Zasio!  They are all wonderful people who try to help those less fortunate.  A true reality show!!!"
B006SV4QFK I know people who are &#34;collectors&#34; but what they collect have value.  A person who collects junk definitely needs professional help!  Another thing I cannot understand is how people can live in such filth!  You have to have a mental problem in order to do so.I watch these shows and they reassure me that I'm still all right!"
B006SV4QFK mental illness is a fascinating thing and how people get attached to objects because they've been let down by friends or family is really fascinating. I don't, however, feel sorry for them. they are fully aware of what they are doing"
B006SV4QFK After watching these people I feel like I need to take a shower. Where do they find these hoarders they make it seem like there is one in every neighborhood. The show is good but after a couple of episodes it is all the same someone with OCD who has too much stuff and can't part with it. I often wonder if it is even real. One season would have been enough."
B006SV4QFK We watch this almost like watching a train wreck. So many people with some kind of quirky genetic makeup! They could all be related. Always mention some tragic event which triggers the hoarding behavior. Not sure that makes sense when so many people handle tragedies every day. Love how the team manages to scoop out much of the mess and it always gives us incentive to drop off a load at Goodwill!"
B006SV4QFK It is amazing to me how some people live their lives. This show shows some pretty extreme cases of hoarding and the steps they take to fix the situation."
B006SV4QFK Barbara has a messy house where she cares for her grandson.  He's a cutie-puh-tootie.  She has beef with her daughter-in-law and seemed like a white Mother Jefferson to me.No offense, one notices that Richard is a swishy fishy.  You hear nothing about a wife or girlfriend in the picture.  The therapist said, \"Richard is not secure in his identity.\"  His sister said, \"Richard is keeping a secret from us.\"  So near the end, words come up that Richard finally tells his siblings what any viewer would know from jump.  It's a bit anti-climactic that they don't film it.  I'm guessing his adult siblings didn't care because they could just assume it.  I wish the show had interviewed them about it.  If you see the cartoon \"Drawn Together,\" every character's face turns into a donkey's when they say \"Duhhhhhh!!!\" when the fey character comes out.  The same will happen here.  In short, the pink elephant in the room is so obviously a pink triangle, that it really shouldn't have been an issue.To be honest, sometimes the \"Hoarders\" episodes with closeted or out rainbow-flag men are the most interesting.  I recommend this, despite my frustrations."
B006SV4QFK Frank and Mike manage to find plenty of good items to look at and make offers on. I always like to see them make a fair offer, and often they hit the jackpot. It's a win-win situation."
B006SV4QFK The minds of some people are very interesting.  It is sad but the reality exists and shedding light on it helps to bring it out if the shadows and into the light where it can be addressed. I thinks it is a fascinating show."
B006SV4QFK No, I'm not a hoarder but may have a mental problem with getting enough of this series. It is disturbing yet as soon as one episode ends I can't wait for the next one to begin. I've known hoarders in my lifetime and this show presents them perfectly. In most cases they will glom on to their worthless and disgusting junk at the expense of their family and friends.I guess I have a stomach of steel as this is my &#34;go to&#34; lunchtime show. I can't get enough."
B006SV4QFK If you do, just watch The Hoarders. I always find it amazing that these people get so irrate with those who want to help and love them. Most choose things over their family...so sad.  I do realize they are sick in their own way, but I always walk away from this program feeling that my house is immaculate."
B006SV4QFK Unreal. Have heard of this problem and I think most people have seen garages or basements that have &#34;stuff&#34; that should go but is &#34;needed.&#34; May watch a few more on my kindle fire. Loaded and played with no problems."
B006SV4QFK I'm not at all sure there is anything better than an exclusive tour of other people's filth. THAT is entertainment!"
B006SV4QFK Sad to peek into the mind of a sick person. Where things rule their life and human interaction is very damaged.  What I wondered is how family can allow things to get so out of hand.  It is like watching a sickening warm film, you have to see how it ends,"
B006SV4QFK Very interesting......this show makes me feel good about myself and helps me keep my house clean!"
B006SV4QFK I love watching this show, because it gives me the feeling of having just cleaned my house from top to bottom without actually having to do anything."
B006SV5Z0U My granddaughter (20 years old) and I watched the whole series in a marathon all nighter. We laughed our heads off. Haven't had that much fun with her and a TV since she liked Disney."
B006SV5Z0U A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.The above was my review for Season 10. All of these episodes present variations of the 'typical' profile of substance abusers. This is not to negate an individuals circumstances but to emphasize their personalities. There is an accurate portrayal of dysfunction within the family unit and other relationships. The multiple substances of choice offer a wide spectrum and an accurate description of the medical/mental consequences.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.' If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min production by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate."
B006SV5Z0U Nothing special, the formula seems to work for the show but I am finding it starting to drag on. Same ol, same ol."
B006SV5Z0U Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face.  Richard dealt with his dear sister's death and being molested for years without others knowing.  He's had it tough, but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure, except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell.  Richard did some activist/non-profit work; I'm guessing he had anti-drug resources that he didn't bother to access.  Yes, his brother is/was homophobic, but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around.  He is sucking his mother dry of money.  The work never mentions HIV/AIDS, but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any \"Intervention\" episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones.  Richard wasn't even brave enough to stay.  You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs.  I highly doubt that.  He just seemed very nasty and abusive.  I can't imagine him staying sober.  He really needs to do nicer things so he can get some good Karma.  Otherwise, he's in BIG, BIG trouble!"
B006SV5Z0U and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better"
B006SV5Z0U I can't stop watching this show - it is so dramatic but in a real way.  It is heartbreaking but often redeeming as well."
B006TA764S This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a \"kill list\".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence."
B006TA764S A strange ultra violent descent into Hell is what this film is. Some have thought the ending is out of left field but if you watch closely throughout and just let the film wash over you, it makes sense. The musical score adds to the tension so much. Not since Rosemary's Baby have I felt the musiccontributed in such an unnerving way. Rent this if you want something different than the usual horror films that have ruined the genre lately."
B006TA764S Surreal best describes.  It may even have spiritual/philosophical undertones.. there's an air of pagan magic and \"the occult\" about it as well.  While it starts off in the hitman thriller genre it slowly morphs into something more akin to \"The Wicker Man\" (the original 70s version is the best) or \"Race With The Devil (Peter Fonda/1975).  The fact that it can be so open to interpretion, the fact that it veers off the tracks of the \"real world\" into a world of cosmic grand conspiracy against the main protagonist, the mysterious \"Thank yous\" from all around this bewildered hit man, and what finally happens in the end, somehow bring it back to the possibility of moral lesson or cosmic point, albeit one taught by the devil in the realm of the acid trip.  The movie succeeds in its utter ability to stump or be understood within the confines of realism - a realism which is the initial basis of the movie.  British movies have done this to us before - see \"If\".  And yet from beginning to end it's a well-made and interesting story that quickly involves the watcher.  Whether you're a fan of the abstract or not, it's not a hard movie to watch though there's no doubt it baffles in its ending.  And this will be the chief criticism against it.  The brilliance or lack thereof will largely depend on the interpretation the viewer brings to it.  I don't claim to understand it but I fairly enjoyed it."
B006TA764S I do remember commenting at its end that it was a decent watch.  Obviously, once is enough. So enough said."
B006TA764S This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story. Watch the first scene and pay attention, because that's exactly how the rest of the film will be. And don't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in, either. It's very tame and unrealistic. Too bad. Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story."
B006TA764S This is by far one of the most polarizing films you're ever bound to see if you've even heard of it, but Ben Wheatley's KILL LIST is definitely unforgettable, love it or hate it.The film does change thematically throughout and becomes more of a stream-of-consciousness style of film rather than a more traditional narrative structure. Basically we have the wedded bliss of contract killer Jay (Neil Maskell) and his former military wife Shel (MyAnna Buring) being interrupted by his failure eight months before of completing a job and hasn't been able to get one since. The world economic strife is hitting them hard, and Jay has sort of lost his nerve. Jay and Shel are almost constantly arguing and undermining each other, with their son hearing all of it. But when old friend/contract killer Gal (Michael Smiley) comes by with a new job to clean the dust off Jay and get everything back to where it all was for them before all this agitation. The job, presented by a rather devious and malevolent cabal, is the killing of three people, guilty of various (and partially unknown) crimes. Gal and Jay begin this job in order to get paid, and in order to restore Jay back to the proper and formidable villain he once was. But these three murders turn out to be something quite different and far more sinister once we reach the last act of the film, and our protagonists are now in more danger than the people they were pursuing.Wheatley films KILL LIST with a eye for craftsmanship and for cinema verite style filmmaking. Almost all of the scenes have a very documentarian feel to them and it just makes the moments of violence and horror that much more unsettling, until you get to the muscle-clenching climax, where the editing becomes much more disjointed and jagged. The scenes between Jay, Gal, and Shel have a very workaday feel to them. These people have no illusions about the nature of the work they do; this work just happens to be to their skill set, and they're good at it... or at least they used to be before things went wrong in the previous months. There's no philosophical rumination about the amoral nature of being a hired killer here; this is just a job to them, and it's that sort of attitude that works to the film's advantage. There's no romanticism of the trade here. Being a contract killer is not a glorious job, and this film does put that element out there really skillfully. Maskell, who has made a good name for himself in British TV and film, does a terrific job being the film's anchor. We share in his frustration, his anger, his justifiable rage and his fear. Buring, who is better known stateside for her small but significant roles in two Neil Marshall films: THE DESCENT and DOOMSDAY, as well as a role in TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN (Pts 1 and 2), is a combination of roles that only a wife and a mother and a killer can deliver. She's a dynamic performer who obviously has a distinct flavor for genre films. The real standout here is Smiley as Gal, who plays him with just the proper mix of aloof and serious and undenaibly likable. He's appeared before for Wheatley and alongside Maskell in one of their previous efforts called DOWN TERRACE, and he's a terrific performer.Although, no amount of plot description or analysis of acting or directing will be able to distill how the film turns and twists until it's something nearly unrecognizable. This will be a love-it-or-hate-it third act, although upon repeated viewings (which is almost required with this film), it remains ambiguous as far as what you've just seen.Listening to the commentary track for this film from director Wheatley and writer Amy Jump, or the cast commentary by Maskell, Buring and Smiley, the tone certainly doesn't match what's on-screen. They seem to be having a terrific time talking about making the film, but make sure that they don't give facts about the controversial ending, and rather discussing how ambiguous it was and why they wanted to keep it that way.I learned about KILL LIST from a website talking about SXSW releases and how this was one of the best and most unusual selections, and I wished I was with someone while watching, because I got it on demand from my cable company when it was in limited release in theatres and I desperately wanted to talk to someone about it immediately after. I will say that it left a very similar impression upon my psyche as SE7EN did back in 1995. It took me a while to recover from the shock and the disturbing nature of the ending, but when a film has the power to do that, it's something to relish, despite how compelled you might be to look away.KILL LIST is one of my ten favorite films of 2011, and as I stated previously, you will either love this film or you'll hate it, but regardless, it will stay with you."
B006TA764S First, get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble.  Or use subtitles.  I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy. Because that's pretty much what the writers did.  Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess. Or they were channeling \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".  There is nothing coherent about this movie.  It simply makes no sense.  You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan, but the bottom line is that it's just a bad movie.  It's billed as the number one horror movie of the year. Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck. Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap.  Oh, it was gory and bloody alright.  But horrifying?  I'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying, but not this.  Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie. And just because a movie makes you think, doesn't make it good. Actually, the only three thoughts you'll have is 1) what the hell is going on? 2) When will this crap end? and 3) How can I get my money back?.  Go see Expendables 2.  It's a bad movie too, but at least it's entertaining.  You'll never say that about Kill List."
B006TA764S gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."
B006TA764S I had a lot of trouble just making out the dialogue either because of the audio quality, the particular British accents the actors adopted, and/or my own aging ears, but on the other hand, what's going on is pretty self-evident.  Two former military buddies get together to collaborate on working as professional hitmen because they need the money and one of them has to live down a botched job in Kiev.  He brutally kills a number of allegedly bad people as if to make up for his previous slip-up, until the two of them run into a bit of a pickle in the end (to say the least).  In between all the blood and guts spilled, the men act like normal if a bit neurotic blokes, one of them with an unbelievably loyal wife and kid and the other with an attractive but mysterious girlfriend with an apparent penchant for witchery of the black kind.It's not the kind of film that I normally watch because of the gore and violence level, but it features excellent acting, very effective background music, and sickeningly realistic special effects.  It's kind of like a Quentin Tarantino film on steroids. I wouldn't recommend it except to those with a strong stomach, so I'm only giving it three stars."
B006TA764S In all honesty I didn't know what I was getting myself into with this British film directed by Ben Wheatley.  I almost pulled the plug as the first act seemed to drone on endlessly with no point.  In addition, although I'm no newcomer to various English accents coming out of the U. K., no matter how loud I turned up the sound, I couldn't comprehend what half the words were.  So my fellow Americans, my advice is go ahead and put on the English subtitles, shift gears and hang on for one of the most head-scratching films you'll see.The movie evolves from a domestic squabble between Shel (MyAnna Buring), a former Swedish soldier and Jay (Neil Maskell), a temporarily unemployed killer-for-hire.  After a job went south in Russia, Jay's nerves are a bit shaky but his partner in crime, Gal (Michael Smiley), convinces him it's time to get back in the game.  They do and their targets are focused on a priest and likely pedophile and a porn distributor.At this stage we're not too concerned about their fate.  They deserve what they get.  Yet something is amiss.  They thank Jay before their demise.  Events become more and more unsettling as their search for their targets drives them into areas they (and I) didn't see coming.  The occult and Satanism show their faces.  As the movie shifts into high gear, it also changes tone, now entering some scary and gory horror.  And Wheatley and his writing partner, Amy Jump, don't pull their punches.  I'm still trying to figure out what I just saw.  I suspect you might too."
B006TA764S Are you kidding me!  That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time.  This was not scary and the concept was very poor...watch this if you want to waste time and money."
B006TA764S Kill List (Ben Wheatley, 2011)I have talked, over the years, a number of times about the importance of studios marketing their movies correctly, and how the mismarketing of a movie can lead to not one, but two related, major problems: the audience who should be seeing the movie not cottoning to its existence, and the audience who should not be seeing the movie (those it is being marketed to) sitting down with it, finding something entirely different than they were told they'd be getting, and absolutely hating it as a result. Between these two problems, the movie ends up becoming almost universally reviled, and then that first group, the ones who would probably get a great deal out of it, hear it sucks and never get there in the first place. I've used all my favorite whipping boys for this in recent reviews, so let me introduce you to an incredible Chicago filmmaker by the name of Ricardo Islas. Islas makes what I like to call aggressively-indie films. They have no discernible budget, use sets that are just as ridiculous as those you find in Ulli Lommel and Uwe B&ouml;ll movies (though given Islas' budget, they make a lot more sense here), star a bunch of people you've never heard of, and are consistently marketed as horror movies. In some cases, that kind of makes sense; when you title one of your movies The Zombie Farm, you gotta figure someone's going to pick up on the fact that the movie contains zombies and act accordingly. But kids who have been raised in the post-Romero era, and who have never seen White Zombie or any of the other movies that treat zombies in a more traditional way are going to look at The Zombie Farm and say \"what the hell is this crap?\". (The Zombie Farm, by the way, is a fantastic little thriller, and while it's not Islas' best work--when I started this paragraph I had intended to harp on the brilliance of my favorite movie of his, Lockout--but you gotta see it anyway.)NOTE: while the spoiler stop sign is below, this is one case where I will be actively encouraging you to read the spoilers in question, as I believe NOT knowing them will negatively affect your viewing of them film (there is more than enough spoiler-laden evidence of this on the IMDB boards to justify this decision).[for those of you not reading this at var.everta, imagine there's a big \"SPOILER ALERT! stop sign here.]What does all of this have to do with Ben Wheatley?, you may be asking yourself. It has to do with Wheatley because Kill List, in everything I heard and read about the movie before I actually saw it, including all of the reviews I allowed myself to read, posited Kill List as Yet Another British Crime Thriller, but a cut above the usual malarkey. So I'm sitting down with this movie thinking I'm going to get another Ray Winstone movie (and wondering why Ray Winstone is, in fact, not in this film), and instead I get The Wicker Man. Except that it took me about thirty minutes of my sitting there saying \"what the [censored for Amazon consumption] did I just watch?\" to realize that I had, in fact, seen a movie that had far more in common with The Wicker Man and the not-quite-Hammer films of its early-seventies ilk than anything Guy Ritchie ever did. (And, as Captain Peacock was wont to say, \"Thank Heaven for that.\") But still, I did sit there for thirty minutes asking myself the question. And here's where the marketing bit comes in. I admit, I came quite late to The Wicker Man. I first saw it when I was in high school, though I can't give you a specific year; it was sometime in the mid-eighties. I loathed it, but I knew exactly what I was getting into thanks to the VHS box copy and everything I'd read about the film. I knew there was a supernatural element to it from the outset, and I was prepared for that. (I didn't form my current love of the film until the 104-minute cut was released in the late-nineties, which made much more sense out of the incomprehensible soup that was the initial American theatrical cut. And as I write this, it was just announced earlier this week that something I have been hoping would happen for over a decade has finally come to pass: the twenty-two minutes of footage from the original 126-minute cut, which me pal Ian Davey has been telling me forever was probably part of the M1, has been found, and there's a newly-remastered director's cut coming on DVD eventually. Oh, happy day.) And for all I know this entire paragraph is a spoiler, and you're not supposed to know about the supernatural element to this movie until it's sprung on you. If so, well, I'll put the spoiler stop sign up at the top of this paragraph when I publish it, but hey guys? That was a really, really bad idea, not letting the public know that this wasn't your basic Britcrime movie.It starts out that way. Jay (Atonement's Neil Maskell), an ex-army hit man, hasn't worked in eight months, and the money's run out. Something horrible happened on his last job, but other than us finding out something horrible happened on his last job, we never get any details. His wife Shel (The Descent's MyAnna Buring) is sick of him moping about the house and, in the kind of manipulative move that drives me bats, invites Jay's old partner Gal (Burke and Hare's Michael Smiley) and his new girlfriend Fiona (TV actress Emma Fryer in her first credited feature appearance) over for dinner so Gal can pitch a new job he's just picked up to Jay. Despite his misgivings, Jay is intrigued, so they go to meet the client (Chariots of Fire's Struan Rodger). Seems simple enough: three murders, no questions asked, for an unthinkable sum of money. The first one makes very little sense, but it's quick and easy. The second starts putting the pieces together, and Jay, once he figures out the connection between the three victims, starts off on his own tangent......absolutely none of which has to do with the horror element, really, though all of it does, in murky ways that I can't address without going deep into spoiler territory here. It's a decent movie, and I am certain I would have liked it better had I known what I was getting. The acting is, in general, quite good, though in a number of cases the actors are making the best they can out of mediocre material (did anyone buy the relationship between Jay and Shel? Really?), and the movie is excellently-paced once you figure out what Wheatley's doing, or what you think he's doing. Granted, it's not The Wicker Man (or A Serbian Film, to which it has also been compared many times), but it does what it does and does so relatively well much of the time. But you're probably better off knowing what you're getting into. ** "
B006TA764S This movie had real potential but lost its way along the way and the reveal was predictable by way of the build up. But it was entertaining most of the time."
B006TA764S A very interesting mix of genres that culminates in a climax that I'm still scratching my head over. Think hitmen, a decent into darkness, and the wicker man (the good one, not the Nic Cage movie). Give it a watch. The brit accents can be a little thick at times and I wish there was a subtitle option, but most people will be able to weather through it and gradually get the cadence. I liked it, but I was left with many many questions."
B006TA764S I could watch this movie three more times and still not understand it, no, I don't think I could ever understand it."
B006TA764S I'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year. If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower, mix more genres, and be a bigger waste of time, then this film will be right up your alley. It's the kind of film that makes me rethink people's recommendations because if they liked this then we're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time."
B006TA764S I will not say anything but this about this amazingly written story. It is a sort of action drama and a horror film. Definitely see this one, one of the best of the year. I promise you will not be dissapointed."
B006TA764S This is an independent horror drama from director and writer Ben Wheatley who has worked with comedians Steve Coogan and Jonny Vegas in the past, but this one does not have a foot in the realm of comedy. It is about two old army buddies, who decided to become hit men after their country no longer needed them. We join Jay (Neil Marshall) a year after a bungled job in Kiev. His acerbic wife Shell (played with brilliant complexity by MyAnna Buring) tells him all their money is gone, as he has not done any `work' for a year. He meanwhile only wants to cure his back in their hot tub; she insists he is making it all up and there is nothing wrong with him.Then his old mucker turns up, Gal (Michael Smiley). They are having a dinner party and Gal has brought his latest flame Fiona, a mysterious one indeed who seems to enjoy pentangle like symbols. Well after a mass row, Gal invites Jay to go back to work. They agree and set off to meet their client. He gives them a hit list that includes a priest a librarian and an MP. They are not told their crimes and so Jay lets his imagination fill in the blanks. He is still traumatised from past experiences and seems to find some form of mental rehabilitation through inflicting violence. This he goes at with some very worrying gusto indeed.What unfolds gets darker and darker as the violence escalates and things are seen in their true light. This is one from the school of seventies horror with a sort of cross between the classic `The Wicker Man'and Peter Fonda's lost classic `Race with the Devil' . There is plenty of disturbing violence, language that a docker would baulk at and some brilliantly tense scenes. The soundtrack works too, even though at first I felt it was trying to be too spooky with echoey voices all over the place. By the end you will not notice as everything coalesces to a climax that kept me guessing.Not a straight forward horror as there is a lot of life drama too and some exploration of the mental luggage that people acquire who have been in stressful situations. All of the acting was above par and a lot is left unexplained, in that you automatically fill in the gaps. I actually thought this was really good. Also a note on funding, this was a collaboration with the UK Film Council and Channel 4 who should be praised for their involvement, it's a shame the Council is being abolished. If you like the new wave of Brit horrors then this is up there with the better ones."
B006TA764S It was an interesting movie.  Very off beat.  Make no mistake it is a horror movie and a little sick and twisted.  I had read the description and its not a film about paranoia or anything like that.  I don't want to ruin the movie for others so I won't give away the story. But, you'll need a strong stomach for this one and in the end you may still shake your head.  I gave it three stars because it is so unusual.  It was not my type of movie due to the nature of the film.  Family drama?  Really?"
B006TA764S SPOILERS:An unusual mixture of genres, \"Kill List\" is a moody film about a hitman who takes on a series of assignments where each of those that he kills thanks him and tell him it was an honor. This, needless to say, is disquieting to our hitman who gradually realizes his assignment has some surreal turns to it.\"Kill List\" is an ambitious, moody and, sometimes meandering, thriller that combines the genre with horror as it takes a left turn into territory of \"The Wicker Man\". \"Kill List\" isn't for everyone but it is a pretty powerful film from director Ben Wheatley who tends to take material that could be conventionally explored and give it a unique twist.END OF SPOILERS:I enjoyed \"Kill List\" but this moody thriller may not be for everyone as it's not a straight forward, easy to digest or explain mixture of thriller and horror film that crosses two genres quite effectively.The special features who purchase the blu-ray (as opposed to renting the title but I would suggest a rental first to see if this appeals to you) are commentary track by the director, a second commentary track featuring the two leads,and interviews with the cast and director discussing the making of the film.Unconventional to say the least, \"Kill List\" is a moody thriller that builds its tension. If you're looking for a more traditional Hollywood style thriller, \"Kill List\" is probably not for you but, if you're looking for a challenging, interesting thriller with an unconventional mixture of genres you might find yourself ready for the \"Kill List\"."
B006U3MY7S Everyone loves Dog! Its a very addicting show and a much watch :) Lots of action and adventure in this reality show!"
B006U3MY7S Watch Dog and his family, get the bad guys.  I just like how he interacts with the criminals he picks up.  If you don't mind some racy outfits and a few cuss words, then let the kids watch too!"
B006U3MY7S Having only watched a few episodes when tuning into cable, the wife and I binged on this and enjoyed the mayhem.  You probably will as well.  Especially if you liked Cops on Fox."
B006U3MY7S love this show and especially the characters.  I like the great message Dog and Beth always share and it is fun to watch"
B006U3MY7S This show gives an insight into what bounty hunters go through to capture fugitives. Some of the episodes are quite entertaining."
B006U3MY7S Gotta love it. Love when they get done swearing and calling each other names, then ok, lets pray. Truly a great show."
B006U3MY7S I just like to listen to the theme song and then i turn it off. if you have seen three episodes you have seen enough."
B006U3MY7S Prime ( free episodes ) is  only  on the ones I have seen but at least the sounds works. At least it's a step in the right direction."
B006U3MY7S Reality TV is supposed to bring the \"real world\" to TV.  If this program represents reality, give me fantasy any time. Here we have \"Dog\" and his minions prancing around in all their police/military style paraphernalia, followed by a TV crew and they are supposed to be \"sneaking up\" on some residence. Why not just get the local high school band out and really announce your presence in style? But then again, with the outfit Dog is wearing, perhaps the band would be wasted. Honestly, he looks like a worn out old guy who works Fremont Street in Vegas, charging for tourists to have their photograph taken with him.  Ok, so they find a car (a Sebring we are told many times) and we are besieged with shot after shot of each of the \"team\" in turn having a look through the car window. Now isn't that really exciting?  And if we are not seeing shots of someone looking through the window of the car, we are continually confronted with shots of Dog's wife's legs and her stiletto shoes. Now that is not a pretty sight.Yes, I am sure (from reading some of the other reviews) that there are people who really like the show.  But from what I have seen, this program is certainly not \"reality\", it is definitely not entertainment and it is absolutely not worth watching. The best thing that has happened is that this show has finally been \"pulled\"."
B006U3MY7S While the content of the series is exciting to watch and the family is charismatic, their choice of language (even though semi-tweeted out) is a bit disheartening.  Running through neighborhoods of young children yelling the filthy language just isn't appealing to me."
B006U3MY7S I love the end- the way leland smiled at his beaufiful little girl and she smiled back . that is priceless.  And it was one of the better shows :)"
B006UAWH2S This film is slow but it is meant to be because it is an elegy to the loss of the senses, one by one.  Two beautiful people fall in love when this begins worldwide,  The order of loss is smell, taste, hearing, vision.  The beautiful thing this film does is that as each sense is loss there is a renewed but brief celebration of the sense or senses left. The world is also ending.  There is no reason discernible for any of this,This is one of many end of the world films or books which have come forth in the some number in the last few years,  There seems to be almost no interest in depicting us being overtaken by aliens and sent to oblivion by them. No, this is the end of our world on earth as given by each writer's take on now it will occur,  Although the woman is a doctor working in illness outbreak, she is unable to prove that this is any dissease.Another clever aspect is that each loss is preceded by some wild emotional outburst.  The smell one is preceded by fits of sobbing.  The hearing one starts with a fit of rage.  I found it fascinating that an avalanche of emotion heralded each loss.This film grows on you,  The first twenty minutes passes very, very slowly but if you stick with it, you will find yourself pulled into it.As an added benefit, Ewan McGregor and Eva Green in the lead roles, have to be two of the most gorgeous people on the planet.  Louis CK recently did a comedy act where he said that he'd been a heterosexual all of his forty plus years.  However, he recently met Ewan MacGregor and found himself just mesmerized by how beautiful he was.  Finally he concluded that even he could turn gay briefly if it meant he could have Ewan!I think the movie is great if you can hang in there through the very slow start."
B006UAWH2S Perfect Sense is perfectly awful. It's about a chef (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist (Eva Green), two people who go for each other but who have major relationship problems. They find themselves in the middle of a worldwide epidemic -- after crying a bit people lose their sense of smell. Then taste. Then hearing. Then sight.What can the world do? What can humanity do? What can Michael and Susan do? The answer, my friend, is written by a deeply earnest screenwriter and filmed by an otherwise interesting director: Love each other...take care of each other...trust each other. All this is accompanied with a deeply serious voice over that makes sure we understand the importance of what we see, along with a music score that drips with tragedy and then hope.To watch an infinitely better movie by the same director and also  starring Ewan McGregor, try the excellent and unpleasant Young Adam."
B006UAWH2S Say this much for the Brits they sure know how to make great Armageddon movies i.e \"Twenty Eight Days Later\" and \"Shaun of the Dead\".  \"Perfect Sense\" works for the most part but doesn't quite hit it out of the ballpark.  Where it is most successful is in portraying the world breaking down.  Director David MacKenzie probably didn't have the resources of your typical Hollywood disaster pic but he successfully melds scenes of his own creation with news footage to create a society in chaos.  Where the film falls short is in its central conceit of the world falling deeper into the abyss as the passion between the central lovers(Ewan McGregor and Eva Green) intensifies.  Are these events the result of the lovers actions or despite them?  The film, to me, doesn't give a satisfactory answer.  This is no fault of McGregor and Green whose scenes together have a charged eroticism.  Ultimately, though, \"Perfect Sense\" is an interesting film that falls short of greatness."
B006UAWH2S Presently, science fiction is undergoing a bit of a renaissance in theatres.  There's been a trend for a number of years now to produce films which have stronger ties of very human messages.  With motion pictures like DISTRICT 9, MONSTERS, CLOVERFIELD, and even 2011's BATTLE: LOS ANGELES, writers and directors have been spinning tales about the increasing human cost to our sci-fi encounters with the unknown.  Some of them have focused more heavily on the action quotient, but, by these films' conclusions, there has been ample analysis of the risks to the `regular folks' when faced with the unknown, may it take the shape of aliens, monsters, or other organisms.  PERFECT SENSE continues in this same mold, upping the stakes for individuals.  This time around, it isn't aliens we're facing.  Instead, it's an inescapable virus.Two self-possessed young professionals - a gourmet chef (Ewan McGregor) and a epidemiologist (Eva Green) - find one another at the most trying time in human history: mankind is falling victim to a mysterious plague that robs us of our senses - one by one.  Can a cure for what ails them - the plague or their own narcissism - reach them in time?I won't spoil it, but I will say that PERFECT SENSE is a perfect winner of a film.  Its narration bobs and weaves back and forth between the standard linear - think any other story - and the documentary - scenes and images captured from the greater world at large.  The more we get to know our two principles, the more that's stripped away from them, only forcing us to understand them even more as they collectively lose their sense of smell, then taste, then hearing.  It's as much a cautionary tale as it is an old school romance - boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but aren't they fated to find one another again? - is the best possible sense.  McGregor and Green's performances are comfortable and measured, especially when they're at the weakest - be it having one more layer of their humanity whisked away from them or when they're lost in one another's arms.  It's tragic and meaningful - sharp and resourceful - and, if you take it all to heart, you'll definitely come away with a tremendous appreciation for what smart science fiction looks like in the modern age.PERFECT SENSE is a product of IFC FILMS and BBC FILMS with participation from Zentropa Entertainments 5, the Danish Film Institute, Film I Vast, Bord Scannan Na Heireann / the Irish Film Board, and Sigma Films.  The script is from Kim Fupzaakeson, and it's directed with great attention to detail by David Mackenzie.  It all looks and sounds grand here, though I'll admit that I had to crank the volume quite a way up through part of Green's narrated voiceovers; I don't know if it was a fault of the original recording track or the fact that perhaps it was mixed noticeably lower than the rest of the piece.  Sadly, the disc only contains two features - a making-of short (2 minutes long?) and the trailer - and I would've definitely loved to have much, much more by way of commentaries and longer documentaries, giving more insight into this very special film.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  Poignant and relevant, PERFECT SENSE will challenge you to think about your life and the greater world around you in ways you may never have before, and it just might have you clinging to that special someone, lingering a few extra moments in her embrace or her scent if for no other reason than for it to remain fresh in your mind.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD screener copy of PERFECT SENSE for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B006UAWH2S Susan is a scientist who lives in her own little world, her entire life is devoted to research, while everything else is neglected. For Susan, it was all work and no play, until she meets Michael. A talented scientist meets a talented chef, and the sizzling romance begins. As one would expect, Susan's life begins to change, but so does the entire world she lives in. The more steamy the relationship, the more a new epidemic spreads. As the couple fall in love and share their feelings, people all around lose their sensory perception. As the romance become intense, the mysterious disease becomes more disturbing. The outcome is global chaos as the mystery continues. \"PERFECT SENSE\" is brilliant, powerful, romantic, and chilling. The acting is superb, and the story is both touching and thrilling. Highly recommended for romantic suspense lovers and thriller loves."
B006UAWH2S There are interesting ideas in \"Sense,\" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing.  Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing.  Pressed to find a category in which to put \"Sense,\" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one.  I think what \"Perfect Sense\" might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go, which is in every way better than \"Perfect Sense.\"  If you haven't seen \"Never Let Me Go\" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with \"Never.\"  (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than \"Perfect Sense\"--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)"
B006UAWH2S Confession: I will view nearly any film, no matter how badly done, with apocalyptic themes. Most are way over the top, even for an admittedly over the top, end of world genre.But Perfect Sense transcends the form and surprised me. It WON'T be for you if non-stop gore, suspense, and action are what you crave.This lovely film is as much a meditation about being human as it is a call to wake up and appreciate what we have. These messages arrive in a story about a strange illness. Symptoms include waves of sadness, followed by the loss of smell..and then other symptoms.Perhaps \"perfect sense\" consists of coming to our senses before we truly lose them - or, at least, that is a major point I took away from this movie.Besides the epidemic, there is also a love story, a tumultuous attraction between a chef, Michael, and Susan, an epidemiologist. Their chemistry didn't quite click for me but this didn't take much away from the rest of the film. There is just so much worth pondering.I am grateful that so many of the usual and easy themes were omitted: no religious cause for the virus, no clear medical analysis. Viewers have to take events as they come and draw their own conclusions rather than being beaten over the head with a MAJOR POINT or PROFOUND MESSAGE."
B006UAWH2S There doesn't seem to be any shortage of end of the world films these days.  Add this Euro (Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and Scotland) collaboration to the mix.  Don't look for alien invaders from another galaxy or robotic killers or even interplanetary collisions however.Set in Glasgow, scientists have discovered that a group of people are, for some unknown reason, losing their sense of smell.  The disease, presumed to be viral, spreads quickly worldwide.  What is even more unusual is that just before the ability to smell ceases, the victims go through a psychological change.  In this case, uncontrollable grief along with incessant sobbing.  Once that period ends the ability to smell goes as well.Eva Green plays Susan, an epidemiologist who is working on the identification process.  Her apartment overlooks the back door of an upscale restaurant where Michael (Ewan McGregor) is the chef.  Both are coming off badly ended relationships, but of course manage to hook-up.  What do you expect, they're both great looking.  While their relationship becomes hotter, so does the virus.  One by one, new psychological symptoms arrive with increasingly devastating effects.  The movie is far from perfect as some of the scenes seem out of context.  For example, even without a sense of taste, I doubt I'd want to be ingesting soap and shaving cream just for a few bathtub chuckles.Although the movie has sadness about it and a bleak forecast, Susan and Michael's love story is both erotic and hopeful.  Certainly a thinking person's sci-fi.  Recommended.The Blu ray disc has little to offer in terms of extras.  The transfer has a 2.34:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the original print and is of course 1080p.  While the picture isn't reference quality it is likely close to the original.  Several scenes appear to be stock newsreel footage in standard definition.  I believe this was shot with digital cameras.  Some scenes look a little dark b
B006UAWH2S it was a bit strange of a perspective,  so definitely see this as a cult movie, or a niche taste."
B006UAWH2S Of all the movies that I have viewed this year, this one has to be up there with the best. The amazing direction of David Mackenzie, the lulling and mournful soundtrack by Max Richter and the photography by Giles Nuttgens (both beautiful and distressing combined) pull a metaphorical statement from beginning to end.Michael (Ewan McGregor) is an executive chef who meets Susan (Eva Green), a saddened epidemiologist, after she returns home from examining a patient with a very disturbing affliction.  Inexplicable, as he suddenly lost his sense of smell for no apparent reason.  This continues on to several other people at first then runs amok.These two begin an intimate relationship quite rapidly, as everything in this movie happens quickly and without warning with one exception: each person will fall into a severe emotional occurrence previous to losing their ability to smell.Susan and her team give it the name 'Severe Olfactory Syndrome' (SOS) as it reaches epidemic proportions and spreads world wide.  There are no explanations given as there is no time, therefore one must think on their own of how, why or what is happening.  The movie heavily affects your time in reacting.  It causes suspenseful anxiety to build readily and rapidly as you are left questioning the reasons why.The erotic relationship between Michael and Susan hardly gets a chance to develop, as the rapid-fire affliction follows into another sense (taste) and similarly eradicates it.  Michael is 'affected' and this is devastating to his career as is Susan affected also.  The couple is growing more and more dependent on each other as the happenings around them are mercurial and deconstructing.The symptoms preceding the loss of the senses are bewildering, wonder-struck and deeply disturbing.  People are losing control, panicking  and literally start unstoppable eating of anything and everything (from lipstick to things you have got to see for yourself).  The photography and camera angles get increasingly confusing while bringing this chaos to life; it is all out catastrophic.People are running wild, rioting in the streets as everything is unsafe and sickness is omnipresent.  There is so much to this movie that I wouldn't want to go on with the plot any longer as I would hate to ruin anyone's response to this movie...and your response itself is everything.Running amid the course of the film are short plugged in narratives that work well.  They serve to make you think, as this is a frightening portrait of annihilation in a very different form.When someone loses one of their senses, it is usually just that one and devastating enough alone.  The ending of this movie presents a whole alternative view to this, as tomorrow is no guarantee and \"gather ye rosebuds while ye may\"."
B006UAWH2S A story about virus that takes away your senses seems a little corny perhaps but this film is anything but that. It has great performances from both leads and some great cinematography. I don't think the film had a big budget but you can't tell as they used their money very well to make a great atmospheric film. You can feel the depression in every frame as society tries to cope as they lose their senses one by one. The main love story between Eva Green and Ewen Mcgregor is well done and realistic. It's not the corny type love affair in some films. It feels real and natural and the two have great chemistry on screen. The ending may not please all but I thought it was a brilliant closing scene. I find myself thinking about the film far after I watched it which is quite rare for me. I recommend this to fans of either apocalyptic end of the world or romance dramas as it is equal parts both."
B006UAWH2S \"I think it's OK to panic now.\" A very serious disease strain has begun to cause havoc all over the world and it's called severe olfactory syndrome (SOS). It begins by smelling something that reminds you of someone you know who has died, then one by one you begin to lose your senses. During the outbreak chef Michael (McGregor) and scientist Susan (Green) begin to fall in love and their relationship is tested over and over as their senses begin to fail. Even the the plot may sound a little hokey this is actually a very good movie. At once the movie is both disturbing and sweet as well as erotic. The acting is fantastic as you believe that they are really losing their senses and you really begin to feel bad for them. To me this is a little scary because it makes me wonder if this could actually happen (from some chemical) and how I would act. This movie will give you hope and break your heart at the same time. I recommend this but it is a movie that will leave you worn out and not really in the mood to do anything after. Overall, a very good movie that is both disturbing and wonderful. I give it a B+."
B006UAWH2S Set in Glasgow, \"Perfect Sense\" follows the story of a chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist Susan (Eva Green) falling in love with other just when a strange epidemic spreads all over the world, depriving the people of the sense of smell. Things don't stop there, but people are resilient, as the film's voiceover says, \"life goes on.\"This is a sci-fi romance with an unusual premise, or a modern-day parable beautifully-shot and well-acted, with a positive message about life, something that is also thought-provoking ... if you can ignore the film's pretentious and manipulative narrative.While director David Mackenzie manages to visualize the impending apocalypse effectively with minimum use of props, there is something artificial about the way the whole story is told. What if you lose your sense of smell? Pretty early on you will know where the film is trying to lead us to. \"Perfect Sense\" certainly does what it sets out to do confidently, even though I really don't care what is going on in this alternative universe of the emotionally distant film.Like some art house movies, \"Perfect Sense\" makes a point of showing what is obvious in a novel way."
B006UAWH2S Imagine losing your senses one by one, how terrifying it would be, and the repercussions of not having the sense of smell, taste, hearing, and sight.  That is the epidemic depicted in this existential horror/dystopian film, where many, if not all, people in the world are afflicted.  We focus on the relationship between an epidemiologist and a chef who are both infected and go through the rigors of the illness with each other.  There is no explanation of what causes the problem, which adds to the tension."
B006UAWH2S PLOT SPOILER ALERT!I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Is this depressing film an apocalyptic fable, or a cautionary tale, or \"when the world comes to an end, you still have each other and your love\"?  Perhaps the first two, definitely not the last \"love\" scenario. As far as leaving the theater and being filled with life, someone spiked your Pepsi.If the director & writer were intending to do a somewhat realistic film, and not a fantasy, then they failed.  They have given us a virus that first knocks out your sense of smell, then taste, then hearing, then sight, and finally (not shown in the film) your sense of touch.  \"Love\" as an outward display of affection, is non-existent in a world where you cannot smell, taste, hear, see, or touch the one you love.  It is not the \"Perfect Sense\", it is not even a sense.  What is left is a feeling/emotion called \"love\" that was derived from the senses, and absent the five senses becomes a memory.The logical conclusion of this movie is that the human population becomes extinct.  Each person dies because of starvation or suicide, alone -- probably in fear.  After that, there is not even the memory of \"love\" on this planet.  The only way our two protagonists could have ended this tragic movie with \"love\", was if -- while they still had their sense of touch -- they took cyanide and hugged and kissed good-bye.I gave this film 3 stars because Ava Green is worth watching in any film.  She does her best acting when she has no make-up on.  (Bet you thought I was going to say something else.)This is not a film you will watch more than once."
B006UAWH2S This is a apocalyptic movie about a strange virus that is destroying the senses of humans one by one. However, humans quickly adapt and move on with their everyday life.Eva Green is absolutely fantastic (as a statistician working in an hospital) in her role like in all movies that she appeared (Cracks is my favorite for the moment). I wish she would appear in more movies.While many people may not like the movie, from a scientific point it makes sense that a virus can and may be one day infect a particular cell population in the brain that is responsible for our senses.We have officially five senses: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. It is quite amazing how the movie demonstrates the adaptability of humans. Once a sense disappears, after a few weeks of panic, people adapt and move on with their life. That is probably the best part of the movie, beside the love story between Eva Green and Ewan McGregor.The movie is well done and while it is focusing on the two love birds, we get the message of adaptability.Without being a spoiler, four of the senses disappear during the movie and the one not gone by the time the movie is over (touch) is the most intriguing of all. Once I got into the movie, I was expecting to see what would be the consequences of losing the touch feeling. We will never know since the movie doesn't tell us but we can guess many different scenarios.Great movie, five stars all around for everything!"
B006UJVOPA I like the saltiness of Vera and the fact she isn't a skinny, young blond!  Her sidekick supplies the eye candy and the gentleness that is lacking in Vera's character.  Definitely worth watching."
B006UJVOPA The name and photo for the program kept me from watching it. Glad I got past it. Love the plots and twists and turns. Good character development. Beautiful cinematography of the landscapes. Makes me want to go there."
B006UJVOPA I absolutely can't get enough of the Vera series and hope it continues for a long, long time. I first found it on _____ and had a wonderful marathon, have since found more series here on Amazon Prime - yay!For those of us who love quiet escapism, this is a series for us. Dark, moody, atmospheric, soulful bits of music enhance scenes (rather than overpowering to compensate for a lack of content). Beautifully well done._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Oh my gosh, for those of you who dislike dark, moody and atmospheric, stay away from the fabulously dark and wet set-in-Seattle series: The Killing - it's FABULOUS for those attributes! I have no self control and sat and watched an entire season in two days and now have to wait a whole year until they produce the third season - aughh. Oh, well...I can always watch again starting from Season 1, Episode 1 - it's a twisty, turny I-KNOW-who-did-it, but aha! - I never do!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I live in the US and here are some of the British series I watch with a delighted eye for the extra added bonus of VISUAL CONTENT of countryside, village life, clothing, decor, lifestyle, just plain charm (aside from, or in addition to actual story, characters or content) I'm not one who goes for the opulent high class loads of money castles, etc. unless they're land rich, cash poor old manors slightly dilapidated and interesting:Poirot: Very clean, stark and precise Art Deco - a totally different feel from my other favorites, but just as enjoyable visually - excellent attention to detail!Midsomer Murders has mostly beautiful, blue skies with high white clouds, rolling green fields, absolutely charming cottages and villages. So many places I'd love to see in person. [Unfortunately, I can't stand the characters of Tom's whiny wife and smug daughter.] Light series despite all the murders and boy howdy there are many, lol! I also love the long length of these.Doc Martin: beautiful, seaside village life! Blue skies, green hills and fields, narrow lanes, delightful cottages and short ceilinged century old houses. I want to live there.Ballykissangel: same as above and I want to live there, too. Cute little old, old, old, cottages."
B006UJVOPA who manages to solve crimes in her own way. Nevertheless, she gets the job done with few outbreaks of bossiness and a staff that seems to respect her methods."
B006UJVOPA Pay attention while watching this one. The pace seems slow at first, but moves along. Hope Netflix adds Season 2."
B006UJVOPA I love this series.  She's different - emotional, but doesn't want anyone to know it  Her assistant is absolutely delicious.  He deals with her well.  I want to see more of her."
B006UJVOPA Just wished there were more to watch.  I have always liked Brenda Blethyn.  British detective and mysteries are my favorite .  I saw season 1 on PBS so I had to watch it again."
B006UJVOPA WHAT AN AWESOME SHOW!!! I LOVE British drama series...AND THIS SHOW  IS IT! IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING."
B006UJVOPA As an American, there is more about British culture that I don't totally get than I would have thought.  Of course I have no idea how &#34;real&#34; this show is, but it is fascinating to watch - to observe the differences.  Characters are well developed, and brilliantly acted.  The mysteries keep you guessing.  What more could you ask for?"
B006UJVOPA There is always a twist.  Vera is a dogmatic inspector with a very sharp brain.  I anxiously anticipate Season 3."
B006UJVOPA I enjoyed these stories and Vera's wry sense of humor.  Please continue with Season two for me to enjoy soon."
B006UJVOPA I Love British detective stories and Vera is very real. Her emotions are all over the place and she does remind me of Colombo. The cast is great and I like all of it."
B006UJVOPA I'm hooked.  Vera is so quirky you never know what she'll say next.  She has a hunk of a side kick, the scenery is amazing and the whole thing is done very well."
B006UJVOPA This program is ok but too slow moving for me.  I thought it was a waste of my time watching Vera when I could be watching something else."
B006UJVOPA A 50-something woman detective takes charge in this series. The accent is a bit difficult, so you might wish to turn on Closed Captioning. A delightful change from the young, virile copper, although no where near as easy on the eyes!"
B006UJVOPA I like that you cannot predict what's going to happen next, nor how the story will end. Interesting characters, not the 'made in the mould' cops like so many shows. The characters here have admirable qualities and rough edges at the same time, just like real people do. I really like Brenda Blethyn as Vera. She is excellent."
B006UJVOPA now that she has a good group the dci will be able to solve any case that comes along  enjoy"
B006UJVOPA This may be a promising, interesting series but the accents are so pronounced, it is irritating to try to watch since I don't understand half of what is said....not a good idea on series needing to figure &#34;who dun it!&#34;"
B006UJVOPA Good show, worth watching particularly if you come from the northeast of England because you see some places you have never seen before...well I did!."
B006UJVOPA What I said in season 2, I also mean for season 1. As I said, great mystery with these crimes."
B006UJVOPA What an excellent show where the writers have an ensemble interaction, young and old, down to perfection with acting to fulfill the writing!  Vera and Joe have got it going on in such a bizarre, cantankerous wonderful kinda way with excellent support from Holly and Kennie!"
B006UJVOPA Vera, is down to earth and well written. the only down side is not a lot of episodes, but that is a good thing. I would spend my day watching and not doing much else"
B006UJVOPA Super acting on the part Ms Blethyn as well as those of her co-stars.  Also, the characters were quite convincing."
B006UJVOPA What a fun show.Like someone else said, an English Columbo.The story's are good as are the characters.Enjoy."
B006UJVOPA The only complaint I really had was the difficulty of streaming the first episode.  Brenda Blethyn makes the series.  Even though she tries to remain detached, she simply can't help herself from caring about her staff and those close to the victims.  I would recommend this to mystery lovers and I am definitely left with wanting more!"
B006UJVOPA I've seen Brenda Blethyn in several British films and her ability to absorb herself into her characters is almost frightening.  It would be wonderful to sit down with her to find out what she's really like.  In this series, she is an introverted detective, with almost no people skills except when she's interacting with victims and suspects; then she can be utterly kind, patient and understanding until she's gotten what she needs to solve the crime.  Yet, there is something in the character and the performance that makes you long to understand her.  Some clues as to how she became who is is, are given when she speaks of her distant and difficult father, with whom she had a troubled relationship.  Over the series they seem to be revealing more about her youth.  The mysteries are well done, very much character driven and always contain surprising elements and twists that are frequently based on both victims' and perpetrators' inability to understand and cope with each other, their own desires and life itself.Vera's relationship with her team is also interesting; she can bellow with the best of them, but there is some kindness there when she's reminded that these people are human.  Her relationsip with her her right arm, John, is fascinating.  Initially he cannot get a handle on her personality but when he does he manages to work with her and even understand her.  When Vera attends his daughter's first communion he quietly hands her a gift to give to the child since he knows it simply will not occur to her to do so. In a scene where she has reluctaintly agreed to have dinner with his family, she sits across from his wife and looks so absolutely at sea, totally unable to cope with a simple dinner that it is painful to watch and she abruptly ends the meal and leaves; stunning acting.  Lovely, well done complex stories and I hope to see more."
B006UJVOPA This is a different kind of detective and I enjoyed the series.  It took a little getting used to her, but she grew on me and the characters grow, too"
B006UJVOPA Really enjoyed this show.  Vera is a believable character.I was hooked after the first episode.  Her partner is also a good character."
B006UJVOPA I'm enjoying the stories and the acting is good.  It is a bit hard to understand the accent and follow what's going on at times.  But, I do look forward to watching more of this season.  It's nice to see a series that is more about solving the mystery of the case than about sex appeal.  Also nice that there is no vulgar language.  I love the main character, Vera."
B006UJVOPA I love almost all detective stories, I enjoyed all of the Vera series..better than reading a book. Wish there were more like this."
B006UJVOPA Love Vera and all her flaws.  She manages to pursue and persist until she is on the right track and solves the mystery with the help of her co-workers.  Stories are not cookie cutter but the theme is original and well written."
B006UJVOPA It is not so easy to successfully create thrillers then an entire series around a frumpy middle aged woman detective who is frequently in a bad mood. However the Brits score once again, and I think that is why we are so deeply drawn into this series - we can identify with characters who are normal, have issues and are not glammed up.As Vera Stanhope, Brenda Blethyn is superb--she's a woman with little private life, obsessed by her work, and often very hard on her subordinates -and yet underneath all her spikiness, she has a great deal of feeling and compassion. Additionally the Northumbrian setting provides a moody cloud filled change from the usual urban grit or typically bucolic English village.The episodes themselves are fascinating--topical, character driven and complex without the over the top guns, chases and bravado of much American television programming. I read that series three has already aired in Britain and series four is being filmed. I can hardly wait."
B006UJVOPA Season 1 is very consistent in its characterization and drama; well written series. I enjoy Vera because she is so OCD; a difficult woman with a difficult past who finds loving and forgiving very difficult. Her relationship with Joe, her sergeant is more clear in the second season as Joe's family is brought into the drama. For now, Joe is a forever forgiving, over-worked father of a young family who is trying desperately to keep up with his irritating boss.  Delightful"
B006UJVOPA Vera is doggedly determined to find answers but doesn't know how to manage people.  Maybe that's because she has so many worries of her own that she won't share with anyone.  All of the officers - even the quiet ones - impact the show.  The countryside is beautiful and the evil is truly human evil.  Hope to find more of Brenda Blethyn's shows."
B006UJVOPA Though it was interesting was a little confusing, bounced around too much, hard to keep up an interest in the story"
B006UJVOPA The characters are complex, the stories unpredictable: everything you want in a good mystery series!  There are layers of story lines going on in each episode with natural dialogue and excellent actors."
B006UJVOPA the fact us that many homicide detectives are in fact overweight. they eat a lot due to the horror of their job.  Vera is also having health problems and the stress of her job  , is  ready to boil up. She explodes a lot ,but she cares and everyone that works for her knows it and respect her even if she is a hard person to work for. She also lets her emotions boil up in stressful situations. But she gets the job done. And the first season has four well done episodes. Each over a hour long. We need a show like this , as much as I love csi and such , this dogged detective work is  what most detectives have to go through.  This is a great show and it's a drama , with little action but that's ok. the picture looks great, in hd.  I don't think it's out on dvd yet in the states, but it's getting more and more fans  , so it will probably happen."
B006UJVOPA We caught 'Vera' merely by chance when scrolling for something decent to watch. Since we are avid Brenda Blethyn fans, we knew it had to be good, and we certainly were not disappointed. She is so very good at the dry/droll/snarky quips...hard to beat 'Vera' for great entertainment!"
B006UJVOPA I really like the stories and the actors are a great ensemble cast.  The writing is creative and Vera played by Brenda Blethyn is entertaining.  A nice detective story that you can involve yourself in.  Vera can get a little on your nerves and she over acts at times, but the actor David Leon has just the right touch to ground the show and bring it back into reality.  Loved both seasons."
B006UJVOPA I really enjoyed this series! Just enough personal interaction to make the show work. Even though one member of the cast changed, the show still went on with the usual great acting. I would recommend you watch it!"
B006UJVOPA Nothing really wrong with this show it just didn't really keep my attention.  I think I started doing something else before it finished."
B006UJVOPA Only watched one episode but it was good.  Just haven't gotten around to watching more.  &#34;Vera&#34; is a bit of a selfish character but she gets the job done."
B006UJVOPA Fabulous acting.  I forgot where I was, enthralled by great acting, story line and wonderful scenes of England.  Highly recommend the series.  Wish there were more seasons to watch.  Please.  Please."
B006UJVOPA I enjoyed this series very much. It was a welcome change from the rough and tumble series I just completed (The Commander-it was also very good). The setting and soundtrack was pleasing - I was almost transported! I loved how the lead was a bit of a grumblely-gus and everyone fawned for her approval. A welcome change having a woman in a role where she bucked norms of this genre."
B006UJVOPA The stories aren't bad, its the principal character that's the pain.  Granted it is season 1 and everyone is trying to find their feet.But, Vera is bad tempered all the time and borderline abusive.  The series is as much to do about Vera and her quirks as it is thesolving of crime.  If you like police stories where the DCI is a misery guts, then this is for you.  I prefer my stories with a lot more class like &#34;Lewis&#34;.  You can't go wrong with &#34;Lewis&#34;!"
B006UJVOPA Blethyn's characterization is marvelous as a down-to-earth, sometimes cranky detective with little life outside her job. The accents are sometimes hard to decipher, but watch this enough and they'll clarify; even when I was struggling with the individual words, I loved the melodic sounds. Good mysteries, very enjoyable."
B006UJVOPA I like this series.  It is quite different from the usual British detective series.  Vera is quirky, smart, and not at all glamorous, but she is relentless in crime solving.  A  refreshing,satisfying series."
B006UJVOPA I love Brenda Blethyn in this part. He character's behavior is odd, but intriguing. You get to know the characters and their issues as the stories develop. I like that this mystery series is about the mystery and not just the action, although there is some action in the stories.."
B006UJVOPA I liked Vera because she's unglamorous and real.  I like her working relationship with Sgt. Joe, who seems to be a devoted family man.  Vera is tough and cynical, but really cares about &#34;her&#34; victims.  The dialogue is a little difficult to understand for an American, but I listened closely and enjoyed the mystery."
B006UJVOPA The characters and setting for the show are fabulous. The scenery is beautiful and the intensity of each episode is gripping. Great watch!"
B006UJVOPA I am looking forward to more of the back story of the character Vera.  Well acted and well written. There is a great contrast between the ugly crimes being investigated and beautiful scenery."
B006UJVOPA This is a superb who-done-it type show.  The outdoor views are unique and beautiful.  There's just enough curiosity about the main characters to make you care about them.  It's very high quality that you're likely to enjoy."
B006UJVOPA This woman is an unlikely lead in a series, but delightful to watch in all her complexities.  An interesting series that combines the sensitive with the humorous.  Well worth watching."
B006UJVOPA Quite a good show - love the personalities and how they interplay --- just wish there were more seasons and more episodes."
B006V644AO It keeps my three year old daughter's attention.  She loves the action and she actually follows along with their adventures with no problem."
B006V644AO I choose this rating because my grandson learnedSo much from team oomizoomi. Shapes, counting,And one to one correspondence(educational term)I forgot pattern. My other grandson watched team oomizoomiAnd is at the top of his class in math. It makes math fun."
B006V644AO My 2 year old loves this little group and I love its educational aspect. This is her favorite episode and we wanted to have it on the Kindle anytime."
B006V644AO I don't like it but the kids do and they learn to find things or put things together or count. it's just annoying to me. the voices, the characters especially door mouse who is always negative."
B006V644AO This cartoon is so much fun to watch.  My grandchild enjoys the 'plot', music, colors, shapes, and the business of the characters!  It's entertaining and a good learning tool for shapes, designs/colors, and measurements for toddlers.  Strongly recommend it, you won't regret purchasing it for your child or children."
B006V644AO We bought a few favorite episodes and will probably buy the season when it comes out in full. We often use them traveling and sometimes at home. The show has been great. She has learned ALL her shapes and numbers from it. How many almost 2 year olds know a trapezoid when the see it? Or how to count to 100 by ones AND tens? The only downside is she can have a day when she overstresses about everything (toddler much?) and too many OH NOs from bot and it'll be time to stop it before she cries over nothing."
B006VA3X9I A nice twist on the pawn star series that seems to be all over television. It is amazing how many different ways these guys do business."
B006VA3X9I The owners/employees are entertaining to watch.  They seem like good, genuine folks from down South.  An interesting spin in this show is that many of the customers seem to know the owner, so it adds a much more personal feel to those encounters.  I think that makes this reality show seem even more real.  They buy a good mix of items, from Civil War memorabilia to donkeys to honey.  These shows are best when there is an educational piece in every episode.  You get that with Cajun Pawn Stars.  It's entertaining and educational.  You often see failed negotiations, which I assume is reality on an everyday occasion.  I can appreciate that as much as successful negotiations."
B006VA3X9I Feeling folksy?  If History's smash hit \"Pawn Stars\" is too urbane for you with its Las Vegas setting, you might want to try something with a little more twang.  \"Cajun Pawn Stars\" could be just that program, but I'm not sure if this version has quite the instant appeal.  I know there is a contingent of viewers who love this much more than the original, and I know there are vocal opponents who find this edition far less real and/or compelling.  For myself, I fall somewhere in between.  The show is caught between being a rip-off and a spin-off.  It wants to adhere so closely to the winning formula that defined \"Pawn Stars\" that, especially in early episodes, the drama can seem incredibly forced.  As the season progresses and you get to know the cast, the interactions start to feel more organic--but it's still a show that has yet to find its own voice and viewpoint.Set in Alexandria, Louisiana at the Silver Dollar Pawn and Jewelry Center, the colorful proprietor is Jimmie \"Big Daddy\" DeRamus.  His brother and his daughter are among the other regulars and the show hopes to capitalize on wacky family interactions.  As you might expect, there is much down home humor to be gleaned from Big Daddy, his family, his staff, and those that visit the shop.  Some works, some feels strained.  To me, the star of the show (at least initially) is the massive shop itself that seems to have every manner of merchandise crammed into its corners and crevices.  It would be a fascinating place to visit and poke through, that's for sure.Season One is comprised of 8 episodes on one disc for just shy of three hours worth of total programming.  There are no special features, but the disc offers Spanish and English subtitles.  Here are the included shows:(1) Donkeys and Dollars, (2) Sweet and Sour, (3) Shoeshine Mike, (4) Money Bzzzzness, (5) Joker's Big Score, (6) Trick or Trade, (7) Joker's Wild, and (8) Speed Demons.As I've said, the show seems to have divided people.  You might want to sample an episode on rerun before you buy the season (they are also available on-demand here if you don't have the History Channel).  I love the shop, I haven't fallen in love with the show yet.  It has potential, though, as long as it keeps pushing to establish its own individuality.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006VA3X9I Great variety of items pawned. Hard to believe the money people loose because they want money NOW! You can learn a lot about the history of the South in this one."
B006VA3X9I very good, You feel like going down memory lane. The shows have too be new , repeats do not work...."
B006VA3X9I I love Pawn Stars and we don't get that particular channel where I just moved so I thought I would watch this as a substitute. It is similar but just didn't have the specialness that goes along with their Las Vegas kin."
B006VA3X9I It's still an entertaining show but some of the events seem as though they're scripted somewhat.  Maybe they are actual things that happened but have been scripted to re-enact what happened.  Still worth watching"
B006VA3X9I it,s just like pawn stars but based in the south. It,s funny plus entertaining. It also has that sweet southern flavor"
B006VA3X9I If you like the original pawn stars, you'll love this show. Same classic fun and you get to see lots of interesting items."
B006VA3X9I I assume it only lasted one season as 2012 appears to be the only season available.....it's OK if not a tad hokey."
B006VEFUJA This is show is on par with VH1 Surreal Life in which I had experienced three episodes due to having the flu and not being able to change the channels. People get very dramatic when the camera is present. Include Gold Rush in that same category.Yeah, why watch if I do not enjoy them? The same reason I had to check why traffic is slowing down - to see the accident. Scenics awesome , at least on the episodes I had watched. But no more!Amazon, thank you, for even if these shows are starring the worse actors in the world the picture quality is awesome!"
B006VEFUJA A good show about dangerous jobs with over emotional people."
B006VEFUJA language is an issue here, so not probably suitable for youngsters, but on this show, you never know what's gonna happen next. could be a fist fight, could be a landslide, mechanical failure.... every episode is a &#34;what's gonna happen now&#34; experience."
B006VEFUJA Repetitive. Recovers too much of the ground it just did... This, I assume, is to remind the viewer, where the show left off before the commercials. Of course, on Amazon, there are no commercials, so it's annoying, and a so-called hour long show, already shortened to about 43 minutes, wastes several of those 43 on repeating. This is not unique to this show. Many, originally intended or shown on commercial television, do the same thing. I find it annoying, and feel cheated, that even 43 minutes is not truly 43 minutes of content, but more like 35. As for the show it's self, it makes too much drama out of minor things, and focuses on the squabbles, and seems to relish them. This is not what I want to see. (Too much of that in real life, I watch TV to get AWAY from real life!) The technical aspects of the job being done, however, are enough for me to give 4 stars. Barely."
B006VEFUJA As we began to watch there was interest in the characters and various logging technics. It was the attitude of one boss inparticular that turn us to turning it off. A small big mouth, large temper guy who physically shoved down threatened and also choked co-workers. To serious an occupation for such an immature person. Done watching!"
B006VEFUJA entertaining and interesting tv series, too bad they are not more of them.this is good reality tv, try it."
B006VEFUJA Something about this show that just keeps you coming back for more. Perhaps it's the diverse characters or the subject matter but we find it fascinating."
B006VEFUJA I likem all but the swamp ledginShelby is the best glad he got his own show lol ha ha ha"
B006VEFUJA Heavily contrived but still entertaining. It only requires a willing suspension of disbelief. Having worked both in the woods and in the heavy construction business, it does it for me despite the flaws."
B006VEFUJA Love Shelby and S&S. Get kind of tired of the logging boys fighting all the time. Seems like they create accidents for the show."
B006VJ7TC6 I LOVE that they put Jack (from Bones) in this weeks show! This one was the best yet, great location changes & very entertaining plot! I also really enjoy Willas story, you can tell that she is in love with Timo so I really hope that works out for her in the end, with a lot of cute gypsy love drama in between. As for the show as a whole, its getting better all the time, I have very high hopes for The Finder!"
B006VJ7TC6 This show reminds me of a softer version of Burn Notice. Every episode so far has me looking forward to the next and it's a nice change from all the CSI type shows on TV."
B006VJ7TC6 This is an interesting show. I enjoyed the characters in the show. It is sad that Michael Clark Duncan had departed (deceased) shortly after the cancellation of this show. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this show, which I continued to watch it, repeatedly."
B006VJ7TC6 One of the worse things that happened this past spring is that this show got canceled.  The show had an excellent combination of good acting from all of it's prime characters, interesting story lines, fun, and often a meaningful message. It had romance, sex, adventure, thoughtful interaction among it's characters all presented in a  way that kept me interested from begging to end. My hope is that the producers will find another venue, the show will continue, and it will be advertised widely enough that I can find it."
B006VJ7TC6 this was a good show , however it was doomed after it's 8th episode. That episode featured a idiotic gangsta rap plot. Everyone I know stopped watching after that episode. I tried to convince them that this was a aboration. but to no avail.  There's a lesson here , most adults don't want a episode featuring gang rap plots; and it even featured a murdered rapper. Is there any other kind?  lol.  Oh well this one is no gone for good. The ratings did plummet after that one so that's that. gang rap equals death. well actually it does , just in this case death of a good show."
B006VJ7TC6 Iam sorry that it won't be back but even sorrier that David is no longer with us.  I did enjoy the show, in my opinion they worked well together.."
B006VJ7TC6 I was very happy with The Finder. It was great, no problems at all. Only good things to say. Keep up the great work."
B006VJ7TC6 I watched it when it first came out, and am watching every show again.  Well written, directed and acted - it's the best TV show in recent history.Totally bummed that there was not a season 2."
B006VJ7TC6 GOOD MIX OF A QUIRKY DETECTIVE AND HIS ENTOURAGE OF STRANGE, BUT ENDEARING COLLEAGUES MADE THIS SERIES JUST PLAIN FUN TO WATCH."
B006VJ7TC6 I liked it. My wife didn't. It has some action and a lot of humor that passed her by. But all in all, I hope they come out with another season."
B006VJ7TC6 I LOVE THIS SHOW I WAS HOPING THAT IT WAS NOT CANCEL BUT SINCE I DONT SEE SEASON TWO ON YET IT IS SAD IT WOULD HAVE A MADE A GREAT COMENDY/SERIES SHOW"
B006VJ7TC6 I loved this show for its quirky characters and original plot lines.  Unfortunately the network did not give it enough time to take off as a series.  I watch it on Hulu where it gets great ratings and good reviews.  Loved it because not every story line involved a murder.  This allowed the writers to do new things and introduce some novel characters.  The same thing happened to another great show I was able to catch on Hulu....Endgame.  Why do we get endless receptions of dorky reality TV dreck and so few well written and fun shows like The Finder?  I curse you Network TV for being so short sighted! I hope the Khardasians all have eight kids each and go live on a shrimp boat at your expense."
B006W59O6I Lots of fun to watch, a bit scripted obviously but fun and one of the shippers is from my state making it even more fun to watch.  Great audio and video quality."
B006W59O6I Just another of the reality shows that have little to offer. Ice Road Truckers was fun, at first, because few of us knew about the roads in Alaska and in the Yukon. Too many spin-offs. Boring."
B006W59O6I This is a good show but what ruins it is the scripted dialogue which is unnecessary. Just let the people be themselves and not try to turn them into &#34;actors&#34;."
B006W59O6I Its interesting to see the problems each trucker has to over come and how they go about getting it done."
B006W59O6I Quite an interesting show. I had previously heard of USHIP but only briefly and never thought about what or who would get into such a business."
B006W59O6I This series demonstrated the risks and hard work of the truckers that bid for their work online.  It was painful to see the sacrifices and trading of one's health in this profession.  The intrinsic rewards of getting the job done were significant though."
B006W59O6I We love this show. just goes to show going with the cheapest bid does not always mean the best shipping"
B006W59O6I Great Show, fun to watch them figure it out, cut each others throats and drive all over the country!! Enjoy!"
B006W59O6I The show was interesting, but not compelling.  The stories didn't grab me like some other 'reality' shows do...probably has a great audience among truckers, but in my opinion, not for me."
B006W59O6I Its about a group of different people that bid on different items to ship. Watching some of the stuff they ship is interesting and entertaining."
B006W59O6I This series was a fun look into competitive shipping and logistics. Each character has his or her own story which allows the viewer to feel absolute vile and contempt for some and root for others. I enjoy watching some of the challenging scenarios that are presented and how each character responds."
B006W59O6I I like the way the show works.  A little to much drama sometimes but seeing the things people ship is fun.  Worth a watch just don't take it to much to heart"
B006W59O6I Interesting show, but I could do without the smart-ass comments from the non-winning participants in the middle of the winning bidders run. We all make mistakes and are not perfect, so shut them up."
B006W59O6I The show isn't bad, but it isn't great either. The concept and experience is really interesting of the show, however the use of foul language repeatedly can be excessive and not fun for a family setting."
B006W59O6I Hoping for a few more seasons to appear on &#34;Amazon prime&#34;, but the 10 episodes that are free are entertaining and makes me glad I never decided to go into the shipping business!"
B006W59XOQ This was probably the best season of dance moms out of all of them! The moms were dramatic but not to dramatic and the kids dances were amazing!"
B006W59XOQ It gives me a good laugh to watch the moms behaving badly except Holly.I understand Abby and where she's coming from but she is too abusive toward all the girls. Yes, the real world is tough but they have time to learn that. Right now they need nurturing not abuse at the hands of someone they look up to.It also seems a lot is staged with the moms. If someone doesn't want to talk about an aspect of their private life that's no one else's business. Respect that and leave it alone.It's fun to watch as an Amazon video when I have nothing else to do but I wouldn't watch it as a regular on Lifetime."
B006W59XOQ This show is good i have to admit. It's a guilty pleasure for me, but i really do enjoy watching it. I wish more season 3 were on there. but other that that, i Like it"
B006W59XOQ Sorry, just didn't care much for this one.  Truthfully didn't watch all of it.  A complete wast of time, absolutely nothing there."
B006W59XOQ Seeing what these amazing kids do is great. Watching the stupid moms 2nd guess the expert they pay to teach their children is boring.  This mindless conversation however is truly overshadowed by the talent and tenacity of the kids.  The kids are sadly victims of their mothers insecurity and pride. Listen to Abby and see your kid do their best."
B006W59XOQ It's like watching a train wreck, so much fighting and back biting but yet you want to find out.  The girls and mothers have a really large wardrobe, I don't think I've seen the same outfit twice.  Really talented dancers especially for their age."
B006W59XOQ This is one of those shows that you find yourself talking to the television because you can't believe those mothers would let their kids be talked to that way but then you remember, it is only for TV and fools like me to watch...."
B006W59XOQ Well I'm almost embarrassed to say how much I've enjoyed Dance Moms. Some think it's like approving of child abuse, but my take is each of these kids have at least one loving parent (no matter how misguided), they seem to love Abby (maybe a little less asthe show goes on) and want to be there. Meanwhile, for some reason I love all the emotional back and forth. I love the Moms (not equally - Christi and Holly are my favorites). I'll have to contemplate why I enjoy it so much."
B006W59XOQ The fun continues in season two.This show is a guilty pleasure.  This reality television show chronicles the competition dancers at Abby Lee Dance Studion in Pittsburgh along with their stage, uh I mean dance moms.  The dancers are genuinely talented, but the behavior of the studio owner/teacher, Abby, and the dance moms is increasingly more outrageous.  Their behaivor may be wild, but it sure is fun to watch!"
B006W59XOQ I hate drama in my life.... But I LOVE the drama in at a far! Haha.... I DVR ALL DANCE MOM'S."
B006W59XOQ It kills me how parents act when they'er kids do something. they need to sit down and shut up. they pay her to teach them to dance then they complain about her teaching them"
B006W59XOQ I am obsessed with Dance Moms much to my chagrin.  Each episode leaves me conflicted about whether I dislike the moms or Abby more while loving the kids.  Sometimes I understand Abby's frustrations and then pride and then I understand the moms frustrations about the forced competitions between the kids.  I cheer and rage then cheer again.  As I have said I am obsessed with this show.  Cant wait to see how growth changes things."
B006W59XOQ And I started watching it myself, I found it to be a little too dramatic, but watchable. The show is okay!"
B006W59XOQ If you like season one of dance moms, this season starts up with a bang and raises the silly caddyness to a whole new level. It is really quite fantastic-shameless reality at its best. If you do not like reality tv, definitely skip it. If you love reality tv but it right now!!!"
B006W59XOQ I don't know why I keep watching.  From Abby's cruelty to the mom's fighting, I wonder how these talented girls will turn out in adulthood.  I don't recommend watching with children in the room at all.  Children need to always be affirmed and not have a critical spirit washed over them constantly.  Yes, there is a time for critism that helps, but constant negetive critism is justs harmful to ones spirit.  Why these mother's constantly put their children in this environment is a strange puzzle to me."
B006W59XOQ These moms are crazy.  If their kid gets a solo they complain the choreography is bad.  If they don't then Abby is evilThe way Christy attracts the other moms especially the new ones is so seventh grade.O"
B006W59XOQ The show features training and performances of pre-teen dancers, but is mostly about the bloated egos of the dance moms and dance instructor, Abbey Lee.  One would have to search far and wide to find a more quarrelsome coven of harridans.  The kids are talented young (5-14 years) aspiring chorines who are amazingly calm amidst the chaotic sniping of their mothers.  There don't seem to be any men around to serve as male role models.  Someone call Child Services!"
B006W59XOQ Love this show... The girls are so amazing to watch in competition.. The moms are a hoot...Abby seems a little harsh and seems to show favoritism but it is her show..."
B006W59XOQ The show keeps my interest.  The infighting is bothersome but watching the children dance is worth it.  I was sort of embarrassed to be watching it with all the language and fighting.  Even those I thought had a bit of class began to join in the frey.  I just keep watching though."
B006W59XOQ I sat down to watch this out of a mix of boredom and curiosity one day.  I was hooked after the first episode.  I even got my boyfriend watching it.  The girls in the show are amazing dancers, and their mothers are just something special.  I would recommend it because it's not what you'd expect.  Give it a try!"
B006W59XOQ my daughter loves this show she watches every time she can get on the tv, she love watching all the dances the girls do and seeing what new costume they will be wearing.  doesn't care for all the bickering and yelling between the moms and abbey though"
B006W59XOQ Shows the dedicated work of a dancing studio's group of young girls who also must endure the immature antics of their own parents and coach. The challenge to dance competitively Is hard enough, but listening to the constantly vocal squabbles going on every day between the 'adults' makes the whole show a combination of beautiful artistry and soap opera clashes. If you can put up with the zany adults' behavior, you will love watching the girls' performances!"
B006W59XOQ THE DANCERS REALLY HAVE ALOT OF TALENT AND THE MOTHERS DO NOT REALIZE THAT ABBY YELLING AT THEIR CHILDREN IS NO DIFFERENT THAN IF THEY WERE IN ANOTHER SPORT. ABBY DOES NOT SWEAR AND CUZ AT THE KIDS OR YELL AT THEM WHEN THEY ARE PREFORMING WHICH IS WHAT OTHER COACHES DO IN OTHER SPORTS. IT IS NOT ABBYS JOB TO KEEP THE MOTHERS HAPPY, AND THE CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN TO SPEAK UP TO ABBY, THAT EARNS HER RESPECT, SHE IS A SMART SAVVY WOMAN AND CAN HELP  THEM ALL TRY AND REACH FOR THEIR DREAMS IF THEY WOULD JUST BELIEVE IN ABBY.HAVE ALREADY WATCHED SEASON 3 ALOT OF MOM DRAMA, LOOKING FORWARD TO ABBY'S DECISION FOR SEASON 4 STARTING NEW YEARS DAY 2014"
B006W59XOQ Yes, I like trash TV... These moms are drama filled. Not sure I'd ever let my child have contact with Abbie Lee Miller, but it's entertaining."
B006W59XOQ I've already written my review of season 3 which is still showing on Lifetime.  I've now seen this season twice and I don't know what to say that I haven't already written in the previous review.  Miss Abby Lee Miller is quite a character.  As I mentioned in the previous review, I had a band teacher in high school much like her.  She's honest to a fault for sure but there's one thing I totally disagree with her about and that's what she says to her students about their mothers.  For God's sake, Abby!  How would you have felt if your teacher had run down your mother (even if she acted foolish) every single day?  You'd have felt terrible; yet these children love you and want to be taught by you even if your mouth runs ahead of your brain.  I have no heroes with the moms - Kelly, please stop whining about your children being on the bottom of the pyramid.  Let's face it - if they worked as hard as Maddie, then maybe they'd have her position.  Christi - you're funny as he** but OMG you come off so jealous of Maddie, it's ridiculous.  Melissa - quit trying to please everyone you're with.  The moms aren't right near as often as they'd like to think so if you want your daughter to be a better dancer, then follow your own heart.  Your daughter's so dedicated that it won't take much from you to get ahead on the 'mom' pyramid.  Holly (or rather Dr Holly) - you are almost over educated.  Some of the stuff that comes out of your mouth makes me laugh because you say them so seriously.  Jill - well, is the grass greener at different studios??  And most of all, ladies, if Abby pisses you off this much and you feel so strongly that your children are mistreated by her, then why are you there?  I certainly don't want to come off as Leslie but it is what it is.  Okay now that I've talked to the characters, I'll tell you why I love the show - watching the interactions of the moms/Abby/girls.  And of course there's Cathy.  There's nothing I can say about that lady (that's putting it nicely).  If you love dance, you'll love watching the girls dance - it's amazing and heart lifting.  But Christi, as much as you'd like to believe it, the show (probably unfortunately) is not about the girls completely - maybe half of it is but it's called Dance Moms for a reason."
B006WC63X8 I started watching this series, so I had to finish the season.  The show has been cancelled now.  Probably because it was a little farfetched."
B006WC63X8 Always an entertaining show. A combination of Perry Mason, Hill Street Blues, the Godfather and CSI as the McDeere's try to stay alive between the competing forces of the Mob, corrupt law enforcement bureaucrats and the Russian Mafia. A good show!"
B006WC63X8 I watched this first season a year after it ended, and I'm sorry there wasn't more. I liked the original movie, but I have to admit I liked this TV series a little better. Perhaps it was Josh Lucas in the role of Mitch McDeere--he did a great job. The stories are engaging, and despite some of the far-fetched behavior, it's great entertainment. I would liked to have seen it continue, especially since they didn't have a chance to close out the story-lines completely. Good pace to each episode, a nice cast, and a terrific lead actor."
B006WC63X8 I loved this show! My wife and I were extremely disappointed when it got cancelled. If I had the money I would pay to bring it back!"
B006WC63X8 I thought me, my mom and step father would like this show so I set it to record on our FIOS.  It started out good.  I was interested in what was going on.  Then something happened.  With every episode it got wortse and worse.  Let me tell you why.  First, every episode, a lawyer, his wife, lawyers brother and brothers girlfriend escape military trained killers.  EVERY time.  At first I thought, they couldn't kill the people because they would get arrested.  Everyone would blame them.  But then I realized something.  No body execpt for about 5 people know what is gong on.  It's not like thousands of people know who is after them.  They could go on the street, shoot them in the head and run.  No one would ever know who did it.  Another thing that bothered me was when the lawyers wife would go talk to his clients about their case.  Would never happen.  Something else that annoyed me was a few episodes ago.  They had the man behind the stuff, the judge saw things that showed he did it, then she said she couldn't use it in cort because the lawyer acted as law.  Freaking crazy right?  Then the last episode, the way it ended made everything pointless.  It is as if they just said \"ok were done with this\" and ended it.  What a complete waste of time.  It's not even worth watching the first episode.Oh, another thing, an episode comes on, builds up, up, up goes on commercial, comes back on and starts building up to something new.  It is crazy.  They need to build up the story through the episode and stick with one thing.  They never solve anthing.  It's like you put a bunch of problems in a jar, stick your hand in and pull one out and that is whats next."
B006WC63X8 NBC was banking that there was an audience clamoring to catch up with the characters from the wildly popular John Grisham novel and Tom Cruise movie \"The Firm.\"  Just one hitch, the movie came out 12 years ago.  And while glitzy, polished, and fun, it is hardly a genre classic that feels particular relevant today.  TV audiences did not flock to the 2012 \"The Firm\" and so the show was shuffled around as it burnt out its run during the summer season.  To truly embrace the series, it helps to have a strong memory and a working knowledge of the material from a dozen years ago.  This picks up roughly ten years after the conclusion of that story.  The show has the good fortune to have cast Josh Lucas (my choice for one of our more underrated actors) in the Mitch McDeere role with the always appealing Molly Parker as his wife Abby.  The couple has struggled after bringing down the mob-fronted law firm of the original, and the show begins with them stepping away from Federal Witness Protection to try for a more normal life. But these expectations are thwarted as past enemies have not forgotten the pair and new intrigue is just around the bend.Combining elements of mystery with courtroom drama with adventure, \"The Firm\" is certainly a well made show.  At 22 episodes, though, it faces the unenviable task of filling up too many hours and so its plotting becomes wildly uneven.  As a more concise mini-series, the show would have benefited greatly by focusing its story to the strongest elements possible.  And it might have made a terrifically entertaining short series.  As is though, it can be convoluted and meandering.  Just when the episodes reach a peek, the story will veer off on a less successful tangent.  All in all, \"The Firm\" is well constructed and well cast.  I just don't know that it is as compelling as it might have been.  It's easy enough to watch and to like, it just doesn't seem quite as fresh as some of the edgier fare (with similar themes) that can now be found all over cable networks.The 22 episodes from the series (it will not be coming back) are spread over 6 discs for this DVD release.Bonus features include:Sneak Peek featurette: Origins of The Firm by John Grisham\"Josh Lucas is Mitch McDeere\" featureCast and Crew InterviewsBehind the Scenes FootageMy favorite aspect of this iteration of \"The Firm\" is its cast.  Lucas and Parker are quite solid.  But Juliette Lewis continues to be a scene stealer in every project that she's in.  It's also good to see Callum Keith Rennie and Tricia Helfer in the same show as a mini \"Battlestar Gallactica\" reunion.  If you saw the show and loved it, this is an easy choice for you.  Even though I liked it, however, it is not a DVD that I think I would rewatch. So it's hard to make an outright recommendation.  Check it out if you like the cast, it would just be easier to endorse had the show been shorter and more concise.  About 3 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the cast.  KGHarris, 10/12."
B006WC63X8 Excellent acting and storyline !!! Wish it would have been renewed. I loved this T.V. show. It kept me on edge."
B006WC63X8 I found this series to be well written, keeps your interest and each episode leaves you wanting more. Definitely worth the time and money."
B006WC63X8 I was very impressed with the Firm as a TV series. It moved along, had great action and a wonderfulstory. I only hope NBC or another network, picks it up again for a second season. It would be a shameif the series ended for good. I loved it!!"
B006WC63X8 Great series.  Too bad the series had no second season.  What has happened to the supporting cast?  Does Josh Lucas ever shave?"
B006X41N2Q Pretty amazing what they can do on this show.  It's always an education to see how many steps it takes to the end product. Rick, Ron, Tyler and Bretley make it entertaining enough and our family usually learns something about the past and how things were done.  Good tv for the whole fam."
B006X41N2Q This is my favorite show on TV these days, along with Pawn Stars and American Pickers.  Glad to finally have more episodes on the way.  I think it's a good price for the amount of content too."
B006X41N2Q I'm sorta glad they turned the focus of the show more on the people , however being a picker, I really miss some of the details of the restorations too.Overall its a good show about a great family and how they work together, whats not to like about that ?Trust me family is all ya got any way !!!"
B006X41N2Q It is great to see a small business turn trash into treasure. It makes me want to go out and fix something!"
B006X41N2Q Rick can do no wrong, it seems.  The new place looks great and I'm glad to see his son taking on more responsibility.  Kowboy is always funny. I love watching a few episodes before bed."
B006X41N2Q As a fan of history and pop culture, it's always fun to see things that are old become new again.  I especially love when the projects cross over with the guys from Pawn Stars and American Pickers, all great shows!"
B006X41N2Q Great show.  I really enjoy seeing Rick and the crew refurbish the odd items that come their way.  They really do a nice job."
B006X41N2Q As a family of antique dealers, I love this program.  It not only shows some great old things ( and a good variety of them too), but you get a smattering of history as well.  Lots of fun with just enough banter to break it up and enough interesting types of restorations to keep you coming back for more.  Thanks for a &#34;reality show&#34; that isn't drivel."
B006X41N2Q I think this program is entertaining, thats what TV is supposed to do. Rick seems like a nice Guy who has a lot of talent."
B006X41N2Q I love to watch them restore old items. If you like history and working with your hands this is the show to watch. I just hope it doesn't turn into drama surrounding the owner and his employees just leave it about the restorations."
B006X41N2Q My Husband & I enjoy Restoration/Pickers & of course, Pawn Stars! The only complaint I have is: A&E/History does not include ALL the episodes. As with Pawn. Have'nt opened Pickers yet so I can't comment . We want the Pick Pawn/Polish Crossovers as well as the Future Sturgis Crossovers. Wrote to the Stations. Have'nt received any answers, but I digress: Rick Dale & his crazy crew are magicians who can take a piece of junk & turn it into a piece of art.It's incredible how the Team works together even though they act like they don't get along. We  really wish whomever put these together would get their ACT together & contain EVERY show IN ORDER."
B006X41N2Q We really enjoy this show and wish there were more of them on Prime..  Moves fasts and brings back memories of when people were true craftsmen."
B006X41N2Q Always dig their work. A very interesting way to learn the history of machines & society's urge to preserve it."
B006X41N2Q This show used to be everything one could hope for in Reality TV.  The characters were real, the setting was real, the &#34;action&#34; showed real process.Sadly, with this season, the producers rolled out a new over-wrought title block and a new production outline that has substituted fakey acting and dialog for the old idea of showing the process of &#34;Restoration&#34; at which they used to be so good.Now the show has devolved to be just another gabfest, and largely a waste of time.Its just sad."
B006X41N2Q This show is a good window into our society decades ago.  It's not only fascinating to see objects from our past come back to life, but it's very interesting to learn what their original purpose was."
B006X41N2Q Thes guys do fabulous work, on old and nearly scrap pieces, to like new.Almost as good as new, depending on what the customer wants or would like it yo be.Sadly, you see little of the actual restoration, and more of the interaction with the gang or crew.However it is fun to watch, and that is why we watch these characters."
B006X41N2Q Rick and crew do amazing work resoring items of the past .I work in the trades and i really appriciate the craftsmanship envolved in these restorations"
B006X41N2Q Some of the best shows from the restoration program.  Its fun to see items folks have kept for years that need a bit of a touch up or a large make over.  Seeing the beginning and the ending product to me is facanating.  Great for you to see history and what can be done when worked by a master."
B006X41N2Q It is so fun to watch the items in their completion.  I am constantly amazed though at the amount of money people will spend to get something restored.  Wow!"
B006X41N2Q my husband and i really enjoy how this show has progressed and is really a great history show on items."
B006X41N2Q THE BEST!!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!WHEN I HAD CABLE I USED TO GET THIS SERIES....WHEN IT WAS OFFERED BY AMAZON PRIME I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO SEE IT AGAIN!!!!THE BEST IS THERE IS NO COMMERCALS!!!!!"
B006X41N2Q Rick always seems to try to make exactly as they were originally.  Good work ethic.  I would encourage baby boomers to see what can be accomplished with forgotten items in attics and sheds."
B006X41N2Q I never had watched this show but checked it out on my Kindle.  Pretty neat how these real craftsman restore vintage items and make a good living out of pleasing both the customer and themselves with how their restorations come out."
B006X41N2Q This show is great fun.  You get to see historical and unusual and antique objects restored.  Season 2 spends a bit too much time on the cast dynamics.  I wish they'd spend more showing how the actual restorations are done, which is what got us watching Season 1.  In any event, it's one of our go-to shows because it's always satisfying."
B006X41N2Q This man could make a rotten turd look like a million bucks. I'd work with him just to learn some of his tricks."
B006X6JHH2 If you're a fan you need know no more. It was perfect. \"Laugh out loud\" funny. I want to write more but it would spoil the fun for those who have yet to see this episode.It's a treasure."
B006X6JHH2 The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Anyone who has ever enjoyed the exploits of Patsy and Edina will surely be happy to know that the pair are still thriving!  Twenty years after the 1992 debut of \"Absolutely Fabulous,\" Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley return to their iconic roles for these three short form specials.  And it's a reunion well worth taking.  Boozy, bawdy, and wildly inappropriate--I think that it's fair to say that the gal pals still exist in a universe of their own devising.  That's good news for the viewers, but not always a pleasure for the others in their midst.  In addition to Lumley and Saunders, many of your favorite original characters also return (in some form or another) and you just might be surprised to learn what they've been up to!The three specials are Identity, Job and Olympics.Identity:  Kicking things off, this special has to reintroduce the cast in a rapid and effective manner and it succeeds tremendously.  Saffron (Edina's usually sensible daughter) returns home after a long absence and welcomes another unexpected guest in the process. Not to ruin the surprise, but it's not quite the homecoming you would anticipate.  Saffron's visitor has past ties to Patsy and, in a word, the situation is complicated.  To extricate herself from this difficulty, Patsy must face her biggest demons--her age and her vanity.  And Saunders, as usual, is terrific!Job:  A hilarious spoof on celebrity, hype, and public relations, Edina decides to represent and promote French Film star Jeanne Durand in a one night only can't-miss concert performance.  Needless to say, things do not go smoothly!  Lindsay Duncan is spot-on as the aging star, but the hero of this piece is a familiar and welcome face.  Bubble (the wondrous and hysterical Jane Horrocks) plays a big part in keeping this sinking ship afloat.  Some great physical comedy is utilized in the resolution as they ladies attempt to pull off a great con.Olympics:  What better way to honor \"Absolutely Fabulous\" than to have the ladies skewer the 2012 Olympics!  With madness overrunning the city, only Edina could be completely oblivious to the event.  When hearing, however, that one of her idols is close at hand--she hatches another harebrained plot that involves plenty of Olympic intrigue.  Silly and over-the-top, this caper is a great capper with plenty of slapstick and surprises.  Seeing Lumley and Saunders struggle through the difficulties in this episode, it's like bringing back two champions committed to absolute lunacy.Are these three specials the best that \"Absolutely Fabulous\" have to offer?  Maybe not, but they are inspired madness.  I'm just happy to catch up with old friends (even ones with as much baggage as these two).  It's also great to visit with Mother (June Whitfield), Saffron (Julia Sawalha), and Bubble (the previously mentioned Horrocks).  A lot of fun and a definite must-own to complete your collection (oh no, does this mean another Complete AbFab DVD collection is around the corner)?  KGHarris, 7/12."
B006X6JHH2 It is worth watching over and over. It makes you laugh out loud and sometimes feel sorry for some of the people in the show... I loved it a lot!"
B006X6JHH2 These latest shows are some of the best yet.  It really seems that Edina has &#34;softened&#34; up to Saffy and Patsy is definitely starting to show her age in more ways than one!"
B006X6JHH2 My fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has already done a fine job on detailing the basics of this grouping of three very funny \"specials\" which reunited the \"girls\" of AbFab (and other characters from the BBC show, so I won't take your time to repeat that info. But I hope I can add a few extra pieces of info.In answer to the question raised by another reviewer (Caroline Bender), the three episodes do not run 90 minutes. They run \"90 Minutes APPROX.). Each episode is about 28 minutes long. Generally the US versions of BBC Home Video releases are the UK versions - with some \"language\" that was cut for BBC America cable airings. I can't be for sure , but I'm guessing these are the same episodes aired in the UK.There are TWO DVD extras, not previously mentioned: Both have to do with Edina and Patsy appearing on a BBC benefit called \"Sports Relief\". First we get the portion of the SR show (about seven minutes) and then the \"Behind The Scenes at Sports Relief\" where the cast comments on things like Jennifer Saunders (who plays Edina and writes the scripts for AbFab) constantly changing thee script to keep it funny. This \"Behind the Scenes\" extra runs about 17 minutes.I have to admit I've only seen a few of the AbFab shows, but found these funny. I'm sure they will more than satisfy AbFab fans.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B006X6JHH2 something happened circa 09/11/01. This show kinda soured. I used to think this show was hilarious. And since 9/11 the episodes were bad. Not even funny. It was kinda nostalgic to see this in 2012, which is why I give it 3 stars  when it should have gotten 2. And for that I think it is worth seeing by anyone who used to enjoy them. But the story was not really funny and they are all just old. Even Bubbles looks like an old woman trying to play a young woman--clownish or even a parody of her character. Kinda sad I think. But the grandmother looks well and her age. She doesn't seem to age much I don't think. Anyway how many story lines can they make about drugs? I never thought that was funny in this show or any movie for that matter. I guess there are people who do . . . from the laughter I hear sometimes in the movie theatre.  But because they obviously are limited at this point in what they can come up with they just made this entire episode about drugs. It kinda in a strange way reminds me of Lucille Ball and I Love Lucy. She should have just stopped after I Love Lucy. Instead she continued in an awful way with The Lucy Show doing the same tired old skits in a new show. Some were literally the same plot in a new dressing. She just ruined the image. When you have a good thing know when to stop."
B006Y5AV68 They don't over-complicate recipes - in fact, the opposite - they find the best way to make dishes.  The easiest, best-tasting, easy-to-follow."
B006Y5AV68 I love cooking shows, partly because I love to cook but also because I find them very soothing. &#34;America's Test Kitchen&#34; does a lot in half an hour, so it is incredibly informative, but I do miss the more relaxed pace of something like &#34;Made in Spain&#34; or &#34;Molto Mario&#34;. Still, this show is very educational and very well done, it's a half hour well spent!"
B006Y5AV68 While it isn't my favorite season, I'm still happy to have it on Amazon.  I'm looking forward to next season though!  I think my favorite episode was where they talked about how to cook eggs.  I have found that this method is superior to the dried out eggs I have cooked in the past.  I suppose you don't know what you don't know."
B006Y5AV68 The show shows how to make food dishes, why it works, ideas for doing things differently than normal, and product information. Very informative."
B006Y5AV68 I LOVE this show!  I've tried some of the recipes and they came out very nice!  My hubby and kids also love to watch this show.  I love how informative and educational it can be."
B006Y5AV68 I'm a bit worried about writing a review for this.  The past few cooking shows that I reviewed were pulled off of Amazon Prime right after I wrote a good review for them.  Good Eats and Man Vs Food (to name a couple of the shows that I reviewed and have now been pulled).  But I digress.  This is a GREAT SHOW!  I love it!  it's very educational, they have some science worked in to the show, along with reviews of kitchen utensils and food.  My whole family loves to watch it.  I've even gone so far as to buy their cookbook!  It's packed with tons of recipes and I'm excited to try out the home made pizza recipe along with the breakfast cranberry muffins!"
B006Y5AV68 Ewwww, the scrambled eggs were \"wet\" and slimy looking....made me want to gag. I'm sorry, but I prefer mine cooked all the way, which I guess equals over-cooked, but I can't stand them runny or shiny in any way. If I were making them, I would have let them cook for at least another minute or until they were not longer \"wet\". I also wanted to say, that apparently this is NOT the way to cook scrambled eggs if you want them to be really awesome. I've read that you're supposed to cook them over a really low heat for a looonnngggg time, over half an hour! And that cooking them like that makes them taste incredible. But, who wants to take that much time to cook scrambled eggs?!And, HELLO! They're basically promoting using peanut butter with the dreaded hydrogenated oil in it! No mention of the ingredients (I noticed the Jiff said \"peanut butter spread\" and \"90% peanuts\" on the label, which makes me wonder what the other 10% is...) or the fact that hydrogenated oil contains TRANS FATS which I thought were supposed to be extremely detrimental to your health. And in case you didn't know, manufacturers remove the peanut oil and replace it with a cheaper oil like soy or canola oil. I mean, who wants all that nasty peanut oil in their peanut butter anyway...? They can make more money selling the peanut oil by itself!Well, I understand it's not a show about health food, but then they showed how to make a nice, and really healthy sounding, cranberry nut muffin. Yeah, I know what you're thinking...it had all those pecans in it, but nuts are good for you, and it's not like you're going to eat ALL the muffins yourself...right?So, minus 2 stars for the slimy eggs and bad peanut butter choices. I still like the show, but just wanted to comment on this episode.Thanks!"
B006Y5AV68 This is a good cooking show, it provides good explanation on how the recipes works. I think this is the best way to learn cooking. I hope Amazon puts more season for their Prime accounts."
B006Y5AV68 This is my all time favorite cooking show. I have made several of these recipes after watching the videos and hopping in the car to get all the ingrdients at the grocery, and each one came out exactly as it should have. My fave is the episode with the french apple cake. I cant remember which season that is but the cake is amazing and very true to the flatter, sweet cake the french make with lots of apples. These recipes are manageable for your average hobbiest/cook in your own home's kitchen. The only recipe i will decline to make is croissants... that one is just took much trouble. Rather the bakery handle that one! If youclike to cook ajx want a variety of interesting, doable and true to promised good taste, watch all these episodes and seasons."
B006Y5AV68 We love to learn the science behind cooking and all of the recipes are delicious. If you love to cook, check this show out!"
B006Y5AV68 My husband and I really enjoy this show. The team is so professional and they have great rapport with each other. We would really like to see more seasons from time to time available with our Prime membership. This is just a tease"
B006Y5AV68 Easy to follow recipes. I like how they modernize the classics. I'm even venturing into the world of baking since I've been watching America's Test Kitchen. I'm glad I don't have to wait a week between episodes anymore."
B006Y5AV68 loved all the episodes and even cooked some of the recipes shown on the videos.  Will cook Turkey and dressing this Holiday season"
B006Y5AV68 Love this show. They will test a recipe until it is perfect. Then they explain WHY it is prepared a certain way. Their product tests and taste-testing are also helpful."
B006Y5B2XE I did not like this series quite as much as Doc Martin, but it will give a laugh or two."
B006Y5B2XE entertaining and surprising twist of actual humanity. I would like to see more seasons of this and see how things go on in the relationship."
B006Y5B2XE I was eager to see Martin Clunes in something else.  His looks and demeanor seemed singular.  One of the things I liked best about Doc Martin was the village and villagers in contemporary England...a kind of Northern Exposure of the UK experience.In Reggie Perrin, the writing is whip smart, not to mention Clunes delivers his asides and torments in excellent comic style.  Very enjoyable exploration of yet another wacky Office/Company/Ship of Fools."
B006Y5B2XE I loved the original series, which I saw many years ago in the UK.  I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy this remake because the original series was so good, but I enjoyed it very much.  It brought the original series up to date in a contemporary situation and had me laughing out loud from time to time.  Strongly recommend this to all who enjoy the British somewhat sarcastic sense of humor."
B006Y5B2XE Seeing Reggie come alive in Clunes has been a true pleasure to watch! The cast is extremely well suited to compliment him in every way."
B006Y5B2XE My husband and I both love Martin Clunes in Doc Martin and in the documentary he did on dogs.  We were very disappointed in Regiie Perrin.  Canned laughter and certainly not a very challenging role for him to play.  Just not the same caliber as Doc Martin. If you have nothing to compare it to Reggie might be quite entertaining."
B006Y5B2XE Remember Reggie Perrin? Don't be confused this is not the wonderful original but a poor and very unconvincing remake. Its terrible."
B006Y5B2XE This reminds me of a typical sitcom with people that would be fired by the end of their first day of work because of incompetence. Reggie isn't intellectually stimulated by his position in the grooming industry even though he is good at it. He frequently has Walter Middy type daydreams in his workplace and at home which are so funny. Both his dialogue and delivery are what make this a funny show. If you like British humor, you will enjoy this TV show &#34;on this side of the pond&#34;."
B006Y5B2XE lot of cook book / software generated screen play writing.  Cliches abound,like to see the mean side of Mr Perrin."
B006Y5B2XE This show would kill if it didn't have a laugh track. If it were made today it probably would not have it. British humor rocks."
B006Y5B2XE If you liked Doc Martin you will probably like this thought the characters are not so numerous or so quirky endearing. It is a robust commentary on life in the corporate world (at least somewhere). The quick asides are marvelous as are the fantasy quick episodes. The episodes get better as you go on."
B006Y5BWQG I usually do not like &#34;musicals&#34;, but when I saw Smash was available on prime-I figured why not.The story line got me in the first episode, 2 aspiring actors/singers vying for the same role. one looking for her first big break and the other was a Midwestern town wanting to get her foot in the door.Enough said, good story line, interesting characters and yes...good music"
B006Y5BWQG It was a long wait to get SMASH on dvd but here it is and the wait was well worth it.  I fell in love with this show from the first second of the first episode with Katharine McPhee singing the intro to SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  I love the theater and was so excited that a tv show was actually going to honestly display what went into the production and making of a musical.  This show is different than any other on tv.  The cast is amazing.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston and Jack Davenport are stars known for other tv roles and these roles are like nothing they have ever done.  And we get Megan Hilty and Christian Borle direct from the Broadway and theater world.  All shine.  Borle and Messing in particular have a great chemistry.The plot takes many twists and turns and will keep you totally enthralled.  What holds it all together like glue are the amazing musical numbers.  There are some current songs performed but the best are the songs written for the musical MARILYN that the show is about putting together.  And for me the true star here is Katharine McPhee.  I have always been a fan but the dimensions of her musical talent are astounding.  Her voice is strong, beautiful, powerful and emotive.  When she sings BEAUTIFUL tears will come to your eyes.  But what is most exciting is how well she meets all the demands of music within a Broadway show.  Her singing of the show tunes in combination with her superb dancing is the highlight here for me.  She's definitely got the IT factor.  Each episode has shining moments and the whole cast is exceptional but for me the whole season builds to the superb final episode and in particular the closing song.  What a high note to end the season on.  There are only 15 episodes here but they perfectly build a story of relationships, drama, dreams, fears, trials and tribulations while showing all the steps in the making of a musical.My only disappointment is that the show was only released on dvd.  I was waiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.  The show with all its glitz and glam and superb musical numbers definitely merited it and I also think all true die hard fans would have gone with the blu ray.  But I will settle for the dvd.  I've already rewatched the entire 15 episodes twice and I highly recommend getting this show on dvd.  And don't think you have to love the theater to like this show.  As stated the acting is superb, and the music will pull you in.  The rivalry between Hilty and McPhee is a fun factor in the season but just a glimpse into the whole story line there is.  I can't wait for season 2 in February!  Ane more McPhee!"
B006Y5BWQG First of all, if you are a rather conservative person and/or can't stand to see two men kissing each other (A LOT), then you will want to avoid this show. I'm straight, but I'm fairly liberal, and lived most of my life in California, not all that far from San Francisco. I've had many gay, lesbian, and bisexual friends and co-workers, so I'm somewhat used to this.Why so many gay characters in one show? Simple - it's about Broadway. It's about musical theater, which involves a lot of dancing. It's common knowledge that lots of men involved in Broadway and professional dance are gay. This show strives to be honest and realistic, as far as I can tell, and having lots of gay men in the show is realistic.Ok.. moving on.So, why did I, a straight dude who isn't overly fond of Broadway musicals, watch this show?I needed some variety. My favorite shows are \"Community,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Person of Interest,\" and \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"  Three of those four shows have at least some violence in them, and some suspense as well. Also, I've watched all the episodes of \"Community\" over and over again MANY times. I needed something different from what I've been watching. \"Smash\" is certainly different.Another reason I watched both seasons of this program is that I am very much interested in the creative process, and creative people. I like shows, movies, and documentaries about creative people, such as writers, actors, filmmakers, musicians..And lastly, I wondered how a Broadway show would start out, how it got put together, how a musical went from script and score to the stage, what it would be like to be a writer, director, producer, actor, etc. This show presents all those things, which I think is really great. The behind the scenes people get as much screen time as those who take the stage night after night.The show starts out with a man and woman who are creative partners. The man writes the music and the woman writes the script/story. They are sitting around trying to come up with a new musical. They've been working together for ten years, and have already had several hits. They want to continue their winning streak. An idea for a musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe comes from an unlikely source, and they go with that idea.The two then team up with a producer and a director, and put a cast together. Surprisingly, very few auditions are shown, which I found slightly disappointing at first, but then thought that hey.. we get loads of auditions in shows like \"American Idol,\" so we don't need all that here on \"Smash.\"There are two women who are competing for the role of Marilyn, and seem equally great to the various people in charge of making decisions for the musical. Some of the show is about the rivalry between these two women. Both actresses have their supporters and detractors.I'd say half the show is dedicated to getting the musical up and running, and the rest is about the personal lives of the various characters. Show business of any kind can wreak havoc on relationships. Also, creative people often tend to be neurotic. None of the personal lives of any of the characters goes really smooth.The cast and the acting..Megan Hilty plays Ivy Lynn, one of the two actresses vying to play Monroe. Ivy has been in the business for many years, but keeps getting stuck in the chorus (also called the ensemble, as far as I can tell). She's never had a big break. Ivy is a VERY sexy, devious and ambitious blonde. Hilty plays this character perfectly, and has a fantastic voice and stage presence.Kathrine McPhee plays Karen Cartwright. Karen is a sweet, too-skinny brunette who is practically a saint. She's too nice to be all that interesting. She's my least favorite character on the show. Also, McPhee, unlike Hilty, does not have a Broadway background. McPhee has a much more pop-sounding voice. She was an American Idol contender some years ago. She got to second place, if I remember correctly.I know McPhee can play a sexy and sneaky character. She played just such a character in an episode of \"Community,\" and was very good. It's not her fault her character is too nice.Debra Messing plays Julia, the \"book\" writer.. who writes the story and script for the musical. Julia is straight, but not exactly cut out for monogamy. She is confident at times, but at other times, practically falling apart. Messing plays this character well, and is rather attractive. I think she is great in this role. I've never watched an episode of \"Will & Grace,\" so this is the first show in which I've seen Messing.Julia's creative partner, Tom, played by Christian Borle, is gay, a little more psychologically stable than Julia, and funny. He writes the music. Tom gets some of the best lines in the show. He is very good friends with Ivy. Factions eventually develop.. some people are in favor of Ivy getting the lead role, some want Karen to get it, others are on the fence for most of the show.Derek, the director, is played by British actor Jack Davenport. He's a tyrannical, womanizing guy who just has to try and bed any woman who has the potential to be a lead actress, and some women who are not. He occasionally has moments of kindness, and is witty. He's got that great, dry British style of humor. He doesn't much like working with gay men, and this creates both tension and amusement. Derek and Tom, for example, really don't like each other, and both are good with creative insults.The last person in the cast I shall mention is Eileen. She is the producer of the musical, and is played by Anjelica Huston. You probably have already seen Huston in one or more films, and know she's a talented actress. I'm a fan of Huston because she's been in several Wes Anderson movies, and I tend to love Wes Anderson movies (though not all of them).Huston's character, Eileen, is a very tough, driven, but not mean woman. Eileen is a very likeable character. She is going through a divorce with her philandering husband. She and her husband had always worked together as a team. The Monroe musical is the first one Eileen is attempting to produce without her husband.Overall, the acting, by practically everyone, is, as the British say, spot on.So.. why 4 stars instead of 5?Two reasons. The first reason is, in neither in the first, nor the second season, do we get to see the whole musical. I think there should have been one episode entirely dedicated to just showing the musical. We see tons of work put into it, and we do get to see some numbers, but we never get to see the finished product. I found this to be very frustrating.Another thing I didn't like.. some of the songs just aren't good. There are not only Broadway-style songs in the show, but pop songs as well. Some of the pop songs are covers, and some are originals, I'm guessing. I actually liked most of the songs for the musical though.The last reason I am deducting one star is that I just can't see Karen as being strong competition for Ivy. Ivy looks quite a bit like Monroe, regardless of what she is wearing. Also, Ivy has the Broadway voice. Karen, when dressed as Marilyn, looks freakish to me. And, Karen has a pop-singer voice. To me, the blatantly obvious choice for Marilyn is Ivy. I will not tell you who ends up with the lead role.Although this show is not perfect, it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, in my opinion the second season is not as good. Still worth watching, but definitely not as good as the first season. I won't get into the reasons why in this review.Thanks for reading."
B006Y5BWQG Katharine McPhee could've won American Idol but she was destined to do something else in life.  She is an actress with a golden voice.  This talent opens opportunities that not everyone can handle.  A show like smash was definitely written around her and she deserves it.I can't wait for season two.  There is enough drama in the last season that kept me watching.  My family loves it and I surely enjoy watching the show."
B006Y5BWQG for the first time on this show i found myself rewinding a number again and again to rewatch.  it was that good.  it was not sung by either marilyn.  this was joe dimaggio's song about the end of his marriage.  it was a real show stopper. this should be happening more often than it is.  for all the technical greatness the two marilyns have, i have yet to desire an album by either of them.coming in as a close second was bernadette peters reprising ethel merman's performance of ROSES in GYPSY.that neither marilyn is knocking me out with star charisma fits in with the storyline as the people in charge hear from investors that they want someone else in the role, preferably a well known actress like scarlett johanssen.this show is still finding its footing but it is very promising.  angelica huston remains my favorite character."
B006Y5BWQG This is a wonderful show about the ins and outs of on stage productions. The cast of actors is unparalled"
B006Y5BWQG So many singers and dancers who are SO talented and believable in their acting/dancing skills. I do not like all the sex that you threw in, especially homosexual partners kissing. Did not like that at all but I endured the not so normal kissing scenes because the rest of show was great.  It is difficult for us &#34;normal&#34; people to see scenes like that."
B006Y5BWQG This is a great series. Especially anyone interested in dancing, writing, directing, the theater.  I could go on and on but suggest u see for yourself. You won't be disappointed"
B006Y5BWQG I marathoned episodes every night for four days staying up to two in the morning and being exhausted the next day at work because I had to see it. And bought the second season immediately aftet! The music performances were so good. I really enjoyed the actors. So sad to hear it might be canceled."
B006Y5BWQG I really couldn't decide between four or five stars because there are a few amazingly talented people on this show. Sure, the acting is iffy. I can't say anything about the believability since I don't know anything about show business, but it doesn't seem too far-fetched. I don't keep watching this for the acting or the plot. I keep watching because Katharine McPhee (Karen) and Will Chase (Michael) are insanely good. The show itself offers no real value, but if you appreciate great voice talent, then it's a nice way to waste 45 minutes."
B006Y5BWQG I ordered the cd because I love the music - have enjoyed watching this immensely - would recommend it to anyone who likes good music, dancing and a good story"
B006Y5BWQG The actors sing beautifully and most of the songs are fabulous, however the storyline leaves a little to be desired.  It's more like a soap than a drama ... It could've been great if they just worked on the story a bit more ..."
B006Y5BWQG I've rated this once  Nice voices but not a lot of change in plots  Love the voices and the new"
B006Y5BWQG The show must have been incredibly expensive to produce, the song and dance scenes were perfectly choreographed. It was worth watching just to admire all that. Overall the actors did a great job of creating real people. The story line was just 3 stars, but the show was well worth watching."
B006Y5BWQG I was a bit skeptical about this show, because I haven't seen many TV shows that did the musical number thing well. But \"Smash\" pulled it off. It's the classic \"show within a show\" story, which helps a lot. One of my favorite musicals is \"Kiss Me, Kate\" which is a classic of that genre.My wife and I loved the pilot. The characters are interesting, the writing is clever, and there's a good balance of drama and humor. And the song and dance numbers are certainly worthy of Broadway. I read that Spielberg said if the show does well that he wants to actually take the show to Broadway. It would be interested to see if that happens.Give this show a chance. You might get hooked."
B006Y5BWQG Once I got started watching, I couldn't stop.  I watched 2 episodes a day and looked forward to it every day. I hear that the show was cancelled on the network and am FLOORED!!  Here's hoping that something more is down the pike. I spent this weekend watching ALL of Season 2 and now I am bummed."
B006Y5BWQG This is a cute show of what goes on behind the curtain. Nice actors, well done and enjoyed the season,Hurry with season 2 please."
B006Y5BWQG If you love the world of musical theater, you may enjoy this smashing romp aptly titled SMASH.  With a stellar cast including Deborah Messing, Katherine McPhee and Anjelica Huston with Spielberg producing it, there's talent invested in it.The talent is trying to produce a Broadway Musical based on the iconic Marilyn Monroe.  However, there are the usual challenges: inconvenient romances, slimy director, cast rivalry, insufficient financial backing, script rewriting etc. It is great fun to observe the creative process and the chaos surrounding it.  Will they produce a smash hit?  You want to keep watching to see if it will come together."
B006Y5BWQG Gutsy musical/drama with a very talented cast.  It works very well, I liked it greatly.  It was a satisfying experience."
B006Y5BWQG Wonderful show, especially if you're a Broadway musical fan.  Lots of singing and dancing, not to mention great plots.  Katherine McPhee is beautiful, talented, and the show is worth watching just because of her."
B006Y5BWQG This show must have an unlimited budget.  It has an amazing cast with very high production quality of music and dance numbers.  The plot is a little corny.  But I feel like I am really watching a Broadway musical show in the making.  And I have been to enough Broadway shows to know that the tunes, singing, and dancing is just as good in this as in many shows I have seen."
B006Y5BWQG I can not thank you enough for bringing this series to Amazon. I love the music. I will purchase this series in the future. I can not do it now, but thanks to your efforts I can change my life for a littlewhile."
B006Y5BWQG Smash is just that. Best thing I've ever seen Debra Messing do. Cast is amazing! I really do love it..."
B006Y5BWQG Great show. Well written, well performed. I was worried it was going to be like Glee but it's got a much more complex story line. Well worth watching."
B006Y5BWQG Just plain old fun. Anyone who has ever had a connection to theater at any level will love this. Oh, the drama!"
B006Y5BWQG I had heard a lot about Smash and saw the first show of the season on TV. There were so many characters that I was turned off immediately because when there are so many characters it is difficult to keep up and remember who is who.  For some reason I didn't let that stop me when the DVD of the First Season came out--WOWEEEE!!! I can see now why this show got all kinds of good press. I just finished watching the whole season from this morning until tonight.  The story reminds me of the movies long ago about broadway and theatre and rising stars. Katherine McFee has a huge part (remember her in Idol) and she is fantastic. Angelica Houston and Debra Messing are also featured prominently and Jack Davenport (if you never saw COUPLES-GET IT NOW!) and a few other people you will recognize from other shows. The story is a story in  a story regarding developing a musical about Marilyn Monroe (if you don't know who she is you must live under a rock!) and the back biting and all that goes with the making of any broadway show-everyone wants to be the star and it's a fight to the finish. The music is absolutely glorious and I intend to buy the sound track asap. This like some of my other reviews is a joy to watch and again with no special effects and music and dancing throughout the show. The main characters - well they are all main characters and they play them perfectly and once I got into it I had no problem figuring out who was who. I can't wait until Tuesday when the second season starts;... believe me--if you don't see this show you will be missing what I almost missed and this is another series I intend to watch over and over and over! They may be some folks who don't know about Marilyn Monroe and I would suggest they seek out some of her movies so they can see why even more than 50 years have gone by and  she is still a box office hit!!  In one word: FANTABULOUS!!!!"
B006Y5BWQG This first season is very good. The backstage goings on is always enjoyable to see. With the back-stabbing and gossip, you could almost imagine that that really happens."
B006Y5BWQG loved the show.  music was great  sorry there is not more of the series.  looking for another show that is similar."
B006Y5BWQG Fantastic vocals, intriguing drama, hubba hubba romance, who could ask for more?  Okay, some parts of the story lines needed help in season one but those issues were totally forgivable and easily eclipsed by the shows drama, development and music.  Take the the time and enjoy this guilty pleasure.  I sure did."
B006Y5BWQG I don't want to give an episode by episode overview only my though
B006Y5BWQG Fun to watch. There is a lot of dancing and singing. A musical in series format. The grown up Glee."
B006Y5C5XA I'm not someone who would usually watch a musical at all.. But this show has me hooked. I'm hoping for many season too come."
B006Y5C5XA Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.When I saw the promo for this show, I though, \"A TV version of the film Chicago,\" but as I continued watching, I saw that it's more than that. It's Singin' In The Rain meets All About Eve coupled with a unique prespective on show business. Plus, it stars Debra Messing, Katherine McPhee (who is extradorinarily beautiful and has a lovely voice), Jack Davenport (Commadore Norrington in the Pirates Of The Carribean movies) and Academy Award winner Angelica Huston. Besides, Mr. Spielberg himself is behind this drama (he's an executive producer) and THAT, my friends, sealed the deal for me. Anything that has Mr. Spielberg has his name on (with the exception of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Super 8 and the Transformers films, having had to sit through the abominable first installment) I'm willing to give a shot. I recommend this series."
B006Y5C5XA this show has it all, comedy , heartbreak , romance . TALENT BEYOND COMPARE! Can't wait for season two I cant imagine it getting better, but i know it does"
B006Y5C5XA At this shows VERY BEST it`s a 4 stars and at it`s least? 2 stars and that`s being Generous. Now.. if i was from NYC amd REALLY REALLY loved it then i MIGHT give it 3 1/2-4 stars but i am not from NYC. I did have to live there for 2 yrs but that hardly makes me a New Yorker, sorry :)Decent Characters and Decent writing gives the show 3 stars! I had it at 2 stars but at the last mnute raised it to 3. It`s certainly not horrible and I have gotten through Most of the shows uninterupted but i would not go out of my way or miss anything to make sure i watched this.NOW, mst of the Can`t miss shows are the first few seasons of Nurse Jackie but Mainly........ SHAMELESS! Now thats a show that is almost a crime to miss. I have NEVER EVER seen a show or movie that had so many great Characters, Young or Old (I am 53 Years OLD) and the writing, the City and Photography is unbelievavable!!! It would be a \"SHAME\" if their were not 10 seasons of this show made. Not many 1 Hour shows can grab every second of your sttention but this one can.Thats why so may shows are 1/2 hour ones today!!These shows are Way different but put this up there with \"The Wire\", most of \"The Sopranos\", \"OZ\" and so far..... Most of nurse Jackie and Weeds in shows that have Great Characters of all ages, wonderful writing,Almost always Believable in some way, Great Photography ad wonderful all around entertainment!!My Honest suggestion would be to buy or \"Get\" the 2 seasons of Shameless already available and one of any of the others i have mentioned if you have not seen them and start watching. You will end up with all of seasons of all of them and wont be able to wait for the next seasons!!!! That is of course, if it is not finished already.WARNING!!!!This can end up taking alot of your time."
B006Y5C5XA Caught my eye when I saw Katharine McPhee in cast, but the story is keeping me going.  Almost through Season 1 (watching back-to-back).  Recommend!!"
B006Y5C5XA Love watching it on my Kindle. Hope it isn't cancelled anytime soon. I have a problem with that . . . . . get attached to a good show and - voila - it's gone!"
B006Y5C5XA good tv.. but better as DVD... a change from usual weekly TV action and shoot 'em ups.. more complex story and characters.. setting was great fun... music also a welcome change.. season two also a good bet for watching..."
B006Y5C5XA I love this show.  I watched every episode from season one and have watched every episode of season two except for the last one.  It is still on my DVR and I want to savor it; it ended too soon.Given the fact that season one is not yet available in Blu-Ray, I purchased the entire season at Amazon Prime only to find out that the $30.00 I was charged for season one in HD was not in HD at all.  It was easy to tell by the noticeable lack of sharpness and detail in the picture and my A/V receiver, which even tells me what type of sound (Dolby Pro-Logic II, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+, Dolbt Tru-HD, etc ) is being provided by the program material indicated that the sound was only Pro Logic II.  The was a blatant rip off, only compounded by the fact that it has all since become available free for Amazon Prime subscribers.  This is what it is worth: nothing - nothing, that is, beyond the subscription price, a subscription I have made good use of and will continue to do so.  I am just angry and disappointed that something was misrepresented in this way.And yeah, I am a crazy enough fan to purchase both seasons on Blu-Ray, once they become available.  Amazon Prime, in this one instance, did me wrong."
B006Y5D5QG I enjoy British mysteries very much anyway, but they are often very similar in style.  This one is different, thanks to Robbie Coltrane.  He really develops the character, showing all the weaknesses as well as the strengths, and his insights as a psychologist are fascinating.  He is supported by a strong cast, but he steals the show."
B006Y5D5QG Fitz is a complicated character.  His personal problems are interwoven with the crimes he dissolving in a very realistic way.  This is an unusual series - a little out of the ordinary - which makes it quite intriguing."
B006Y5D5QG This is my favorite Masterpiece Mystery series.  A fat, chain-smoking, gambling addict who is passionate and intelligent.  Knows humanity all too well including his own.  Steps over the line in criticizing others but rarely gets away with it as he takes his  share of &#34;the truth&#34; thrown right back at him.  I love that it takes 2 or 3 hours to close one case but it still holds the tension and your attention as he and the detectives all labor to get the job done."
B006Y5D5QG This is a gritty, intense series.  The setting is Manchester, England and the protagonist, Dr \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald, is a flawed psychologist who has issues with drinking, smoking, overeating and gambling.  He is a mess, but he is also talented at working with crime psychology.  He is also quite funny.  In one show he says, \" I drink too much, I smoke too much, I gamble too much. I am too much.\" This is typical of the smart dialogue. The lead actor, Robbie Coltrane, plays him brilliantly.  This is not at all cozy.  It's a dark British procedural with a crime psychologist."
B006Y5D5QG The first shows had too much sound going on and no closed captioning. It was hard to follow. Later they stopped playing music and conversation in the background besides what they were saying. It got easier to understand. Didn't have a rapport yet with the actors."
B006Y5D5QG I was attracted to the series because of the roulette board on the jacket and was not disappointed in my quest to learn more about the profile of the &#34;Gambler.&#34;  The bonus is that the gambler is also insightful, a keen observer and an accomplished psychologist.Good show.  I look forward to completing the series.Peace,Susan"
B006Y5D5QG One must suspend reality and assume psychology is a valid form of &#34;seeing &#34; the human makeup, and that philosophy is nonexistent.  Furthermore, the issue of Volition must be sprinkled loosely but never consistently throughout the plot.  And last but not least, you must take &#34;fat men in charge&#34; as a wonderful thing.Other than these issues, sometimes, the goodness in the plot(s) can actually shine through."
B006Y5DODA Another solid British procedural, better than most all American made series.  However, it isn't Inspector Lewis, Inspector Morse or Foyle's War.  Still, far more worth watching than what we get homemade"
B006Y5DODA I adored this show....what a story of getting through one's life and in the end regretting nothing and still believing in love!"
B006Y5DODA I really enjoy this series with a female lead character in a supervisory role.  She is a good administrator and the show reveals enough of her personal life to really add some depth to her character.  The stories are well developed and the supporting characters are interesting as well.  I like that the series is set in Manchester instead of London, and the British accents are totally understandable to my American ear.  I enjoy gritty and dark series with no personal business to dilute the story lines, but this show is a little lighter and I watch it when I am not ready to see the seamy side of life."
B006Y5DODA How could you not enjoy a great mystery with the main character a mother of four children.  Really good storyline on both her personal and professional levels.  Does not disappoint."
B006Y5DODA All of these are good.  The main character is not your standard size 2 glamour tv/movie cop, but she gets the job done."
B006Y5GHU2 interesting and made me want to come back for another season. I do recommend for mystery lovers to watch. Interesting."
B006Y5GHU2 Another British Police show that is outstanding entertainment and very believeable.  I wish there was another season or two to watch."
B006Y5GHU2 I love Caroline Quentin. I followed the Jonathan Creek series avidly and she was one of the reasons I watched it. Her comedic skills are delightful!  She never overplays her roles. She shines in this series as an overworked cop and mother with a relaxed style which is a joy to watch. Too often such series focus on the violence and the protagonists are forced to reflect that violence. When one watches Blue Murder, one gets the feeling that &#34;Mummy &#34; will make everything better :-)"
B006Y5GHU2 Just don't know if I buy the family setting they have her character in. Some how I can't see a hard nosed detective whose maternal instincts appear to not come easily, would find herself knocked up four times in a short space of time AND STILL MAKE IT TO A HIGH RANKING DETECTIVE GRADE?!?!! BUT, be that as it may, the storylines are solid. Enough twists and turns to keep you coming back for the next installment. Even Quentin maternal instincts improve with time."
B006Y5GHU2 Love British movies and this does not disappoint.  Caroline Quentin really brings her character to life in a real way.  Great show."
B006Y5GHU2 caroline Quentin is so normal.  she plays a single working mom with a brain who is able to handle her job and her children.  I love her."
B006Y5GHU2 We enjoyed to the end. Watching one episode a day keeps the story flow in mind better than waiting a week .  These are likable characters and the the pacing is good."
B006YP42IG Excellent series.  One of sSyfy channels best and I recommend it to everyone.  Includes everything from romance, to suspense and entrigue"
B006YP42IG This is an awesome series and I am so glad that I have it in my collection. Spellbinding story plots for each and every episode that keep you at the edge of your seat wondering what's up next. Great special effects. What a great integration of the three main characters: a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf!"
B006YP42IG Interesting take on a few well known supernatural creatures.  Like the actors a lot.  Can't wait to watch the next season."
B006YP42IG I really have enjoyed watching this season and look forward to many more!  Bring on more full moons, witches and  ghosts!"
B006YP42IG This is a great series with fun and entertaing twists and turns. The humor is so bad that it's good. A good investment of time."
B006YP42IG picks right up from last season and if you liked Season 1 you will like Season 2 (so far at least)"
B006YP42IG I really enjoyed season 1 so I couldn't wait for season 2. I'm glad to see that it has continued to season 3 and I am looking forward to when that comes out.  I could do without the music/songs playing (geared towards the 18-25 group) and they do get a little graphic sometimes. B
B006YP42IG I love monster movies.  Always have.  I probably always will.  As a critic, I tend to give them a bit of a pass when it comes to being hard on them, and that's because I have such a soft spot for them in my heart and mind.  There's something noble about exploring the highs and lows of `the creature'; usually, it's `a creature' not of its own creation, and that almost always implies that the audience is going to go soft on the character.  Plus - by its very nature - `the creature' is almost always the underdog in the stories where it appears because there's always the menace known as `mankind' seeking to wipe it from the face of the Earth.  Such is life.But, for whatever reason, BEING HUMAN just never struck a chord with me.  I couldn't say why specifically, but I'll try to highlight why I think it failed to light my fire if you're interested.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)From the production materials: \"Leading everyday lives is harder than it looks for three twenty-something supernatural roommates - vampire Aidan (Sam Witmer), ghost Sally (Meaghan Rath) and werewolf Josh (Sam Huntington).  Together, they share the creature comforts of a Boston brownstone while struggling to resist the temptations of their true natures and keep their secrets hidden from the outside world.\"As I said, monsters are a rare breed.  Even rarer are monsters that you want to get to know personally - i.e. how they live, who they share apartments with, what their day-to-day life looks like.  What's compelling about the standard monster story is that it's just trying to be what it is, whether that means feeding on human flesh or terrorizing a small town once every full moon.  We don't all that much care how a monster `goes to work' as its alter-ego.  We aren't all that much interested in how a monster balances daycare and shopping and Twitter.  When the monster becomes too human - such as is the case in a program titled BEING HUMAN - the element of being truly scared of what it is gets largely marginalized in favor of some crafty storytelling that kinda/sorta reduces the monster to gimmickry (that's my two cents, and I'm standing by it).Now, this isn't to say that BEING HUMAN isn't smartly written or even relevant for its times.  Rather, I'd argue on its behalf that its principle players - Witmer, Rath, and Huntington - are probably the greatest source of the program's appeal.  They're all likeable.  They certainly flesh out their respective `creatures' as best as the writing allows.  What they're given to explore - humanity versus their decided inhumanity; obedience to a greater code of conduct pertaining to their possible `clans'; relationships with significant others - has, however, been explored often enough (quite probably, there's some facet of it in every legitimate monster movie), so I'm not sure how impactful the program can be in the long run.Perhaps this is because, as a person, I'm largely a bit more cynical than most.  I tend to think that the monster inevitably wins out (and not the man) in memorable monster movies, and that ultimately leads to the monster's destruction.  Could it be that putting a human face on the monster just isn't for my tastes?  It's possible, though I think that, of the three regulars, Witmer is given the best meat to chew on here (maybe that's limited to just Season 2, for all I know).  All-in-all, BEING HUMAN still succeeds in delivering the program its intended to be; maybe I was just hoping for something a bit more ... dark?BEING HUMAN: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is produced by Muse Entertainment Enterprises (as Muse Entertainment), Zodiak USA, Quebec Film and Television Tax Credit, and Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit.  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One (E One).  The program airs in the U.S. on Syfy.  As for the technical specifications, it looks and sounds very solid; the cinematography is a bit predictable, but there are some nice touches with flashbacks that explore the background of several of these characters.  The special features are surprisingly slim for a program still in production, and the set only boasts a Season 2 making of featurette, a few behind-the-scenes interviews, and the cast's appearance at San Diego Comic-Con 2012; not bad, just - like I said - a bit thin.RECOMMENDED.  While I have absolutely no reservation pointing out that BEING HUMAN just wasn't for me, I've also absolutely no problems giving it a `thumbs up' for a general audience.  It has admirable production qualities, a fairly winning cast, and a reasonable investment in story and characters.  I tend to prefer my monster stories with more `monster,' though, not a group of twentysomethings struggling to fit in.  Still, it's a novel concept, and I've no doubt there are people who love its bark and its bite just fine.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with a DVD copy of BEING HUMAN: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B006YP42IG I like this show so much, I went back and watched the first season when it came to Prime. I can't wait for the third season to come now!This show is one of the reasons it's impossible to successfully create a vampire-only story anymore. A vampire, a ghost, and werewolf take up house, and though they each have their problems being human, they rely on each other and help each other to stay strong and carry on.This is a great paranormal show that is definitely worth watching. I highly recommend to paranormal fans."
B006YP42IG THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.I really enjoyed the first season of \"Being Human\", and I rated it five stars. This second season was a big step down for me, even though the production levels remain high, and the stories are quite engaging, for the most part.So why was I letdown? Because two of the three \"protagonists\" have become true monsters, and unlikable in my eyes. Aidan has returned to being an unrepentant serial killer, who occasionally loses control and offs a few innocents. Yet, the writers of this show consistently display him in what is supposed to be an empathetic, heroic light... but how am I supposed to empathize with a monster who kills innocent people for his own benefit, or that of his friends? Likewise, Sally has become something of a \"serial killer\" in the ghostly realm, though her crimes are even worse, since her victims are sent to a limbo that is described as \"similar to hell\". Again, her reasons for doing so are all driven by selfishness and disregard for the well-being of others. And again, the writers expect the audience to empathize with her, and a good deal of the story arcs deal with her \"redemption\". I just don't get it... and it's too bad, because I truly liked these two characters in the first season.The final character of the trio, Josh, remains the sole bright spot of this series. Josh is just as goofy and lovable as he's always been, and unlike his monstrous associates, he remains guided by a strong moral compass. He doesn't always get it right, but he tries his darnedest to avoid harming innocents, regardless of what might best serve his own interests. It could be argued that this huge divide between the characters is by design, but I just don't buy it. The only way that could be true is if Josh parted company with Sally and Aidan, but the writers of this show remain committed to trying to display a bizarre, heroic light upon the true monsters, as they seek \"redemption\", willfully crushing the lives of innocents that stumble into their paths.Nontheless, this show still has its merits (most notably, Josh), which is why I rate it three stars. I'm not yet certain if I'll invest my time in the third season."
B006YP42IG Season 2 is much better than the first season, cast better developed, and better story lines. If you just want to be entertained, get it."
B006YP42IG Season one repeated the English episodes but in season 2 they make the story their own. It really takes the characters into a different direction and they make the show their own."
B006YP42IG Having watched every season of the British hit \"Being Human,\" I was a bit wary of SyFy's American reinterpretation. While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I didn't fully appreciate its charms until it progressed into later seasons and got darker and more complex.  In Season One of the American version, I had a similar reaction.  Once again, I found myself thinking that this was a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television and I thought that the U.S. version had the same opportunity.  And in Season Two's thirteen new episodes, I really enjoyed the deepening seriousness of the story's plot threads.For those new to the concept of \"Being Human,\" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama, try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun.  But where there was much humor and lightness in introductory episodes, Season Two is looking a whole lot bleaker.Sam Witwer, as the vampire, must deal with the repercussions of last season's dramatic decisions.  He is embroiled with a former flame, clan politics, and a new penchant for blood-letting.  You get a lot more back story, a lot more depth, and Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington (our resident werewolf), who spent much of Season One as comic relief, also has richer material to sink his teeth into.  He also starts to deal with the dynamics of werewolf politics, and the fact that he's turned his love into a beast of the night makes for some of the year's more intense confrontations.  Both Witwer and Huntington are terrific!  I'm still not as enthralled by Meaghan Rath's ghost.  Rath is an appealing and pleasant apparition, but her third of the story lines just don't intrigue me as much as the other two.  In the end, though, the three share a believable chemistry that will have you rooting for them.  In terms of the supporting cast in this season, Kristen Hager is a great counterpoint to Huntington and I liked the addition of Kyle Schmid as a past protege of Witwer.DVD Extras:The DVD release has all thirteen episodes along with some fairly unremarkable extras.  There is a \"making-of\" featurette, some behind-the-scenes interviews and (my favorite) the show's 2012 presence at Comic-Con.  I liked Season One, but I appreciate Season Two much more fully.  KGHarris, 12/12."
B006YP42IG I wasn't sure about an American version of this since I enjoyed the British one so much, but it takes on some different challenges and twists than the British one did and is done quite well.  Very impressed."
B006YP42IG i loved it just wish the show was still on! i think it  comes back in january but all around awesome show"
B006YP42IG this show continues to peek my entrest so many highs and lows it's enough to make want talk back to freak'n television so that's why i continue to watch it"
B006YP42IG One of the greats modern sci fi dramas ever.  It makes you reexamine your own humanity and what it means to be &#34;alive&#34;."
B006YP42IG I wish there were more free episodes, I really like the series and the dynamic between the actors it just seemed &#34;right&#34; from the very first season."
B006YP42IG Season 2 is much better than season 1, but still not nearly as good as the British version. The British version is so brooding and dark. I do love the setting in the US version. The city and house are great."
B006YP42IG I purchased this Season because I missed it on TV. It's on SyFi!!  I have to say I'm really a fan of the series. Now I'm a Prime Member so, I get to watch a lot of free movies and TV series. If you watch a lot of TV and Movies, the I recommend you get a Prime membership. Buy the way with a Prime Membership I don't pay for shipping on most of the things I purchase.."
B006YP42IG I like this series so I have been buying them as they come out for sale. It is a great series."
B006YP42IG I was very surprised by this series. Tried it thinking I would cringe and turn it off. I was joyfully surprised by the acting, writing and chemistry in it. I became addicted to it while watching it on Amazon. Not having cable tv, I now pay for each episode of season 4 (yes having loved season 3 as well!). It is good to watch something with good family values such as  the bonds of Friendship, loyalty honor and love. Human positive values. Go watch the first episode and get addicted in a very fun clean way (despite a bit of blood here and there ;-) )"
B006YP42IG I liked the British version but this is actually a really good version too. Highly recommend. Plus its free on prime."
B006YP42IG The video quality is excellent (HD). You just have to make sure that you have a good connection. I love the show. I have been hooked ever since it came out. It is my True Blood (but totally different) when True Blood is on its year long hiatus. Great Show!"
B006YP42IG This is one of the best series that the Sy Fy channel has ever developed. It is based on a BBC series of the same name (check it out too) but with a distinctly American flavor. Basically it is about a vampire, ghost, and werewolf that all live together. All are attempting to stay in touch with whatever humanity they have left since they are basically all monsters and know it. I started watching this series when it first came out and I buy each season as it becomes available. If you are into horror and humor then check it out, this show has both!"
B006YP42IG I like this series, it depicts how hard life can be even when your part of the supernatural world. (it the same for those of us in the mundane world)"
B006YP42IG This show really keeps you wanting more. The graphics are great and the show keeps you thinking. Great writers!Can't wait for the next seasons surprises."
B006YP42IG I had viewed the original BBC version of this series & had thought it would be a 'knock off' version & would not be as good, but to my surprise, even though the episode storylines were similar, the Canadian version was as interesting & had its own twists. The directors & actors brought differences to the characters of the vampire, werewolf & ghost trying to live 'normal' lives."
B006YZSC3C Its a good show that is entertaining.I think the writing is missing a few key scenarios and plot twists in each episode."
B006YZSC3C JJ Abrahms, the creator of the long-running suspense serial Lost starts a new series with elements of mystery, magic and police procedural, however, those looking for realistic procedural should look elsewhere but those looking for serial mysterious suspense should be right at home.Alcatraz, arguably America's most famous prison was closed in 1963 with all inmates transferred, but that isn't what happened the opening voiceover informs us. Instead, the prisoners and guards disappeared into the ether and were never seen again. Until 50 years later when the criminals start reappearing, unaged and unchanged and committing the horrendous crimes they were incarcerated for.A young detective with a family connection to Alcatraz catches the first homicide connected with the mysteriously reappearing prisoners. Of course no one else knows this and she figures it out fairly quickly with the help of an Alcatraz historian, Dr. Soto. The detective and Dr. Soto stumble on a mysterious organization tasked with catching the prisoners as the reappear and finding out what happened in the first place. The viewer is given hints that this organization is not all that it seems and that the prisoners may have been the subject of medical experiments that may or may not be related to the current predicament.Perfect combination of weekly arcs for new viewers and longer arcs for those who like to follow a mystery. Mr. Abrahms excells at grab you by the throat openings but sometimes has trouble with middle and last acts. Viewers will have to see if Alcatraz follows this pattern or breaks it. Intriguing and worth a look."
B006YZSC3C It's too bad that Alcatraz was cancelled after its first year due to low viewing. Seems that American TV is doomed to be dumbed down forever.One can still get it online fortunately. It's offbeat, sinister, and really weird. It's also well acted and directed. It's as much sci-fi as a crime story. We'll now never know why things happened, but I can think of a few things which I don't want to share and spoil this show for readers.The one criticism I have of the show is that every episode runs a bit too strictly to pattern, sort of like &#34;Dragnet.&#34; But &#34;Dragnet&#34; lasted for years, as this should have. There was much room for development and growth."
B006YZSC3C Here we go again! Another good show gets buried alive. Im sure some brain-dead \"reality\" show will get its slot.I enjoyed the premise and the mystery of the mass escape of the former Alcatraz prisoners. They suddenly start showing up in 2011-2012 at the same age they \"disappeared\" nearly 50 years later. Few if any know how or why this is happening and I was ready to wait for the story to unfold but appearently im the only one. The show was over before it got started.Dear: AmericaWhen most tv shows go on air it is a story designed to be told over a 5 year period. It's called \"the bible\"! Every show has one and that's the norm. Each season has an arc and a goal and in the end all of the arcs add up to the main story. Why aren't we willing to wait for the story? I dont get it.With all being said I have learned, a long time ago, not to judge a show to harshly on it's 1st season alone. Some shows have scetchy 1st seasons and later turn into fantastic shows some of which I own today.Im not part of this age of instant gratification \"stream everything\" generation. In fact I hate the word \"streaming\"! It's all low quality substandard crap anyway and I prefer to keep what I buy - like Blu-Ray discs for example. I want the best of the best. I looked foward to this show and once again I was robbed by people who dont know good tv when they see it.FRAK ALL YOU HATERS!!!"
B006YZSC3C Wow!  This one keeps adding more and more twists to it.  It is suspense and CSI all together.  Love it."
B006YZSC3C before ordering this series,i have neverseen this..to my surprise its a very good season and i was very happy with it.good customer service,great condition,would buy from them agian."
B006YZSC3C I really enjoyed the series.  It ended on cliffhanger which led me to believe it would return for a second season .  I went online to search for more information and found none.  I will be very disappointed if it does not return.  Sam Neil is outstanding in their suffering role of man with too many responsibilities on his mind.  The plot is very versatile and always refreshing.  Ideally hope it returns."
B006YZSC3C I found this show totally by accident, decided to give it a try. I found it very enjoyable, I watched the whole season in 3 days. I found the format very intriguing. I look forward to next season!"
B006YZSC3C Phooey! I just got really interested in this story line and now find that the series was not continued. So we don't know who, when, what, where, or why. Bummer.But I have enjoyed the episodes that are available. JJ Abrams has some fantastic ideas."
B006YZSC3C This show is interesting enough, but a bit amiss in that none of the characters press for an explanation of why none of the 63 have aged, nor what really happened to them in the interim.  That aside the show was fun to watch, and the acting and back stories worked well, keeping it intriguing.  Too bad the show got canceled before it got a chance to pick up the pace and spread its wings story wise."
B006YZSC3C show was short lived so no answers were really given as to the disappearance and reappearance of the inmates and others there."
B006YZSC3C This is one of the best paranormal type shows on a major network in years, the cast is great, the stories are riveting and they keep you guessing many times as to who the actual bad guys really are.  Hope it lasts for years."
B006YZSC3C The Fox midseason replacement TV series \"Alcatraz\" is built around the fascinating premise that the 1963 closure of the notorious federal prison was a cover story for the sudden and unexplained disappearance of the inmates and their guards.  San Francisco police detective Rebecca Madsen (Sarah Jones) becomes involved in the mystery when her partner is killed by a man who is supposed to be dead, one of the missing \"63's\".  Rebecca is recruited into a secretive federal task force run by FBI agent Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill), formerly an Alcatraz guard and now in search of the former inmates as they resurface in modern-day San Francisco to resume their criminal careers, mysteriously unaged and still fully lethal.The story is told on parallel tracks, as Hauser, Rebecca, and Rebecca's unlikely partner Dr. Diego \"Doc\" Soto (Jorge Garcia) pursue the criminals in the present, while their backstories are told in flashback.  The hulking Doc, a comic book store owner and expert on Alcatraz, forms a surprisingly effective team with the diminutive but spunky Rebecca, tracking the \"63's\" while trying to figure out what secrets Hauser might be hiding in his underground command center on Alcatraz.  Each show dropped fresh clues on how and why the inmates might have disappeared, and suggest a conspiracy at work.  Each show also expands on the separate and somewhat conflicting agendas of Hauser and Rebecca.  The series makes full use of its excellent San Francisco and Alcatraz filming venues, including a spectacular \"Bullit\" car chase scene in the season finale.\"Alcatraz\" is something different, part dark police procedural, part science fiction mystery, and all fun.  The season finale was a fast-paced and terrifying cliff-hanger; here's hoping the series gets a second season.  Highly recommended."
B006YZSC3C Is this a series with a story line that gets divulged through the episodes? Or a drama in which each episode has a self-contained story? I do not know and I suspect that the producers/directors don't know either. In an attempt to promote a second season, the ending is totally unexpected and leaves you with a feeling of &#34;job not done&#34;."
B006YZSC3C \"Alcatraz\" was a pleasant surprise.  The show, which takes place in both the present and the past, stars Sam Neill, Jorge Garcia (Hugo from the \"Lost\" series) and Robert Forster, along with Sarah Jones, Parminder Nagra (from \"ER\") and Leon Rippy (\"Leverage,\" \"Saving Grace\" and \"Deadwood\").  Neill plays Emerson Hauser who, it turns out, used to work in conjuction with Alcatraz and, now, much older heads a small team of people who are awaiting the return of Alcatraz inmates and staff who, it turns out, all mysteriously disappeared when the prison was closed back in the early 60s.  Hauser, however, is rather secretive and hides much from his team, making you wonder whether he's good, bad or both.In present day, the inmates and staff begin reappearing (unaged) in the San Francisco area, picking up where they left off (i.e. doing signature crimes, etc.) but also, apparently, executing additional, unaffiliated agendas (acquiring certain items, killing certain people) that they were programmed or brainwashed into doing between the time they disappeared and the time they reappeared.A well-done science-fiction mystery show that keeps you guessing and coming back for more.  Recommended.March 28, 2012 update: And get this, the Season 1 finale has a car chase in it with a modern Mustang chasing a modern Dodge Charger.  The writers were obviously paying homage to Steve McQueen's \"Bullitt.\""
B006YZSC3C I truly liked the series but it appears that there was never an ending and the series just ended. In other words the series just left me hanging looking for more and I never got it."
B006YZSC3C Note: I just saw the entire first season with XFinity On Demand.Alcatraz. The most infamous prison in the world. The worst scumbags in the United States Of America are housed here. On March 21, 1963, a convoy was sent to pick them up, as Alcatraz officially closed due to unsafe conditions. But when the guards arrive, no one is inside. Why? Now, in 2012, the inmates are returning. One by one. Why?These questions, and more, form the unique premise of Alcatraz. Sam Niell (who could very well have also played James Bond at the same time Pierce Brosnan did) stars as Emerson Hauser, an FBI agent bent on catching all of the prisoners. Jorge Garcia (\"Lost\") also stars as Diego Soto, an expert on Alcatraz. Like Hauser, he is also baffled by why the inmates are returning. Sarah Jones stars as Rebecca Madsen, a cop who unwittingly has a connection to one of the prisoners...And Parminder Nagra (\"Bend It Like Beckham\") stars as Dr. Lucy Banerjee, a colleague of Hauser who may or may not be connected to Alcatraz...The series is engaging, from the two-hour pilot to the action-packed and emotionally gripping two-part season finale. Equal part drama and action, the series deftly balances both. My only question is, did they have to cast a fat guy as Rebecca's partner? Some romantic tension in the series between the two main leads would be nice.I hope the series is renewed for a second season.EDIT-5/11/11I found out last night that Alcatraz has officially been closed...for good. Which is unfortunate, as it was good from the two-part pilot episode until the two-part season finale, and the mysteries just kept coming on strong. Bad move, FOX."
B006YZSC3C I noticed that this series received quite a few high marks from reviewers, and many were puzzled why the series was canned. I do not understand the high marks, but there are good reasons why the show was dumped. It is slow, there is hardly any plot development, and the acting was marginal at best. The parts I liked the most were the scenes of SF and the N CA area. Other than that, the series is another \"Lost\"-type thing, and \"Lost\" was virtually unintelligible."
B006YZSC3C While this is a review for the first and, sadly, the only season of J.J. Abrams' ALCATRAZ, this will also be, in part, a rant against Fox Broadcasting and how quickly they forgot their roots.Let's begin with the review though. First, a quick rundown of the plot: Back in March of 1963, Alcatraz officially closed. All the prisoners were transferred to other prisons. This is the official story, but it's not the way it happened. In actuality, 256 inmates of Alcatraz as well as 46 guards mysteriously vanished and no one knows where... until now, that is. Mysterious and shadowy Federal Agent Emerson Hauser (the terrifically underrated Sam Neill) appears in San Francisco just around the time that our main protagonist SFPD Detective Rebecca Madsen (the talented and lovely Sarah Jones, who doesn't have a lot of credits to her name) loses her partner to a fleeing suspect. Madsen comes into direct contact and conflict with what Agent Hauser is trying to do when two men are murdered in the same day by a man who was one of the vanishing convicts and also looks exactly the same as he did in 1963. Enlisted in the search for this killer is the cuddly, lovable and very intelligent comic geek man-child Dr. Diego Soto (Jorge Garcia aka Hurley from LOST) who is considered to have written the definitive works on Alcatraz and its inmates. Along with Hauser's assistant, Dr. Lucy Banerjee (the talented and lovely Parminder Nagra, who first made a splash as the co-star of BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM and then onto ER), they form something of a secret task force to find the rest of the missing \"63's\".However, as with LOST, we have flashbacks as well to when the prison was still active, and secrets aplenty during that timeframe, kept primarily by Warden Edwin James (a terrific Jonny Coyne), who is a man of seemingly infinite patience and a sadistic streak a mile wide. Also joining the cast from time to time is Ray Archer (the great Robert Forster), who is Rebecca's uncle and a former guard at Alcatraz who ALSO has some secrets in his past. The cast is terrific, and the characters as we come to know them are extremely engaging. The scene-stealer though is always Coyne as Warden James, who has a kindly and almost beatific smile while he's twisting the knife even further into his inmates. His presence alone is tremendously unnerving.The big questions, as with LOST (which is really the best analogue for this show), are who, what,  where and why: What is responsible for the disappearences; Who are some of these escapees working for; Where did they go; and of course, Why is all of this happening? Sadly, unlike LOST, this was a program that had a pretty big start but viewership cooled enough that by the end of the first season, despite a really terrific thirteen episodes and one heck of a season finale, Fox decided to drop it, leaving far too many questions unanswered, namely all of the ones I just listed.Now, I can understand that there are a few problems with this show that need to be addressed, and probably would have been improved upon in the second season. First and most importantly is that this show, while being a lot like LOST, wasn't quite enough like LOST. Over the past several years, there have been a glut of procedural crime thrillers/dramas that have come down the TV pipelines and one that has a sci-fi \"what if\" type of concept wasn't quite enough to differentiate itself from the dozens of others that are still on, for good (BURN NOTICE, PERSON OF INTEREST) or ill (any incarnation of LAW AND ORDER, CSI, or NCIS). Secondly, the show, being only 13 episodes, making way for a mid-season replacement if it wasn't up to snuff for the network that has the biggest show on right now and the lowest production costs (AMERICAN IDOL... argh) needed one of those answers answered. LOST was such a brilliant show all the way up through the end (despite the legions of nay-sayers) because it owned its strangeness and it gave us a large number of characters that we cared about. ALCATRAZ, because it took a procedual drama tack in the midst of all the bizarre goings-on, lost part of that edge and started to lose viewership because the characters were sparse and we just weren't terribly invested in Rebecca Madsen's life because the show wasn't invested either. One thing the show absolutetly did right though was understanding that this was a show that lived and died by its main characters, and while the life of Det. Madsen wasn't very interesting, the lives of Hauser and Doc were interesting enough to keep a forward momentum going. You didn't simply love Doc because he was Hurley from LOST; this was a new character with a new backstory and Garcia really makes the most of it. Sam Neill plays the hell out of Hauser as well. Being a cryptic and mysterious Fed seems to be a staple of J.J. Abrams TV, and he really works this character hard to the point where you care about him despite the fact that he's not very likable.So while I believe that this show didn't fail from a story, script or acting standpoint, the major letdown was that it didn't let its freak flag fly, like FRINGE or LOST did. ALCATRAZ was pretty darn good television, but it also just wasn't ambitious enough.Fox obviously has a history of doing this to better shows than this, such as EVERY program that had the name Tim Minear as a producer/creator (FIREFLY being the most glaring example, but also his other shows he was involved in like THE INSIDE, DRIVE, and THE CHICAGO CODE), and a great many other shows in favor of its more insipid programs like AMERICAN IDOL, SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE?, and any number of the other \"reality\" flavored brands it has out there. FRINGE was it for a really long time and that's getting axed too, but that could simply be because it ran its course. But what Fox doesn't remember is its roots. The show that really seemed to put Fox on the map and make it Stay-at-home viewing was THE X-FILES. It was the ultimate slow-burn show, ratings-wise, and it gave this network a name and a brand. Sadly, the show did decline severely in its last two years, but there's no reason that a show like SVU can stay on for 15 seasons and shows like ALCATRAZ only get one, and not even a complete one at that. This show might have found a better home elsewhere, but I guess we'll never know.All in all, for people who actually watched this show when it was on, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the episodes again, but for people just experiencing this for the first time on home video, ALCATRAZ might be an exercise in fuming frustration and leave you screaming for answers after you watch the last episode.That's not to say that it's not worth the scream."
B006YZSC3C This was a great show. Had awesome &#34;lost&#34; type potential with the built-in plots of each of the missing inmates. Sad they cancelled it as we were looking forward to this season."
B006YZSC3C I wished the show was never cancelled .. So they could have finished the show b
B006YZSC3C I catched some episodes by chance on German TV and decided to buy the complete season. I like the character played by Jorge Garcia, plus the story itself was promising. But - due to whatever reason - the series should not get more than this one season with a handful of episodes. Therefore, the ending is not really satisfactory. Although they try to give some answers and explanations, but it feels like &#34;we must end the story within one episode&#34;. What started with great expectations could not fulfil them in the end. Anyway, it is a good recommendation, the single episodes are thrilling!"
B006YZSC3C I watched it when it was shown on TV but was not that excited at first. As the episodes continued I became more involved wondering what had occurred and what was the driving force behind the disappearance of the 63s. Then the network pulled the plug and left us all hanging. Still. it is a good show to watch. Because of this, I have become a fan of Jorge Garcia and look forward to his appearances on Hawaii 50."
B006YZSC3C This show keeps you on your toes and trying to figure out what really happened.  Only really downer to this is that it ends on a cliff hanger and you don't know what will happen.  I would like to see the rest, even if they have to make a movie to end it."
B006YZSC3C Catching up on some of the TV series I was unable to follow this season, Alcatraz was first on my list. I found this to be a very entertaining series and enjoyed it very much. There was an unrequited love, action, mystery, drama in each and every one. So sorry to hear that this series is not continuing, since they have so many prisoners to find. The cast was outstanding...which led to my disappointment on how the last episode ended. Looking forward to more!"
B006YZSC3C I really enjoyed this show.Premise: the \"official\" story is that Alcatraz closed in 1963 due to high maintenance costs and it being run down, so the prisoners were all relocated, but in truth they all just disappeared one day without a trace... some 50 years later they are mysteriously coming back, not having aged a day since 1963 and not knowing what happened to them - they just seem to pop back into reality. They are also provisioned and seem to each have been given a mission by someone. These criminals have to be caught quickly and \"under the radar\" (as how could their existence possibly be explained?  They were all \"officially\" dead, complete with death certificates etc. in the official records - and how do you explain the not aging?)So, there is an FBI agent (who used to be a guard at Alcatraz) with a secret team of helpers, the old shifty doctor from Alcatraz, an Asian woman shrink trying to catch and re-imprison them. [The Asian woman was evidently one of the first of the missing Alcatraz people to \"come back\"]. They base their operation out of Alcatraz, in areas off limits to tourists.  They enlist the help of a female police detective (granddaughter to a key 1963 Alcatraz prisoner) who makes them also agree to a partner she picks. She picks a guy who is a comic book writer/illustrator, with a doctorate (he is something of a genius) who had written books on Alcatraz - the leading authority on everything Alcatraz. He seems to be the moral compass of the group, reminding the others that someday their task will be done and they will have to live with whatever they did.The episodes flow back and forth between showing Alcatraz in the early '60s and in the present, so you get background on things that were going on as well as back stories on each prisoner they're trying to catch, and what that prisoner is up to now. Usually focusing on 1 returned prisoner at a time, but towards the end of season 1 there are multiple in play at a time as the story builds.As long as you just go with it and not wonder if they were really allowed certain privileges or if the guards really behaved like that, or why this prisoner was at the prison for \"the worst of the worst\" instead of any other prison etc. it works. The stories/episodes are interesting and there are plenty of mysteries to be solved over time so the show held my interest.Decent story idea, decent scripts and acting - holds your interest.  Hopefully season 2 will be as good (on many shows, after a great first season, the writers get all squirrely and do not live up to the first season in my book) -- fingers crossed!  I'm looking forward to the solving of the mysteries."
B006YZSC3C This show was entertaining, but that's it.  There was nothing gripping about it and I can honestly see why it was never picked up for a second season.  It's worth watching but nothing more."
B006YZSC3C Enjoyed this series a lot and would watch again. Thank you for bring us content like this in Amazon. I Enjoy the plot of this series."
B006YZSC3C Alcatraz - Complete SeriesSummary:On March 21, 1963, 256 inmates and 46 guards disappeared from the Alcaltraz supposedly transferred to another prison but as we are informed that's not exactly what happened. They just &#34;poof&#34; disappeared and now in 2012 are coming back! That's the central premise of this show and quite frankly it is extremely difficult to accept as a premise. The cast plays this situation dead serious as if this truly happened. No lawyers', family member, curious reporters or prisoner advocates apparently inquired where the heck everyone went!The series was a mid-season replacement premiered on January 16, 2012. The show was cancelled by the network, Fox,  on May 9, 2012.Content & Packaging:3 disks - 13 episodes - standard DVD packaging. One critical note the 3 disks are not identified as disk 1, disk 2 etc.Positive Comments:I have to give the creative talents their due. There weren't any campy smirks or a wink at the camera - this preposterous story line was played dead serious by the cast.The Cast:Some of the characters were just terrific and should have been recognized with an award but were not. Jonny Coyne is the warden - in his black suit and devilish moon face captivated me as he smoozed with the prisoners to achieve his private ends. Jorge Garcia was a hoot. This very large man who abhors violence and gore gets himself into the thick of the action without make a fool of himself.Negative Comments:Alcaltraz presents a very convoluted plot.Cryptic events and conversations happen in one episode that has no apparent significance.You cannot miss a single episode or you will by very confuse.Excessive blood and gore and violence against women detracted from the series in my opinion.Recommendations:Aside from my negative comments I liked this show. The individual stories have some dramatic intensity at times and trying to put all the clues together appealed to me. Nonetheless I can well understand why viewers fled this series - it was just too much weirdness!"
B006YZSC3C This series had so much promise. It was obviously planned for more than one season with the premise of tracking down some 63 inmates one at a time who disappeared from The Rock back in the 1960's. Unfortunately it lasted only one season. Each prisoner had his own &#34;story&#34; and there was an ongoing sub-plot involving the 1960's warden and some dark medical experiments being conducted in the prison. We will never know the outcome since the series disappeared just as the prisoners had. Perhaps it will reappear in 50 years. One can always hope."
B006YZSC3C It was a very interesting series.  My only complaint was that its over.  I guess it did not get renewed."
B006YZSC3C A bit of history and a lot of underlying plots with a side of old guyscovering up their crazy mistakes.  Way out there but very watchable"
B006YZSC3C This is a show that was a different concept.Everyone from alcatraz is missing for something like 40 or 50 years, then one by one tthey start showing up again, but they haven't aged, and if they were bad before they still are now.Sorry that this series was cacelled."
B006YZSC3C A midseason replacement on the FOX Network, the crime drama Alcatraz (2012), was cancelled after 12 episodes were produced.  Although the series has an outlandish premise, and some of the stories follow a particular pattern, the program features fast paced action, a time bending story structure, interesting characters, ruthless villains, and a level of violence is often strikingly graphic for network television.Alcatraz prison was closed down by the Federal government in 1963.  The premise of the series, executive produced by J.J. Abrams (Alias, Lost,Star Trek), is that rather than closing, 256 prisoners and 46 guards at Alcatraz, mysteriously vanished without a trace.  Emerson Hauser, a young police officer, was one of the first to discover the disappearance in 1963.The FBI has anticipated that the 302 persons who vanished, referred to as \"the 63\", might someday return.  In 2012, Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill), now an FBI agent, is heading an operation tasked with handling the unique situation.  The pilot episode shows how SFPD detective Rebecca Madsen (Sarah Jones), and Dr. Diego \"Doc\" Soto (Jorge Garcia), owner of a comic book store, and an expert on Alcatraz, become part of Hauser's operation, which is based at a secret facility on \"the Rock\".When one of \"the 63\" return to the present, they are the same age as when they vanished, and the ex-cons soon return to their criminal ways.  Each episode usually involves the team's pursuit of one or more criminals, in the Bay Area.  Intertwined with the investigation, are flashbacks of past crimes and events at Alcatraz.  Over time, the connection between the past and the present becomes clearer, as characters such as Edwin James (Jonny Coyne), the enigmatic warden of Alcatraz in the early 60's, become integrated into the program's mythos.Jorge Garcia, who worked previously with Abrams in Lost (2004-10), is great as the eclectic and highly intelligent \"Doc\".  The tough, smart female officer with a dark past has become almost a clich&eacute;, but Sarah Jones does it well, and without forced bravado.  The dynamic of the Madsen/Solo team is a cornerstone of the series, and the untraditional partnership is an interesting one.Sam Neill (Event Horizon,Jurassic Park) brings huge gravitas to Hauser, who while calling the shots, is trying to manage the situation to suit his agenda.  Alcatraz features some wild storylines, and Hauser's powerful personality helps to pull things together, and smooth over some of the rough spots.  The supporting cast is very solid, particularly on the medical front, with Parminder Nagra (Bend It Like Beckham), Leon Rippy, and Jeananne Goossen, all playing medical personnel.Disappointingly, the series ends on a huge cliffhanger, and leaves most of the key questions unanswered.  While the premise of a mass disappearance is farfetched, the series does make the fantasy interesting and exciting, as the action scenes are crisp, and the violence often quite brutal for television.  As the season progress, the stories display more diversity and creativity than the more straightforward \"catch the fugitive of the week\" episodes featured at the start.  Although the writing may have gained momentum, by then ratings had fallen, and unfortunately Alcatraz's fate was sealed, leaving a key character in limbo, and several potentially provocative story arcs unexplored.  Another example of a worthy program, that just didn't find an audience soon enough.Alcatraz is currently available to Prime members in HD, and is well worth viewing.  The stories are interesting, production values are high, and the acting is excellent, but be prepared for a story that has little romance, and is ultimately unfinished, with a conclusion that will probably not be very pleasing.  Although with good DVD sales and huge fan support, who knows, a \"Serenity\" type windup might be a possibility."
B006YZSC3C Alcatraz was one of the great disappointments of the last tv season. Produced by J.J. Abrams, who until now could almost do no wrong, expectations for it were high. The pilot and first couple of episodes did a good job establishing the world, its mysteries, and really getting you excited to see where they were going with it. Unfortunately, the many of the questions posed in the pilot are never answered by the end of the season.How did the inmates get to the present? Never answered. What was the wardens ultimate plan? We still don't know. What was the deal with the doctor? No answers. This was the shows biggest flaw; far too many questions with practically no answers. The finale, while thrilling, actually raises a whole host of questions, without answering any.This is very unfortunate considering how GOOD many of these episodes were. Make no mistake, lack of answers aside, this is still a show worth watching. The inmates in Alcatraz range from sympathetic to outright brutal, and the show was not afraid to get its hands dirty. Ernest Cobb, Paxton Petty, Webb Porter, and Kit Nelson are especially dangerous criminals who are featured in some of the series best episodes.The team of Rebecca Madsen and Doc Soto is a handled well, though Jorge Garcia is never quite given enough to do. Sam Neil does a great job as agent Hauser, though at a certain point it feels that his character is keeping secrets just for the sake of it. Parminder Nagra as Lucy is probably the most interesting character in the series outside of the ever enigmatic Warden himself.At the end of the day, the slow burn tactic Abrams used withFringe: The Complete First Season (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray] was ill suited for this series, which thrived when it was allowed to be the tense thrill ride that it always should have been. Alcatraz was a good show in its own right and should have been allowed to find its own way instead of trying to be the next lost. It is absolutely worth seeing. A definite rent if not a buy."
B006YZSC3C What a great show this was. My biggest beef is that it was cancelled after 1 season..... WHY? AND on a Cliffhanger!!!!! The powers that be really suck! I absolutely loved this show.I actually mis-spoke earlier. It has not been cancelled, I mis-read the dates of the last episode."
B006YZSC3C It's alright.  I have only seen one episode and it seems to be moving towards a sifi direction and I thought &#34;great, this is going to be cheesy&#34;, but its good enough to watch another episode so we'll see what happens."
B006YZSC3C The basic idea for this plot is somewhat interesting and the acting okay.  Personally, I am weary of women detectives who look like they stepped out of a fashion magazine but who despite their youth and beauty are presented as hard-as-nails veterans.  Just not believable.  Let's get some mature, imperfect women in these roles."
B006Z0OEW4 I've never been a big fan of Marvel Comics. I don't read any of their titles on a regular basis. I enjoy all the movies, but fancy myself more of a DC guy. The Marvel characters I gravitate towards seem to be the anti-heroes and darker ones like Ghost Rider, the Punisher, and Blade.I like all the Blade films and the short-lived TV series. What's not to like about watching a half-vampire / half-human who uses his namesake to eradicate the evil bloodsuckers of the world? Now we get to enjoy an anime version of the vampire hunter's adventures thanks to Marvel and Japan's Madhouse.The \"Blade\" Anime Series includes all 12 episodes on 2 DVDs. The show takes off when Eric Brooks, known in the vampire world as Blade, goes on the hunt for Deacon Frost. Frost is a rare four-fanged fiend that killed Brooks' mother. Blade partners up with several interesting characters in his quest for vengeance. He even runs into Wolverine in one of the episodes.The animation for this show is superb. There's plenty to keep your eyes glued to the screen. The colors are vibrant and the artwork is stylish. Fans of anime will love it and those who don't necessarily enjoy the style will appreciate it for the gory visuals and intelligent storylines.Writer Warren Ellis (Secret Avengers) penned the tale for the series. It's intricate and each episode ties together, forcing you to keep up. It's not a show you can jump into in the middle. Even if one segment stands alone, there's so much occurring in the background that viewers will be lost when it comes to events the characters discuss regularly.The special features included in the collection will thrill fans. There's a 30-minute documentary entitled \"Special Talk Session: Marvel Anime's 'Blade' and 'Wolverine.'\" The director and crew are interviewed about working behind the scenes on the shows. Two featurettes, \"The Marvel Anime Universe: Blade Re-Awakened\" and \"Blade: The Vampire Slayer,\" give viewers a more in-depth look at how the series came to be.The \"Blade\" Anime Series DVD will please comic book and horror fans alike. If you love the character already, this will satisfy you. If you're a vampire fan, get ready for a variety of bloodsucking monsters you've never dreamed of before. There's an abundance of evil beasts we get to see destroyed in different ways. I also wanted to mention this has a fantastic audio mix. You can hear all sorts of great effects and sounds throughout the episodes. This is a must-have for everyone who loves horror films and comics."
B006Z0OEW4 Series is ok, a little drawn out in some of the episodes for me. Could have been done a lot better."
B006Z0OEW4 I sure miss the &#34;Blade&#34; movies. The TV series somewhat filled the void, as did this anime. What I particularly enjoyed about the anime was the character development of Deacon Frost. You almost felt pity for him, unlike the first motion picture, in which Frost came off as a spoiled punk kid made worse by being turned. Great stories, interesting vampires, and an appearance by the Wolverine made this a great entry into the &#34;Blade&#34; canon."
B006Z0OEW4 I have watched both the X-Men series and Iron Man series and I really thought this one was the best of the three. I thought X-Men series had no action at all and should not even been called X-Men series. It was more of them just standing/sitting around and talking about their enemies and who is behind all of this events happening. If they weren't doing that than they would be standing/sitting around and playing mind games with each other. The \"actually fighting\" would last about 30 seconds or so for each show. Not an action pack series at all. Iron Man was much better than X-Men, but not as good as Blade.What makes Blade better than the other two series? It has the right storyline, action, and characters mix all in one. In every show, you will get to see Blade \"actually fighting\" and he is kicking butt at it. He also knows how to fight and talk at the same time. Amazing!The series has rememberable characters and are used well to make a great story. They really try to build up every main character and talked the why they are fighting the vampires. Each one has their own story to tell and each one has a different reason for fighting. Even the main villain story gets told in full to why he is the main villain. I started to really care for each character more and more as I learned more about them more.I love how in this show has Blade doing special deadly sword techniques. He would kill harder and tougher enemies with his special sword techniques. Also, they slowly introduce each sword technique he knows how to do. This was done very well in the series as they didn't rush it all in. I started to think how many does he know? How many are there? Blade starts doing harder more advantage sword technique as his enemies get harder to kill. Well done, I thought.If you were disappointed with Iron Man or X-Men series than you need to watch this show because this one is way better than those two series!"
B006Z0OEW4 This was a very great take on Blade. It explores other vampire legends from other cultures, mainly Asian cultures. This brings a different dimension to what we know of Blade but still remains true. It makes sense that vampires and other creatures come in different flavors and this series takes that in and makes it it's own. Great action and story. This would have been great to see live action."
B006Z0OEW4 Revised April 7, 2012 EPISODES 1-13The action is okay, the animation is pretty good, the effects and sound are good and the music isn't bad but in the end this hero's journey is just too demoralizing.  The story is supposedly about Blade search for vengeance for his mother's death but while Blade has touching farewells with relative strangers, the farewell he had with his mother under similar circumstances was horrible creating an awkward comparison and severely diminishing the resonance of Blade's mission.Blade is depicted as needing to be rescued so often he sometimes becomes a secondary character in the series.  He is stomped emotionally, physically and even literally at crucial moments.  Tough fights?  Great.  Constantly getting beat down when it matters most?  Pass.  Blade has some good points, but the first installments will only be entertaining to those who enjoy watching the hero being crucified and the thirteenth episode will be even more bizarre than it is without them.Hold your holy water and wait for the next story arc."
B006Z48TZS Enjoy the show immensely. Quality of the episodes varies from good to great. Raylin's co-workers are the most entertaining, especially his boss. I do know that not all Kentuckians are &#34;toothless rednecks&#34;, so I understand why many may not be amused, those in the show who are not rednecks are nonetheless pure evil."
B006Z48TZS The writing and plots are little better than average.  If you like watching attractive people and lots of shooting, this show's for you."
B006Z48TZS This is such a compelling series with fine acting and superior story lines that we just can't stop watching the next one!"
B006Z48TZS Wish I knew what I had been missing by not watching this show! I absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW!! You will have your favorite lines & characters you will be hooked!"
B006Z48TZS Raylan Givens is a U S Marshall with a checkered past that fuels his future.  When you dig in and see his life you understand why he decided to uphold the law, oh well, most of the time.  Love the show and its many characters."
B006Z48TZS Protecting their land in the Ky mountains where the coal is along with basic human interaction among people with few possessions and conflicts with the law and big business."
B006Z48TZS This series is always good, and much different from the usual &#34;city law enforcement&#34; sitcoms. Its only fault, that I see, is that the episodes do not end in a conclusion, like in 1 and 2, and you have to see the next episode to follow the story and sometimes I have missed the following episode, thus losing the story."
B006Z48TZS Good bad guys, bad good guys, and the women that keep them motivated.  If you've seen seasons one and two you just need to know that the plot keeps changing and the thrills keep-a-comin' in Harlan County and beyond.Real (?) characters, unreal excitement and more great Elmore Leonard dialog.  Don't blame Raylan, Boyd, Dickie, and the bad guys from Detroit if you miss a couple of installments of America's Most/Next/Top Whatever. You been warned."
B006Z48TZS It's a show about a cop who takes no crap from the bad guys. Good acting makes this a 4-star choice."
B006Z48TZS Justified is an extremely well-written, compelling series featuring many interesting and quirky characters and unpredictable twists and turns.  Timothy Olyphant is excellent, but so are many, many of the supporting actors and actresses."
B006Z48TZS This is a  wonderful show its actors are talented and beliveable...I get involved with the story line and the hour pasts with great hase...keep them coming..."
B006Z48TZS This was a surprisingly great series.  Our hero, Raylen is great.  He just is not the hero type.  He just doesn't do things according to the book.  Please watch and enjoy."
B006Z48TZS We love Justified - we are addicted!  It is so worth it to watch without the commercials - even fast forwarding through them - what a pain - this is the best way to watch this series."
B006Z48TZS Too much unnecessary foul language and gratuitous sexualized scenes and language mars this otherwise excellent series.Love the accents...love the plots.Only nitpick?  The shows depict the drive from Lexington to ANYWHERE ELSE in Kentucky to being maybe a 30 minute drive.  That reduces realism for the natives and bloodliner who've actually lived in places like Harlan County, Breathitt County, Jackson, Frankfort, Louisville, etc."
B006Z48TZS The first season was the best, as it was more based on characters and the parts they played in t
B006Z48TZS Season 2 of Justified was brilliant television and I believe it will come to be remembered as the classic season of Justified. Season 3 works to find its feet after the juggernaut of Season 2.In this episode, we open with Trooper Bergen dead, Quarrels on the run, Limehouse pulling the strings while he makes barbeque, Arlo going crazy, Boyd betrayed by an intimate and on the hook for Devil's murder and Raylan trying to piece it all together and get the bad guys behind bars. Quarrel's wants to go home and escape the mess he made in Kentucky. In pursuit of that goal he has car-jacked a mother and her two sons. Chasing Quarrels while trying to keep the boys alive provides the main action to the episode. The sub-plot involves Boyd and the discovery of Devil's body, information that could only have come from his crew. Who betrayed Boyd?By the end of the episode, Justice has been served to those who deserve it most and our main characters are free to entertain us next season, what happens in between is classic Justified drama, though it all feels just the tiniest bit flat. After the brilliance that was Mags Bennett and the flavor of Appalachia any new villain and plot would fall a bit flat. That said, Justified is still the best set crime show on television and always worth a watch. Most long-term arcs are now tied up so the writers are free to go in an entirely new direction next season and it will be interesting to see where they take this interesting show."
B006Z48TZS I love this show, very addictive, the star Timothy Olyphant is great in this role.  You should definitely watch this show."
B006Z48TZS Awesome show.  you cant wait till the next one is out.  drama, funny, its alittle bit of everything and the cast is great and they act real, not like they are reading scripts"
B006Z48TZS Love this show about to start season 4 hope it's as good as the previous 3 Timothy Olyphant is worth the watch!!!"
B006Z48TZS Consistently good story line. Timothy Olyphant is great as is the supporting cast. Have watched seasons 1-3 so far and would recommend."
B006Z48TZS I was a little disappointed in this season... The plot line was weak and never really found its groove. But still enjoyable to watch"
B006Z48TZS Excellent writing, great characters, interesting plots. Surprise twists, humorous asides and situations. What more can you want? A great series!"
B006Z48TZS Justified is a great story, well-written and the actors are perfect for their roles! Justified is a addictive story about a federal law officer in Miami who was 'punished' by moving back to his home-town area because he had a 'justified' shooting that was unfortunately one shooting too many. Olyphant's character's hometown is in Kentucky - believe it or not the locals are all not all buffoons and inbred hicks (which is unheard of on tv). He is similar to Jack Bauer (from &#34;24&#34;) in that he is strong and confident and can handle almost anything that comes along; and he always does what's right. He is different in that he has an engaging personality and is able to show emotions. He has a modern outlook but he has a firm stance on right and wrong.But the best part is the story lines. Without giving any spoilers away, I can tell you that nothing is easy: an unexpected pregnancy, incarceration, an oxy king and his sometimes terrifying and sometimes hilarious flunkies, a prison break, felonious in-laws,  and more and more. The 'more-and-more part is exceptional writing). This is one series that you don't have to watch from the beginning to keep up, you can start watching here and still know what's going on. Look at the ratings on this - at the time i am writing this, there are 1293 Five-Star reviews and 55 (1 to 3 star) reviews."
B006Z48TZS Rather than getting tired and old, It just keeps getting better and better.  I hope they develop Tim's character more."
B006Z48TZS I enjoy a shows that proves bullies for what they are and then rights those wrongs.  I'm not all that crazy about the violence but it goes along with the story line and that doesn't bother me so much.I really like Timothy Olyphant as an actor too.  I get what he's thinking and while he is telling the story.I wish this series would continue."
B006Z48TZS Entertaining at every turn! Can't stop watching all the episodes. Every season just keeps getting better. Highly recommend Justified to anyone."
B006Z48TZS I never know what the theme will be on Justified every season, but it keeps me engaged with every episode.  I really love the show and I even root for the bad guys sometimes, which is surprising, because I never do.  Each week, I looked forward to seeing it, and would view it multiple times during the course of the week.  This is indeed, one of the top shows on television.  They could never air a series like this on network television.  Good story plots, and first-rate acting."
B006Z48TZS What's not to love about this show?  The characters are sooo interesting; never tire of them and the plots are riveting."
B006Z48TZS Highly entertaining TV show - can't wait to see Season 4.  One of the best written and acted series that I have seen."
B006Z48TZS Good actors & acting ~ lots of shooting & killing which I like ~ makes it more realistic ~ wish it had more sex"
B006Z48TZS I have fallen in love with this series through Amazon Prime, and can not wait to see Season 5. I won't say how many times I've watched each episode, but Justified was my introduction to Timothy Olyphant, and now I am ordering other movies he is in to watch. He is wonderful;  I love the literary references and Boyd's formal language. Buy, or watch through Amazon Prime, every season. I never watch shows with this type of violence, but I love this one because there's so much more there than the violence. I love Raylon's vunerable side, and Timothy is so good at portraying that. It may only be a twitch of a facial muscle, but Tim gets the point across."
B006Z48TZS Walton Goggins is a wonder to behold.  The sad fact that the Big Networks have abandoned Scripted Dramas like this for &#34;Reality&#34; shows how really out of touch they are with good television is all about.  Jeremy Davies is a reassure!"
B006Z48TZS Plenty of snark mixed with loads of action along with a storyline threaded throughout the entire series makes this a must-see."
B006Z48TZS I wasn't sure where Season 3 would go after the &#34;Mags Bennett&#34; story line but I am pleased with the new developments and new situations. Very enjoyable."
B006Z48TZS Third season continues to satisfy with excellent new characters and plots,  feel like Elmore Leonard's hand is in it.Dialog and Setting  - Harlan Co. Ky,  (but really California) make for interesting and compelling change of pace in this Detective Action Cerebral Thriller.  Great new villains an plot twists.  Rayland becomes a vehicle to allow other secondary characters to shine. Boyd is complex but growing in likeability."
B006Z48TZS I have thoroughly enjoyed ever EPISODE for the above reasons, plus the plot holds you in suspense resulting in fun surprises."
B006Z48TZS If you enjoy some good ole backwoods gun play mixed in with some down to earth comedy, and a deputy marshal who enjoys living life on the edge, this is the show for you."
B006Z48TZS If you thought Season Two of \"Justified\" was insanely great, wait till you watch Season Three. By bringing in a \"carpetbagger\" as well as introducing an fiercely independent African-American community out in the boondocks of Harlan County, the series takes an even darker turn.Although the introduction of Robert Quarles, a psychopathic criminal mind who hails from Detroit, played by Neal McDonough (you might recall him from playing the split personality bad guy on Season Five of \"Desperate Housewives\") and of Ellstin Limehouse, a money laundering \"banker\" and BBQ joint proprietor, played by Mykelti Williamson are total scene stealers, one of the regulars is the real breakout star of this season. No longer just Boyd Crowder's wife, Ava (played by Joelle Carter) is a tour de force with some really juicy scenes where she holds her own and more vs. the guys.Plenty of surprises as usual this season and, as usual, pretty much anyone can doublecross or die at almost any time. Lastly, there are extras on each of the three discs. All extras are pretty decent but word of warning: Do not watch the Making Of extra on Disc 1 until you've watched all 13 episodes. I didn't luckily as there are too many spoilers in there."
B006Z48TZS I got introduced to this show when a freind bought me season 1.  Now both my husband and I are hooked!"
B006Z48TZS I watched Season 3 a few weekends ago in a marathon session. I stayed up all night to watch the entire season. It held my attention and made me want to watch more! I love this season of Justified!"
B006Z48TZS just a little too much violence.  hope real people are not like that.  all in all, a good show. about it"
B006Z48TZS i have been viewing this show's all three seasons in one big gulp via my computer with instant viewing.  it has been a great viewing experience.  every season only improves on the one before it.  this is so because the series is superbly written and acted.  as usual, timothy olyphant as the deputy Marshall and Walton Scoggins as his foil are just brilliant.  it would be a huge mistake to lose either one as a character.  However, every other character in this drama is its own mini study in character acting.front and center this time is that the criminal Bennett family, of whom only Dickie survives, supposedly left hidden a huge cache of money.  everyone wants to find this and they assume only dickie knows where it is. dealing with dickie, however, is an exercise in supreme frustration as he usually behaves like the byproduct of too many generations of backwoods inbreeding. his closest friend, with the complete loss of his family, has become Dewey Crowe played by Damon Harriman.  Harriman turns in the comic performance of the year as the most hapless criminal in the universe.  Convinced his kidneys have been cut out to be sold to transplant criminals, he goes on a crime spree to buy back his kidneys, of which he thinks he has four! harriman really is deserving of an emmy for his performance this season.we also experience thugs from outside trying to muscle in on the money in criminal actions in eastern kentucky.  they make the usual mistake, underestimating the locals, who have grown up with shotguns in their hands it seems as soon as they were able to stand and walk. muscling in as an outsider with this clannish set of murderous folk is a course fraught with peril that none of these outside badmen seem able to perceive until it is too late.if you are taken with the theme song, as i was, it is, of all things, bluegrass rap.  the song is LONG HARD TIMES TO COME by Gangstagrass with T.O.N.E Z.i don't want to give too much away here so i will simply conclude by saying this is must see television, deserving of every accolade being heaped upon it."
B006Z48TZS We LOVE this show.  The character development throughout has been fantastic, and eventually the bad guys get what they deserve.  Mostly."
B006Z48TZS I chose this rating because I absolutely live this awesome show I hope thst the next season comes out soon."
B006Z48TZS I watch this with my husband and have to leave the room during the gory and perverse parts. (He has high tolerance, I have very little and get disturbed, sometimes will leave the room) I do admire the acting and dialog, which at times reminds both of us of Deadwood. A kind of tongue in cheek Southern trashy Shakespearean edge to the drama. Especially the Shakespeare plots where everyone dies at the end!"
B006Z48TZS Great show  enjoy the interaction with all the characters up with the times. Funny and witty for all and yet serious also."
B006Z48TZS I love the relationship between Givens and his X-Wife, the writers do a great job of keeping that dramatic and I love how T.O. is cool with the whole baby thing. but I have a feeling that he will freak about it a little later.Plus, that whole back-wood country feeling is great. Neighbors making moonshine and handling the law on their terms, not leaving it up to the lawman to take care of the problem. I love that there is a balance, the Marshells go after you for the big stuff, but the little stuff they are going to waste their time."
B006Z48TZS This is one of the best shows to come around in a long time. Each season gets better with the characters becoming more defined. Hillbilly rules need apply, LOL"
B006Z48TZS With continual excellent writing of scripts, these excellent actors provide one of the best entertaining shows on TV and how they alluded Emmys alludes me!"
B006Z48TZS Upfront, I'll admit I'm no fan of the late Elmore Leonard.  Never liked his books, or for that matter screen adaptions based on them.  I \"love\" Carla Gugino, but hated \"Karen Cisco\" for example.  He's in the same boat as Carl Hiaasen I think, quirky, weird, and largely unreadable (\"Get Shorty\", please!).  I'm a U. Miami grad and lived in South Fla. for 4 years but while I'll agree it's different, it ain't as different as Leonard and Hiaasen see it.That's why \"Justified\" has come as a surprise.  Of course, it has going for it the compelling performance of Timothy Olyphant in the lead as Marshal Raylan Givens.  Olyphant was incredible in \"Deadwood\" and has brought his interpretation of a lawman into the current century with equal aplomb.  When you add in the superb acting of Walton Goggins as nemesis Boyd Crowder you have a winning recipe for one very entertaining program.  Goggin's turn as flawed cop Shane Vendrell in \"The Shield\" remains one of the most impressive performances in a drama you are going to see on the small screen.  This is a program for adults; so that means there is adult language, there is violence but it is not gratuitous nor excessive.  The showrunners pack a ton of story in each episode so you'd best be paying attention.  Supporting cast is excellent and help to balance some of the excess of the leads- truly a collaborative effort.  I don't have cable, but prefer to purchase DVD's of shows that interest me when they come out; we are waiting patiently for Season 4's release so we can enjoy another visit to Harlan County and the world of Raylan Givens as envisioned by Elmore Leonard.  Definitely recommend."
B006Z48TZS Great series.  Well worth the time. My wife has also become a fan of the show. I would recommend it to anyone asking."
B006Z48TZS A great season that opens up some new chapters and closes up a few others. If you are a few you do not want to miss it!!"
B006Z48TZS We really enjoyed this series. My hats off to the writers and actors .... great job.good, good, good , good.Word count?  Stupid."
B006Z48TZS I thought it would be hard to maintain the standard that seasons 1 and 2 had, BUT I am glad to say season 3 was no dissappointment at all. Looking forward to season 4."
B006Z48TZS Love this series, totally wrapped up in the characters and the whole redneck culture.  Love the music too.  Even though there is violence, it is a feel good drama."
B006Z48TZS Enjoyed this series from the start. Good acting. Good characters. Good plot. It sure would be nice to have Season 4 on prime."
B006Z48TZS This is my favorite show of any shows on tv. Love it, love it and oh yes, love it a lot."
B006Z48TZS I am totally hooked on Justified.  Timothy Olyphant is one of the sexiest men on television.  The backwoods drama is very entertaining.  I can hardly wait for next season!"
B006Z48TZS I love the show and its main characters.  It is an adult themed drama and not a family show.  So I would advise not allowing young teens to view it."
B006Z48TZS I enjoy this show I watched it on tv when it was at 9pm now it is at 10pm ugh"
B006Z48TZS Well, I watched season 1 and 2, so I have to see how this story ends. A soap for men. Still no aliens or resurrections and that's good. Prime is the only way to watch a show like this."
B006Z48TZS I have enjoyed every episode of all three years of this show and am happy to own all three seasons. Each episode is extremely well made and continues Mr. Olyphant's Lou Gehrig like record of appearing in only excellent movies and television shows. I have yet to see anything that Mr. Olyphant has appeared in that wasnt superb from \"Hitman\" to \"Crazies\" to the Justified Television Series.Of course this years episodes as well as the two preceeding it come with my highest recommendations. View everyone if there is any way for you to do so."
B006Z48TZS We were really looking forward to this coming out.  Many parts and many great actors and actresses we still enjoyed, but it just lacked the edge and storyline believability that the first 2 seasons had.  Now, we really like that guy who used to shout, \"Fire in the hole.\"  He is an excellent actor.  Tim Olyphant is awesome.  We enjoyed the behind the scenes about his wardrobe.  Some of the actors who play bad guys are just awesome.  The actresses are lacking some believability in their roles like playing the bad shooting girl, dirty money person.  I thought Tim's ex-wife leaving him when she was pregnant was lame, too.  Why?  Weak.  But I will still buy the next season! And it is a good show!"
B006Z48TZS I'm from that area, and it's pretty close to spot on with MANY of the characters! The only thing that screws it up is when you see the outdoor locations which are NOTHING like KY. (i.e. the mountains of CA and the desert-ish locales)  Wish they'd film on location!"
B006Z48TZS I didn't know sony made such good series. Wish season 4 would be released soon.It really is addictive to watch."
B006Z48TZS Excellent show!  There is a lot of action, good characters, the short term and long term plots are great.  Plus Timothy Olyphant in tight jeans and a 10 gallon hat - well, it doesn't get much better!"
B006Z48TZS Just watched my first episode. Timothy Olyphant is a good actor, and his part is gritty, realistic to the genre and the colloquial mannerisms, and the plot of the one episode I saw was engaging.db"
B006Z48TZS Timothy Olyphant just nails it in this show. He just is Raylon Givens. He comes from backwoods Kentucky and you can just feel Appalachia in these characters. He is a US Marshall in the middle of Meth Country. The actor who plays Boyd Crowder also just inhabits his role as does the ones who play Dicky Bennett (really amazIng charcter) and the others who want his mama's money. I am sad that Wynona and Raylon may not make it but I want them to so very much. Thank goodness there is season 4, which I want to make a complaint here and now, you cannot get on Amazon Prime, you have to buy each episode at this time. Come on, Amazon, get it together!"
B006Z48TZS Timothy Olyphant has created a character that continues to entertain episode after episode, the other players are equally talented. You will enjoy this...."
B006Z48TZS \"Justified\" gave us two great seasons, partly because of the excellent work of the evil Bennett clan, especially Mags (Margo Martindale), Dickie (Jeremy Davis), and Coover (Brad William Henke). The two principal actors, Timothy Oliphant and Walton Goggins, are the mainstay of the series, but the Bennett clan was really the topping on the already rich cake.In case you didn't already know, the series is based on Elmore Leonard's work, and Leonard is well known for works which include \"Get Shorty\", \"Hombre\", and \"Jackie Brown\". His prior ventures in TV series include the short lived \"Karen Sisco\" (2003-4) and \"Maximum Bob\" (1998), so \"Justified\" is his first real TV hit. For his work as Executive Producer he received a Peabody in 2011.The series was nominated 5 times for an Emmy and Margo Martindale deservedly won in 2011 as Best Supporting Actress.Although the entire cast is excellent (Nick Searcy, Joelle Carter and Natalie Zea especially), one has to wonder whether \"Justified\" can succeed without the Bennetts. Personally I have my fingers crossed.FWIW - I just saw the opening for the 2013 series and I have to say I am disappointed. There is no real villain yet and the new characters are pretty dull, with the exception of \"Constable Bob\". I'll keep watching for a while longer, but maybe the creative people have just run out of juice."
B006Z48TZS This is one of the best of the shows currently running on TV.  It is the number one &#34;must watch&#34; shows on my schedule right now.  I like the mixture of humor and action each week"
B006Z48TZS This series is great because it has suspense, great plots, and the good guy wins in the end, although he may get beat up pretty bad. Raylin is a tough guy with a good heart, and just wants to do the right thing."
B006Z48TZS As always, the characters of &#34;Justified&#34; keep us coming back, night after night. The fact that we are approaching the final (as far as I know) Season 4 leaves us rather disappointed. This is a GREAT series!"
B006Z48TZS Hope the next season comes to Prime. I enjoyed the quick draw marshal and the complex story line. Oliphant is great."
B006Z48TZS Love the characters and the acting. Great production values, music, editing, etc.  Don't know why this doesn't get more awards."
B006Z48TZS Well written, the actors are great...You believe that the people in the show are real...My only suggestion, I wish that he and his ex wife had stayed together, they were great together....."
B006Z48TZS This is a wonderful show with all the actors giving their all I think. Great show. Waiting for next season!!!"
B006Z48TZS Love following this series - great action and surprises.  Love the characters, the twists and turns with all the interactions between them."
B006Z48TZS Olyphant is a sexy guy. Need I say more?  Ok, I will say, I loved him using his own justice on the bad guys and getting away with it. And I liked his boss, Art not being happy about the justice used, but deep down I think Art appreciated it. They know he always gets his man. Just wish a little more on the bedroom scenes would be shown. Really, a good program.  And its not my usual type."
B006Z48TZS This isn't your typical cowboy shoot em up show. Yes there are violent scenes but  the dialogue is well written and even Rayland's nemesis Boyd has redeeming qualities."
B006Z48TZS Justified rebounded in this 3rd season after a disappointing 2nd season. Hats off to the writers for ending the Raylon/Winona relationship and introducing a group of new villains. This is a well-written and well-acted series. Top notch entertainment. Thank you FX and Amazon."
B006Z48TZS Season 3 followed the first two with more quality programming and plot twists. Always enjoyable to watch. Now watching season 4 and waiting on season 5."
B006Z48TZS A gritty humorous view  of a U.S. Marshal . Olyphant is the Marshal you want to see in the next intriguing episode.. The show is just like potato chips...you can't just watch one .....I would not recommend for younger set as there are adult, drug, and violent situations.."
B006Z48TZS Very entertaining, funny, serious, some violence, some sleaze, not too much filthy talk..there are bedroom scenes, and killings too.Blend of city and country, and a mix of racism in it too.Can't stop watching.Won't pay $1.99 an episode, but will watch free on prime.Can't wait for next season to be released for prime viewing."
B006Z48TZS Again, characters are consistently scripted and perfectly cast (you begin to see them in people you encounter in your own life).  A little more focus on violence, but always &#34;Justified.&#34;"
B006Z48TZS Very little that goes on in Harlan County is above board but at the end of Season Two virtually all the major crime bosses were killed off almost as if the producers didn&#8217;t expect the series to be renewed and were giving their fans resolution. But it&#8217;s back and a whole new set of villains have stepped up to replace the ones who departed. The Blonde Curly-haired Lieutenant from Band of Brothers shows up as a dapper no-nonsense blue-eyed crime boss with a pop-out gun up his sleeve. Raylan is still recovering from his wounds but his cowboy hat and itchy trigger finger are very much in evidence. His childhood buddy Crowder still spouts religion while scheming in and out of prison. This is the South where even the most deadly threats are couched in genteel terms and until the lead starts flying most conversations are conducted in sociable language."
B006Z48TZS I am addicted to this modern day western with the flawed marshal with the Gary Cooper swagger.  The series is very well written and perfectly cast with Timothy Olyphant, my new favorite hunk, as the lead.  I can't sleep without watching at least one episode at night."
B006Z48TZS ...as per seasons 1 & 2, This one is great- deserves watching...gotta say, I think Boyd is a much better character than Raylan. Gotta love that Boyd ! Nobility in the gutter !"
B006Z48TZS Like this series but I will do no more once per week.  I like watching episodes back to back at least two or three at a time.  I do that with any show I watch now.  I tried DVR but I hate commercials so much that even the interruption of fast forwarding  is too irritating for me AND I noticed on another show that they actually cut out part of the show in order to lengthen commercial times now.  I used my sister's sattelite to try the DVR trick.  I have not had cable or sattelite for eight years now.  That is how much I hate commercials.Anyway this show is great and in it I don't think there are any heroes for me the characters are al very well played and they are all vain , evil, and egotistical  to a typical human fault......"
B006Z48TZS Nice show can't wait to see the end I wonder what is going to happen in this series of events"
B006Z48TZS I'd been watching this off and on while multi-tasking and found Season 3 more addictive than ever. When some episodes ended, I would exclaim, &#34;What?! They can't end it there!&#34; And I'd have to start the next episode immediately because I had to know what happened next. The writing, character development and acting continue to be exceptional in a time when many networks seem willing to just slap almost anything together and air it. I am looking forward to watching Season 4, and highly recommend the series."
B006Z48TZS Love, love this series.  Timothy Olyphant continues to excel in his role as Raylan Givens.  Can't wait to see season 4."
B006Z48TZS A great show that keeps getting better.  Wonderful characters.  Dynamic plot.  Excellent pacing.  It's a must see!  You'd be hard pressed to find a better quality show."
B006Z48TZS this is a great show, shows us a different view of how things may work down south.  Love Raylan Gibbons!"
B006Z48TZS It is so addicting.  Can not stop watching.  We will watch 2 or 3 episodes in one night.  Thank you Prime."
B006Z48TZS Really enjoyed watching this show.  It was nice to have the opportunity to watch on Amazon prime after missing the last season when it aired on regular tv."
B006Z48TZS one of the best series i have seen in years. im writing this because i have to. watch from the begining"
B006Z48TZS I'm really hooked on this series.  Interesting how actors that also worked in Deadwood seem to keep showing up.  The only way it could be better for me is to have more episodes per season."
B006Z48TZS There was plenty of action and I was always waiting for the next show. The series was a modern day Cowboy flick and I just wanted more. But as always the producers decided all shows must come to an end, leaving me wanting more of a good thing. I truly enjoyed the series!"
B006Z48TZS Justified just keeps getting better by the season, the characters and situations encountered by our heros (I'm including the other Marshall's) just keeps getting better and better.  Season 3 is a must see, ending in a great fashion.  Introducing new characters that are not just throw away, this is a show built to run.Season 4 is also great, this next year will be season 5."
B006Z48TZS Justified just keeps getting better and better over time.  Usually by the third season things are all too familiar.  No so with Season Three of Justified.Raylan has managed to get himself involved with... wait for this... his ex-wife.  Go figure, eh?  They had something going before and it never really went away.  The tension between the two, both sexual and otherwise, is so thick you could cut it with a pair of shears.Art keeps doing his best to keep Raylan under wraps and out of trouble but Raylan will have none of that.  The supporting cast to this series are easily as good as the main characters."
B006Z48TZS I love this show. I bought it so I can watch it as I do not get the channel. Harlan County could be McDonald county in Missouri as far as I am concerned.Love the guy who played in the old police show, glad he got another series, he plays well as the foil for the sheriff, not quite friend, not wuite enemy.The only thing is where are all the stills?"
B006Z48TZS Im Very happy with my purchase. I am very glad that Amazon has the movie/dvd products to buy or rent."
B006Z48TZS This is a really great show. I can't wait to watch more. There's isn't anything else like it on TV."
B006Z48TZS The writing continued being well done.  Same with the acting.  The chemistry between actors was a little better in this season as well."
B006Z48TZS Timothy Olyphant is awesome.  The way he plays a deputy marshall just makes the show.  All the plots, intrigue, and life altering events happen to him just because.  He handles every situation equally with no prejudice.  Sort of like a mid life crisis gone astray. . ."
B006Z48TZS Can't miss a minute!! Great drama good humor. Raylene US Marshall Bad Ass with a gentle side for bad friends."
B006Z48TZS A bunch of people told me to start watching Justified. I finally conceeded and I am glad I did. It's a great show. I LOVE the main charachter, Raylan and the show is quick, witty, surprising and full of action. Start at Season 1 and enjoy!!!!"
B006Z48TZS This is one of those shows where we get hooked and just HAVE to keep up with this true-to-life gunslinging hero."
B006Z48TZS Since I watcheed the very first episode of JUSTIFIED, I've been fanatical about this show. It's never failed to satisfy, and it just keeps getting smarter. It didn't hurt that Timothy Olyphant, a widely underappreciated actor, was playing Marshal Raylan Givens, who is probably the most unique and entertaining characters on TV since before Hugh Laurie out-lasted his stay as Gregory House. It also didn't hurt that we were getting all these great character actors like Nick Searcy as Art, Natalie Zea as ex-wife Winona, and most especially Walton Goggins as Raylan's best \"frienemy\", Boyd.But where the show really seems to shine is with the casting of its villains. In Season Two, we had the extraordinary Margo Martindale as Mags Bennett, and the terrifically quirky Jeremy Davies as her son Dickie. Now in this season, we have another tremendously underappreciated actor, Neal McDonough as the eerie Robert Quarles and the great Mykelti Williamson as the quiet yet menacing Elstin Limehouse.The season begins in the aftermath of Season Two's finale, with Raylan wounded from not only the beating he got from Dickie, but the bullet he got from another member of the Bennett clan. With Dickie the only surviving member of the Bennett family, he intends to claim his birthright of the over $3 million his mother got from selling out to Black Pike Mining. Unfortunately, after the beating of Givens, and his attempted murder of Ava Crowder, he's in prison. Boyd, Ava's current lover (post Raylan), has sworn vengeance on Dickie and intends to kill him no matter what. Meanwhile Raylan has rekindled things with Winona, and we soon discover she's pregnant with Raylan's child; a relationship and a pregnancy made even more complicated by Raylan's constant run-ins with the Dixie Mafia (represented previously by another terrific character actor Jere Burns as Wynn Duffy until Quarles comes to town in exile from the main business organization in Detroit) and the various schemes and plans of Dickie, the Crowders, and all the other colorful characters that inhabit his world.From the season's very first episode involving a hitman who always gets the drop on his victims to Quarles' entrance as the smooth-talking, creepily charming and lethally efficient \"carpet-bagger\" and his eventual descent into addiction and madness to the endless machinations of Limehouse, as well as Boyd and Dickie in their pursuit of the hidden the $3 million will culminate in something explosive and life-changing (and probably life-ending) for the characters involved, JUSTIFIED keeps on delivering and delivering without fail.Also a very special character is the strangely-lovable Dewey Crowe (played with such incredulity and skill by Damon Herriman), certainly the winner of Harlan County's \"Criminal With The Least Guile\" award.With a crack creative team of talented writers and directors and an ever-expansive pool of great actors, Showrunner Graham Yost has put together the best show on FX right now. It never feels forced or manufactured. The plot points all seem to grow very organically as opposed to a series of chance occurences or deus ex machinas that a lesser show might employ. Despite all of the talent constantly surrounding him, it's a real shame that Olyphant himself hasn't gotten the attention or accolades he deserves. He may get out-shone by some other actors when he's not part of the scene, but when he's together with any one of them, he can match them moment for moment. The success of the show rests solely on how Olyphant's portrayal of Givens continues to be something of greatness, and he's owed more due than he gets.However, that's not to say that the people he's surrounded with aren't great. I'd really like to see Art more personally involved in more episodes, because Searcy's portrayal of him is so keen-eyed. McDonough is currently in the running alongside THE WALKING DEAD's Jon Bernthal for the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor (obviously at this point, it's just a prediction), and it's also a race for Goggins and Williamson as well.Since the finale is next week, and it's already been picked up for a fourth season, I guess those \"long, hard times\" will keep on coming for one of Elmore Leonard's best characters, and I'm beyond thrilled to continue to keep taking that ride alongside him."
B006Z48TZS Each episode draws me deeper into the series.  Every character is well developed; so either like or hate them.  My only regret with Justified is there are only 13 episodes each season; 20 or so would be much better.  The other cable series have 20+ episodes; a hit like Justified should too."
B006Z48TZS Good writing good characters and photography eyes plotline just a really good good show to watch  wish they were more shows like this"
B006Z48TZS Have enjoyed the show up until season 3, and would have mostly likely continued viewing enjoyment but the series is unlocatable on my Amazon video."
B006Z48TZS Timothy Olyphant  and Walton Goggins are mesmerizing, the story lines are action packed and colorful and each week leaves you wanting for more.  Season 3 had a much softer ending;it didn't really end with a bang so much as a &#34;ppfffhhh&#34; but it left you wanting the next season right away."
B006Z48TZS I am always looking for series to binge watch. My criteria include good writing, serious character development (usually all of the characters have &#34;flaws&#34; like the rest of us). Justified goes beyond those with fantastic dialogue (bordering on the poetic), great characters and acting all without taking itself too seriously. (No way so many dead bodies would go without notice in rural Kentucky).It is a series that my husband and I enjoy together. Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins are certain due to remain major actors in the future."
B006Z48TZS I absolutely love this series. I was hooked the first time I watched it. Its' so hard waiting for the next season to come out. I ususually just watch the past seasons over. Timothy Olephant and all the actors are terrific in this show. Highly recommend."
B006Z48TZS This is the best show on TV.  Watch this show.  It has drama, humor, violence, and Natalie Zea.  You will love it."
B006Z48TZS I love all the these characters. They are so much fun. Each storyline is original and fun. I look forward to the next season."
B006Z48TZS I quit watching cop shows years ago. The last one I watched was Hill Street Blue. The reason why I quite watching is they were either to formula based or the character's in the show were to un-likable, or the shows were to unbelievable. This Show is full of likable character's  (good guys and bad) and great stories never before told on television. Everything about this show is very well done"
B006Z48TZS This show is AWESOME. I can't describe it any better.  If I did, you, the reader may think I have a financial interest, but I assure you, I do not."
B006Z48TZS Love it, love it, love it.......Mr Olyphant is Awesome, plays the role, owns the role. Just very good directors, writers and the cast of actors are Awesome!"
B006Z48TZS Justified has a great cast and wonderful writers.  The guest stars are perfect and what's not to like about the Raylan Givens and Boyd Crowder dynamic!"
B006Z48TZS Love Timothy Olyphant.  Hope season 5 is free. YOu never know what is going to happen, but Timothy always makes it out of a bad situation."
B006Z48TZS There's no better program than this one, especially if you are a student of the South and its denizens.  If the South does rise again, we'd better have a Raylan Givens around."
B006Z48TZS I chose to watch season 3 of Justified, because I had missed it during the regular season. I love this show with the humor, drama and story line."
B006Z48TZS when i watched the first episode,Season 1 episode 1 i did so really find it very entertaining.It seams to get better with each season.I did really enjoy this season,(season 3) and am looking forward to more seasons as they become available."
B006Z48TZS Where is the Money?Slippery relationships and bonds have steep price as they swim in a river of drugs, alcohol, and prostitution wanting to score."
B006Z48TZS This series is right up there with the Wire and the Sopranos. Great story lines and terrific character development. You can start here, but I suggest you start at the first season. You will be happy you did."
B006Z48TZS Almost done with season three and still entralled in this well written series.  All of the actors are excellent and so believable.Can't stop watching it."
B006Z48TZS The acting is great; the writing superb with twists and turns that'll keep you guessing.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is the violence, which is way over the top."
B006Z48TZS We are missing Justified.  Hurry back, you are such a terrific story.  We are total fans of Timothy and Walton.  Wish we had an episode to watch every day.  If I were to have a withdrawal  it would be because of not being able to see new episodes"
B006Z48TZS Love the characters especially Boyde.  I love snide comments and the throw away lines are just too funny.  I really enjoy this show."
B006Z48TZS Great writing, incredible acting! While Season 2 was a six star season, with the hilarious, terrifying Bennetts, Season Three brings out the amazing Boyd Crowder, with his epic love story with Ava! The dialogue is worth hearing again and again, since so much wit is packed in. The first time through, you are following the dense and entertaining plot. The second time is gold!"
B006Z48TZS Exceptional acting, as usual. The story line wasn't as engaging as previous seasons. The &#34;menacing&#34; holler aspect didn't come to full bloom for me, he seemed all bark and no bite. Olyphant and Goggins are a delight to watch."
B006Z48TZS Guilty entertainment with good acting, twisted plots, weird characters and dark humor.  Watching the interplay between Boyd Crowder and Raylin Givens is great fun."
B006Z48TZS Justified Season 3 is another action pack year! Just when I think, wow, they have about got all the bad guys, they add new story lines and introduce new characters..It just keeps getting more intense. There is a lot of violence in this show so I wouldn't recommend it for young viewers."
B006Z48TZS OMG, the first episode was awesome! I can't wait to see the rest of the season. I love, the love hate relationship between Raylan and Boyd. When it all boils down, they need each other. (Kane & Able) Hurry up and get well Raylan! Even at his worst, he still bought in the bad guy! Love, love, love, this show!!!!!!"
B006Z48TZS This is the best show on TV. It just keeps getting better and better. The cast is awesome and the storyline is so cool."
B006Z48TZS Enjoyed this season of an excellent series.  If you are interested in watching I strongly suggest starting at season one episode one."
B006Z48TZS The characters in this show are very interesting, the story is full of excitement, and surpring at time too. We love this series!!"
B006Z48TZS I love it, I have seasons 1 and 2 also. This is one of the best series on tv right now."
B006Z48TZS This gritty series just keep me coming back 4 more-even my dog charlies likes watching it with me-I think is for the scratching, etc. but you can never tell!"
B006Z48TZS This season was a bit darker and twisted than the last 2, but as always, excellent writing, casting and acting makes this show shine. Great story lines and character development and Raylan is awesome! Can't wait for Season 4."
B006Z48TZS This show is consistently excellent.  The show is so good that there is a temptation to just run through the episodes non stop. Justified is a gem - what TV can be."
B006Z48TZS It's so good my husband bought the 4th season being we never watched on TV it's great in January the 5th season will air then I will watch on TV. You can not be disappointed with this TV show"
B006Z48TZS Excellent series!  I own all available seasons and I'm watching the current season on TV.  It is engaging, funny, and entertaining all together.  I believe it is worth the money.  I look forward to owning all the seasons."
B006Z48TZS completely hooked on this show. Can't stop watching it. been on a binge for days. Gives you an idea of what goes on in the South."
B006Z48TZS Hey, I'm a small town girl and I'm a sucker for this Raylan Givens character. Yummy. So, he shoots people. I can overlook a few minor flaws in a man. And he's a bit of a rolling stone, but when you get your hands on a cowboy, it's kind of like that - you enjoy what you get while you get it. Oh, yeah, and did I mention the story lines are a great romp through the back woods and seedy underside of law and outlaw. There is no black and white, there are only human beings who are flawed and lovable and despicable. Only about half of America live in shiny penthouses. Many Americans live in little old shacks with big dogs on the porch and shotguns behind the door. This is their story. Their lives might appear small to the casual city-slicker observer, but don't let the hayseed fool you. Small lives can be packed with drama, sex, intrigue and interesting new experiences. Whoever does the casting and costuming for this series is very good. Keep wearin' that same hat Raylan. At least one fan out there loves you in the hat."
B006Z48TZS First ten or fifteen minutes didn't hold my interest and so no reason to continue the agony, I shut it down."
B006Z48TZS Want to sit glued to your chair, watching episode after episode?  Then Season 3 is for you!After a friend recommended Justified, I watched / enjoyed Season 1 - right after it came out on DVD.  So, I started to watch this season, thinking I would just see what I remembered.  Wow - it grabbed me, and I wanted to see each episode, one right after the other."
B006Z48TZS I just love justifed.  I am on season 4. I dont know what I am going to do when it is finished"
B006Z48TZS This season starts out exceptionally violent to the point where I wondered if people in Kentucky just use guns and kill each other including law enforcement. The primary enemy of this season is especially despicable and tiresome onscreen. The pregnant ex-wife of Raylan gets less screen time and Rylan gets to be with an owner of a bar and others while she stays with her sister. Still there are some entertaining episodes and the occasional humor can catch the viewer off guard. One episode is both exceptionally violent yet very well done. One of the stupider criminals in town is conned into thinking his kidneys have been removed and in order to get them back, he must rob as many places as he can to pay the criminal who took them. If he goes to the police, the criminal Staes he will destroy the kidneys. That is one disturbing episode and while well done, I felt was exceptionally sadistic. So far I am finding some things to like about this show but very dis appointed also. It makes me miss Deadwood which I know was violent too but made more sense but could be very poignant also. Justified is a combination of cable show wirh some loosely tied story and a network show where the episodes are more loosely tied together and the theme music opens and closes the show with repetitious regularity. I don't care for broadcast network shows and this aspect of Justified which turns me off so. I expect a little more depth in my shows than a smirking hero with a gun."
B006Z48TZS enjoy it all the way the characters remain episode one after another. Wish I wasn't charged for every one would rather pay a one time fee."
B006Z48TZS This has everything-greed,goodness,back-stabbing,sex,relationships that change,political corruption,drugs and the &#34;man with the hat&#34; is easy on the eyes....I have recommended it to several people, we are waiting for Prime to show the next season--come on Prime, give us a little Christmas gift!!"
B006Z48TZS From Season one we have been enjoying this show.  This is not like any show on TV thank goodness somebody in TV land still has imagination.  LOVE IT!"
B006Z48TZS I started  watching this show and now I am hooked. It's right up there with Breaking Bad. It has just enough redneck humor in it to make the characters believable. Great casting."
B006Z48TZS This used to be be the best written show on television. The characters and situations were authentic to their setting. It showed parts of America that are not usually shown. But in season 3, its fallen off a cliff in terms of quality.All the interesting characters, situations and writing that characterized the first and second seasons are gone. Its turning into a generic 1970s style cop show with a predictable body count every week. Its starting to feel more like the old show McCloud than the old justfied. They spent a whole season moving in a certain direction with Raylan and his boss. Now they have seemingly abandoned every bit of it. The stuff with Boyd has become so messed up that the show has started to poke fun at itself over it. The realism is gone. The authenticity of the setting is gone. The show is just going through the motions lining up a new set of disposable bad guys who will all be dead when they pile up the bodies at the end of the season.Raylan's father was a great character originally. But after Raylan shot him, part of what was there was gone. And when they got rid of his wife last season, all the remaining air kind of went out of the character.They can't even bother to get the details of drugs and drug related crimes right. Its all just generic TV stereotypes now. Maybe they can turn it around. But they are digging themselves a deep hole."
B006Z48TZS While I've yet to review one of the seasons of this show with five stars, I do love watching this show. I find the characters (with one exception, which I'll get to momentarily) to be exciting and dynamic. Winona is the one exception and her storyline this season was the biggest detractor from th
B006Z48TZS This was good.  It got a little stale in the middle then picked up at the end of the season.  I was glad I watched all the way to thru. This is some heart stopping entertainment.  It is not for the squeamish."
B006Z48TZS Really enjoy the characters on Justified. The writing in this show is excellent. We've been watching past seasons throughout our summer...good stuff!"
B006Z48TZS The casting is great. The writing is great. The characters are great. The acting is great. Their voices are all great. Exceptional TV. Exceptional work."
B006Z48TZS Smart, sexy, and action. What more could you ask for? I enjoyed all 3 seasons. Will be glad when the 4th is on prime. It hasplot dialogue, and great characters. Everything, you might not associate with the western series.Weird characters, and intelligent, educated characters get better as the plot thickens."
B006Z48TZS What can you say  - great scripts,great location,great cast - and they keep doing this.Appreciate the effort to bring this type of entertainment to us.  It is obvious that the entirecompany of professionals are  - well, just that professionals.  Thanks"
B006Z48TZS Is a great show and I would highly recommend it to the 'cowboy' or girl in the family.  It mixes the right amount of fun and comedy with serious content.  It has an outlaw element that might not be suited for the younger members."
B006Z48TZS I'm hooked. These backwoods hollers, the characters that have been created, the handsome marshall, it is all good. Can't get enough!"
B006Z48TZS I had missed the first 3 episodes  of season 3 of justified. (in 2012) So I watched them on amazon.com instant video this year (2013). the cost is high though. 2.00 for a hd episode is enough imo. And they make you pay 3.00 for a hd ep instead.  Still I had to go back and watch these eps as I am a fan of this modern western. This show is critically acclaimed and the third season had a great story arc concerning the Dixie mafia trying to take over Harlan country and the hapless Dickie Bennet trying to get his mom's money back. And of course everyone else trying to get it too. The second season arc was all about the Bennet clans efforts to be crime lords so that ties into that series as well.  The third season was probably the best so far, although the fourth is just about as good imo. The picture on the instant video looks outstanding too."
B006Z48TZS FX has some great programming on it but Justified is by far the best show on FX in my opinion.  Timothy Olyphant is great in this.  I was a huge fan of Deadwood and thought he was great in that.  Justified has a lot of action in it and I think the reason is his Deadwood character seems an awful lot like Raylan Givens.  I also like the character Boyd Crowder played by Walter Goggins of The Shield, another FX show that was very good.  I highly recommend you give this show a try."
B006Z48TZS This show benefits from great writing and terrific acting performances. The plot twists just never end and the action is non-stop. Then there are the villains. The show continues to come up with bad guys( and ladies) who are engaging while evil. I strongly recommend this show to all but children as the content is definitely for a mature audience only."
B006Z48TZS Man just when I thought it couldn't get any better, Season 3 proves the plots keep getting thicker, the actors better and better. I am so hooked on this show, I hope it goes on forever."
B006Z48TZS I am super stoked that amazon prime has Justified and other Fx shows that Netflix doesn't have.  Not just season 3 but all the seasons of Justified. Thank you"
B006Z48TZS I have liked Timothy Olyphant ever since seein him as the bad guy in Girl Next Door.He plays US Deputy Marshall, Raylan Givens, formerly working in Miami, FL, he justifiably kills a drug lord. They send him back to Lexington, KY to cool off, I guess\"He gets sent to Harlan, KY lower Eastern KY on the border of West Virginia, which is where he grew up. Think the movie Walking Tall, or Law and Order in Appalachia, on a TV show.Season 1 is him coming back to town, everyone greeting and welcoming back home. He gets to deal with an old friend become criminal, Boyd Crowder (Walter Goggins) and the Crowder Crime family, which deals in part with the Meth trade, that in reality has taken hold a lot of Appalachia. A modern day Western, Hatfield and McCoy style.Season 2 is subperb TV with Emmy winning performances by Mama \"Mags\" Bennett, (Margo Martindale) and Jeremy Davies (Lost's physicist, Daniel Faraday), who plays her son Dickie. The Bennetts are another crime family in Harlan, Raylen's family has history with them, too. There is also a great scene with Raylan's boss Art who gets to catch an old bank robber played by the guy who plays Herschel on the Walking Dead.Season 3 brings in Detroit mobsters, with a story lead by Robert Quarles, played by Neil McDounough, who is planning a pill clinic dispensing business to cash in on all the addicts of the hollers in what has become a desperate land.Coming from living in cities of California all my life, I lived in southern Ohio for a couple of years right over the border from Eastern Kentucky. While I was welcomed with the southern-sounding-to me charm/dialect that is similar to what is depicted in this show, there were some shady things going on in the small town. When I lived there, I was always asked about the pace of the lifestyle back there being \"slow\" for me. And let me tell you, for a California girl, the first two months I was there, I felt frozen in time (it lasted forever, it seemed, and it was summer time, miserably hot and humid). So I must say the writing and acting is subperb. It is very real and believable. I have seen some of these characters depicted on the show. The lines many of the actors say on this show will make you laugh, such as when Raylan's boss calls him the \"Hillbilly Whisperer\"I would say if you are a fan of Breaking Bad, which is ending soon, try this show for your next addiction. Now on to Season 4. I think Timothy Olyphant deserves an award for this show, as he is Raylan Givens."
B006Z48TZS So far this has been a good series something to keep you entertained I look forward to the next series"
B006Z48TZS What a cliffhanger at the end of the season...Ava in jail, Boyd in bed with the Detroit mob. Oh man."
B006Z48TZS Great show.Would like to see more episodes.I highly recommend  watching.You will not be able to stop watching."
B006Z48TZS Justified is one of the best shows ever produced for TV. Great casting, great acting, great directing, great writing, a great viewing experience. It's all built upon great writing and story. Goes to show that you don't need a huge budget with all kinds of special effects and big big name actors to make for very good entertainment. It's violent, but not salaciously so."
B006Z48TZS Producers and writers keep having a great time killing people and making Raylan a modern-day Gary Cooper sheriff who enjoys using his gun.  Perfect bad guys and plenty of temptations for all of the good people."
B006Z48TZS Timothy Oliphant was an excellent choice to play the lead. He's believable and you forget who he is. Justified is a compelling series."
B006Z48TZS Justified does it again; my wife and I have been binge watching Justified and enjoyed Season 3 more than any other; the new villain Mr. Quarles and Limehouse were good additions to the staff"
B006Z48TZS We need more of this type of marshalls in real life. Too bad our society has made our law enforcement officers such targets and tied their hands."
B006Z48TZS Waiting for Season 4 to be on Prime. Love this series. Great Series. Wish there were more like it. for sure"
B006Z48TZS Sadly, Elmore Leonard died this past year along with Tom Clancy and Vince Flynn, three of my favorite authors.Luckily, others are picking up where they stopped...this series is gritty and realistic with very well developed characters and story lines. Timothy Oliphant had been relegated to support roles but now shines in this series.They do not, unlike other popular cable shows, resort to using extremely foul language to satisfy the prurient interests of a (hopefully) very small segment of the viewing audience. I like the HomeLand series but they seem to feel that they need to interject f*** or mother f****r in every scene. Why? It doesn't, for me, enhance the viewing experience or contribute to a story line. The series Sleeper Cell is similar in theme without all the vulgarity."
B006Z48TZS While shoot 'em up westerns like &#34;Gunsmoke&#34; have gone the way of honesty in government, &#34;Justified&#34; brings back their gun fighting style back, albeit in the hills and hollers of Eastern Kentucky instead of the Great Plains. Timothy Olyphant stars as the deadly, stylish and flawed Raylan Givens, a U.S. Marshall who returns to the KY hills where he grew up. There he battles his father, old friends, old foes and his wildly unpredictable ex-wife, played by Natalie Zea. The venal nature of the denizens is sometimes just a bit too much, but the wild and weird nature of criminality will keep you coming back for more."
B006Z48TZS This is an excellent series. i have watched all the series up to the current one now. I love watching tv shows and movies on Amazon Prime - love watching what I want when I want. If you are interested in an action packed series with something exciting going on in every expisode you need to watch these previous series and catch up to the current season"
B006Z48TZS We started watching Justified with the first season and were hooked.  I love all the depth of the characters and the acting is superb! A modern day Western to be sure!"
B006Z48TZS Justified is a highly underrated show, more should give it a go. Don't get me wrong, I'd give it five stars, but after watching season 4, season 3 didn't quite measure up, as season 4 was that good. Still this is a great set and you will find yourself quickly running through the season and ready for the next."
B006Z48TZS As usual the web that is woven is just that spun in a spider web Raylan isn't the spiders but he is definately in trouble not just with his heart either. Why I love this show is because it is real, really! I adore the supporting cast but the writing makes me come back!"
B006Z48TZS The writing, the directing, and most of all, the acting in this show is amazing. I wish I could talk as eloquently as Boyd. What's fun is that everyone seems to understand him even though it's set in the hills of Kentucky where one would expect there to be little or no education. I think Boyd is my favorite character followed by Raylan. Now, there's an actor. With his squinty eyes and facial expressions, he often doesn't have to say a word for you to know what's going on in his head. And, just about everything that does come out of his mouth is riddled with humor or sarcasm. If you get him to smile, he just lights up the room. I love this show and wish it wasn't coming to an end. But, it is what it is."
B006Z48TZS Action packed show! Star,Timothy Olyphant, from HBO's Deadwood, is a US Marshall in Kentucky. He and supporting cast are excellent! If you liked Tim in Deadwood you will love him in &#34;Justified&#34;."
B006Z48TZS Love this entire series. All those revengeful hillbillies are definitely worth watching. Full of action, mystery, surprises, and just plain entertainment. Watch it . You'll love it"
B006Z48TZS To me, Timothy Olyphant just makes the character he plays so believable. I love him and I love his nemesis, Boyd Crowder. Great show!"
B006Z48TZS Season three introduces some truly evil bad guys from the big city and some less than savory local characters.  Outstanding writing with snappy, sarcastic and crisp dialog."
B006Z48TZS Can't wait for the next season! I'm totally hooked on this series. The acting is great, the story-line is great! Can't wait to see more."
B006Z48TZS This season three of Justified was very thrilling every episode was very exciting than previous one - just love watching"
B006Z48TZS Once you watch Justified you are hooked....I am up to season 5, best acting ever, the main character is incredible!!!"
B006Z48TZS Watching with baited breath as they say. I love this guy. He is so laid back and the action is great."
B006Z48TZS I love Timohy Olyphant and love him in this show.  This show just moves at all times and each season is so very interesting.  I will watch these over again."
B006Z48TZS It keeps you wanting to watch more, and it has some good twists. It could hold back a bit on the cursing, b
B006Z48TZS The non-stop action continues in this season and the story is full of twists and turns, as usual. Love it!"
B006Z48TZS I strongly recommend this show to most viewers of age.The show itself is an amazing experience.I just wish this show would continue on and on.The characters have just a distinct personality .. which I've enjoyed,Something crazy good different !"
B006Z48TZS Neither the acting or story lines have lost a step. Highly entertaining and very engrossing. I would highly recommend watching this series."
B006Z48TZS Deputy Marshall Raylan Givens is a totally entertaining character.  Elmore Leonard at his very best.  And the complex relationships are wonderful to watch"
B006Z48TZS I used to love to watch Marshall Matt Dillon get the bad guys and Marshall Raylan gets the bad guys too though he has to deal with a lot of complex issues to do it. All the actors make their parts so believable and poor Raylan never runs out of bad guys to deal with."
B006Z48TZS As the title states, each season gets better.  The introduction of the character Quarle, sets the tone for season 3."
B006Z48TZS Plot and acting get better as the seasons move forward. Bad guys get badder and you can fell the weight of the job wearing on Rayland as he finds and shoots more fugitives."
B006Z48TZS I loved this series and so did my wife. I love purchasing and watching using my Roku. Amazon allows me to keep my movies and music in the cloud at no cost. Easy access from any mobile device."
B006Z48TZS This is a very unusual cowboy show, lots of intrereage with a Marshal who doesn't mind shooting all of the bad guys.  Interesting look at a hopefully unreal area of the USA that everyone sell drugs or make money illegally .  Lots of very good looking young women who all sleep around.  Truly a different kind of show, very entertaiining and looking forward to the next season!  Worth the money so far!  Buy them and you skip ALL THE CRAPPY COMMERCIALS!  It is GREAT! No commercials, only watch a good show..."
B006Z48TZS Every episode is a chance to enjoy a superb performances : bravo to director,show runner & casting agent! Catch up on Season 3 before the launch of 4"
B006Z48TZS Just as season 1 and 2 before, this series just gets better and better. Season 3 continues to excel. Looking forward to future episodes."
B006Z48TZS I never gave it much consideration when it was first released.  Once I started watching it I was amazed at how much I loved the stars and characters in it."
B006Z48TZS Just keeps getting better with each season -- that is the sign of a great show. The character development, story lines -- twist and turns... oh and lest I forget the double crosser double crossing the double crosser. Can't wait for season 4 to be added to Amazon Prime!"
B006Z48TZS A few inconsistent plots b
B006Z48TZS See the previous review, great show, pls include more like this on Prime! Really like it. Rated highly on Fresh Air from NPR which hooked me."
B006Z48TZS I like this show a lot, if you enjoy an interesting storyline with plenty of action, then you will enjoy this show."
B006Z48TZS Much like the action of the first and second season. Some parts are unbelievable but entertaining. The acting is mostly superb. I am starting the 4th season with great anticipation."
B006Z48TZS This is a very entertaining series with a story line that is complex enough to occupy the mind.  Raylan gets away with too many close calls but that is okay, it is entertainment.  Caution though, they will charge you for the final season."
B006Z48TZS This series is a great modernized Western. The story lines keep you guessing. Just when you think it is predictable it turns. I almost stopped watching it after the second episode of season 1 because it felt like it was going to be episode after episode of the same thing, I'm extremely glad I kept watching.For those who have read the Dark Tower series or those that may turn it into a movie (somebody please do that) Timothy Olyphant must be Roland."
B006Z48TZS There's nothing that exceptional about this show, yet the acting is great and there is a lot of fun seeing these familiar faces."
B006Z48TZS Hands down, Justified is the best show running right now. It's not as flashy as Game of Thrones or as award-baity as Mad Men/Breaking Bad, but man, is it good. Tight writing, sharp characters, humor, and action."
B006Z48TZS This is one of the most underrated shows on TV. I have converted quite a few people to this show who now all love it. I did the same thing with Breaking Bad before it blew up and became a culture phenomenon. Hopefully this show will gain more followers who discover it.  While this isn't on the level of breaking bad it is still a very good show."
B006Z48TZS my husband loves this show, he started watching and watched every day until he caught up with the current season"
B006Z48TZS the humor keeps me laughing and gives a feel of deadwood us marshal style. Olyphant and Gogginsplay well off each other."
B006Z48TZS It is not cowboys and Indians it is a country cops and robbers. This is not a game checkers it is Chess. Keeps everything interesting."
B006Z48TZS Another greatFX series. Can't get enoough of it and having it saved in the cloud is my new way to buy. No more kids losing or destroying my discs :). If this series appeals to u then u should check out The Shield and Sons of Anarchy as well."
B006Z48TZS I paused while channel clicking and landed on this series. It is really a good watch, the main character is interesting and the supportive cast is balanced"
B006Z48TZS I continue to love this show. Raylan and the rest of the characters make for a good southern atmosphere. Being from Tennessee ,I really get it."
B006Z48TZS really liked this season better than two and better than four. that said number three was very much the best so far."
B006Z48TZS As with my comments for Justified Season 2, I love this series.  In fact, am addicted to watching it.  The DVDs from Amazon are great quality."
B006Z48TZS we watch at least one episode every night after supper! Always exciting and fun to watch! What are those crazy Kentuckians going to do next!"
B006Z48TZS This is a great series. I am so glad I found it. It is now one of my favorite television shows."
B006Z48TZS Enjoy seeing life in flyover country. All the acting is great. Love Boyd. Keep these type of shows coming to Prime."
B006Z48TZS Truly a masterpiece of writing and acting, coming together in a visual perspective second to none! You will not go wrong watching this series!"
B006Z48TZS A wonderful series. Great acting and the plot lines are very interesting.Love to &#34;hate&#34; some of the leading  characters."
B006Z48TZS Every actor in Justified is excellent. It is amazing to find a series with superb acting even those with bit parts. I am on Season four and when I finish Season five it will be difficult to find a replacement. Timothy is outstanding and I now have a new favorite male actor."
B006Z48TZS Best show next to Breaking Bad. Top acting and engaging characters. Can't wait for Season 4. Walt Goggins must stay on. Is it so bad to like the bad guy as much as the good guy?"
B006Z48TZS I love Justified and the relationship between Boyd and Raylen. I also enjoy the the humor/sarcasm that Raylen is known for. I enjoyed this season because we saw less of winona, she's gone at this point and we lose the whining that goes with women who want to marry cops, dr's, etc but the complain when they  aren't home enough, might be in danger etc. For me, winona always complaining about raylens job was getting very tiresome.  Action, good story line, strong characters.. Nothing but good things about this show."
B006Z48TZS Unending action and he has a county full of great people and ideas of some bad concoction to make money the wrong way"
B006Z48TZS An incredible combination of story, script, cast and production.  I know I'm going to be laughing in a minute, but it won't arrive before a tension filled plot line.  I'm rooting for both good guys/gals and the bad guys/gals.  This is something I don't usually do.  Must be a great show."
B006Z48TZS I'm not usually a crime genre fan, but this one somehow grabbed my attention with its excellent writing, casting, and production values. I can only fault it for not having been actually filmed in Kentucky"
B006Z48TZS The deputy takes too many beat downs for my taste, but he is solid with the side arm which makes up for it I guess."
B006Z48TZS The series is well acted and moves at a good pace. It holds your interest. Olyphant is given some good one liners."
B006Z48TZS I have read a lot of Elmore Leonard. I have watched most of the movies and TV programs based on his works. They work. They work primarily because Leonard's books are entertainments without a lot of superficial adornment. The characters are revealed in the dialogue and don't need a lot of authorial asides and explication. The dialogue and action evoke the landscape.\"Justified\" works. It remains true to Leonard's spirit in both dialogue and action. The landscape provides the necessary mood. The acting is as good as it gets. The music is appropriate and effective. As an entertainment, \"Justified\" excels. It worksAs regards nothing in particular and is only my humble opinion, the actors in \"Justified\" seem to truly enjoy the story and the opportunity to actually play a role on TV that not only requires acting, but rewards it."
B006Z48TZS Left me wanting to see the next episode just to see what would happen. It was a great show and the actors seemed to have it together."
B006Z48TZS This show does not suffer from decline as most tv shows do. This one just keeps getting better and coming up with fresh ideas.  I hope this show keeps going for some time."
B006Z48TZS I love this show and think its worth the invested time. I've been binge watching it even though Netflix is throttling my account. It's worth the blurry screen to watch this show."
B006Z48TZS The story line is getting more interesting BUT way too much unnecessary gore!  Not sue why they feel the need to directly show all that."
B006Z48TZS I am really enjoying this series. I don't like the language as they take the Lord's name in vain frequently. The storyline is very good. I would recommend it if you can overlook the foul language."
B006Z48TZS I like this series very much,  hard to wait for it to begin again.  I watched it twice so far.  picked up things that were passed up befor.  please continue series."
B006Z48TZS I love this show. Like most Elmore Leanord stories the dialogue is brilliant and has a cadence all it's own. The acting in this is top notch. I've watched this show from the first episode and so far have loved every single one."
B006Z48TZS Now I am going to have to watch this series cuz I'm hooked and I have to see what is going to happen to all the characters."
B006Z48TZS Justified continues to be one of my favorite shows.  I think the writing is excellent, the acting is superb, and you seem to just get wrapped up in the storylines.  If you have not watched any of the previous seasons, this is one show you don&#8217;t want to miss.  Olyphant continues to do a great job as Marshal Givens and Goggins seems as if he was born to play Boyd&#8217;s character."
B006Z48TZS Living right out side of Lexington, I can see a lot of uniqueness about the series. Some of is Hollywoodized and the character has some inconsistencies b
B006Z48TZS Another great season for this series.  It was spell binding and really neat to watch some episodes back to back.  Of course, not having the ads were even better.Was looking forward to Season 4; however, Amazon wants to charge for it.  Never have and never will pay for an old series."
B006Z48TZS I am from the south and I should hate the portrayal of my fellow southerners.  But they kind of hit it spot on with a few of our folks. The violence is awful and often and bloody, yet I love this show.  It just works.  Great storylines, amazing acting and best of all they got the accents right.  The third season is a little darker (and that's saying something) than the other two but it's still very good.  I don't know how they got such a great ensemble together but every last actor is amazing.  That doesn't happen often.  Highly recommend it but remember we are not all like the people portrayed in the show down here in the south. Really.  We even wear shoes most days."
B006Z48TZS I don't know where they come up with the story ideas, but this series is terrific.  All the actors are great, especially Raylan and Boyd.  Amazon streaming is terrific and it's great to watch the shows we want on our time."
B006Z48TZS Just as I've written earlier about J1 & 2, this series is well acted with actors not usually seen in movies. However, I recognize a few guests in the plot and I think that makes the story more interesting.  I look forward to Season 5 & 6. Sorry to know there'll be no more story after Season 6."
B006Z48TZS I was hoping to see some complexity to the issues and lifes that intertwine in this series, but was disappointed to see the same ol thing. The writers apparently are not willing to consider that other perspectives would add a &#34;real-life&#34; element and interesting depth to the obvious biases they have bought to the table that have already played out in the first two seasons. I doubt I will continue watching - a real snoozer now."
B006Z48TZS I love this show! Season 3 takes a little bit more of a dark turn, but the great writing and witty dialogue keeps the show likeable."
B006Z48TZS One of the most engaging television series I've ever watched.  As always, great writing; excellent acting and often very funny."
B006Z48TZS Outstanding show to watch.  I Look forward to very episode.  May not reflect the true actions of the U.S. Marshals service but it is just a show after all."
B006Z48TZS Good Leonard material. Good guys with their problems and dumb bad guys with theirs.The banter between Raylan and his co-workers is good, especially between him and his boss, Art Mullen. His dialog with his sheriff peers is also good and flippant most of the time except with Rachael Brooks who provides an anchor of sanity on a job that probably makes a person flippant.Raylan tries to understand the opposite sex and his heart is in the right place, but he just can't quite get there.Mostly good acting and good writing. Moderately violent so you may want to avoid if you don't like a fair number of people being shot by guns.Raylan: &#34;Did you not wake up this morning thinking this was another opportunity to mess up some bad guy's day? I did.&#34;"
B006Z48TZS Very tight from start to finish. I like the transition in how he works people in different situations"
B006Z48TZS Westerns will never die. This is a real western set in the eastern part of the U.S.A. The Timothy Oliphant is flawless. The show is priceless entertainment. I love it. Hope it goes on forever. Elmore Leonard's short story has achieved classic TV proportions."
B006Z8461A it was a typical movie revealing prejudices along the way. an inspiring story for those struggling with an addiction. he finally overcame the odds to be what he wanted to be."
B006Z8461A i thought this was going to be way better but it was a fat guy eating then just loosening the weight but people still hated him because of ruinning a wedding so it was not worth watching"
B006Z8461A I was hoping to find this inspirational health-wise but instead I was bombarded by foul language, particularly the f word over and over.  I was very disappointed, I turned it off."
B006Z8461A Engrossing&#8230;.no pun intended.  Best film I have seen about compulsive overeating.  It is an inspiring docudrama.  I'm from metro NY and love the characters.  So familiar."
B006Z8461A This Independent film/docudrama was a standout at the Sundance Film Festival, also an Official selection.  It definitely deserves this distinction. Co-written and directed by Matthew Bonifacio this lends a newer spin on a problematic behavior.  The topic at hand would be food addiction.  There isn't anything new to this clinically, but in the way it is looked at and handled; which is honest, original, and stirring.Neil (Carmine Famiglietti, also co-wrote) is a rotund man, living at home with his Italian parents and working for his father.  His mother enjoys caring for Neil and feeding him along with worrying about his health at the same time.  He has a sister (Theresa) who is getting ready for her upcoming marriage.  Theresa loves him very much and smothers him also.  Her fiance (Anthony) has his own agenda and is unforgiving with Neil. He goes overboard in the other direction with Neil.  Teases him constantly, finds him 'weak' due to  his weight issue and because Anthony is just an undesirable person.A very influential person in Neil's life is his best friend Sacco. Although he is a using drug abuser he still remains a big part of Neil's family, life, and is his personal confidant.  Neil's life is seen through the New York Italian neighborhoods with their dialect and eateries.  One of the places Neil often frequents (they know him well) is 'Vittorio's Pizzeria' serving up large portions of spaghetti, pizza, pasta, and all of the Italian fare one could wish for.  Neil eats in abundance and turns to food when he isn't necessarily physically hungry.  He uses the food as others may use a drug or another self-medicating substance like alcohol.  There comes a point of emergency when Neil is faced with his extreme weight issue.  Instead of confronting it at this time, he has Sacco smuggling food (his pockets bulging with treats) into his room, as he appears to be following his Dr.'s orders.  Neil's eating is out of control at this time, incorporating the lives of others and hurting himself, his parents and sister.He must make a change. Being so smothered in the familial home that it is suffocating him to move forward.  Consequently he leaves New York City to look for a place in the country, finding one and purchases it.  Neil does not allow his family to know where he has gone, afraid to be swayed back to his old lifestyle and situations.  This decision causes much pain, worry and concern for the family - especially for his mother. He is now living in a vastly wooded area complete with a small lake, in a very small trailer with no heat during the winter.  Neil is forcing himself to separate from those who bulldoze him away from his focusing and is seeing just how rough this is going to be to kick.  At first Sacco is there trying to withdraw from his own demons as it could be a team effort.  Neil becomes personal friends with the seller of the property, many of the rural people, but especially a woman named Lara. She is getting divorced and needs a good friend of her own.  The two of them have many talks, walks, and develop a caring friendship.  She teaches Neil how to fish, even how to ride a bike he had bought at her yard sale.  Eventually, Lara allows this friendship to turn into one intimate episode as she comes to the trailer during one night.  This incident (in it's full conclusion) starting with the that one incident, what it invokes in Neil, and the cruel happenings afterward ends in a horrible backsliding occurrence.  Neil takes his bike into town and orders $48.26 of food purchases at the local 'BBQ Barn', ordering in a sort of autopilot way.  The cashier and the cook are staring cruelly at him in disbelief at the quantity he's buying.  The people in line are making comments, staring, even chuckling. The reaction of the people is overly harsh although real in the showing of the public's intolerance.  This scene is really showing the viewer just how people see this addiction in society, it disgusts them as a whole and is painfully real to view.  There isn't a droplet of empathy for Neil who is in the throes of an extremely painful situation and these onlookers could care less. It was at this part that I was crying for the pain that Neil was going through needlessly  .Neil actually does start out in this film weighing 315 pounds, although the most important issue here is not the actual weight but in the way he handles everything concerning food. The movie is done with much familial humor, emotion and drama. It handles these with a fully developed story that is richly entertaining. The ways that Neil chooses to tackle his issues and his life are brilliantly done.In conclusion, I'll leave you with a quote from Neil to his friend Sacco that shook me to the core:\"No one is ever afraid of a fat guy. I'm non-threatening; no fat guy is gonna take your girlfriend.  I'm a Non-Factor\"..."
B0070TEN7A I really enjoyed this series, but I was also glad that it ended.  Unlike most police mystery dramas, this one did not have an infallible hero.  In fact, many of the characters showed their strengths and faults in a very realistic way that keeps you guessing.  The stories were varied and you have both the mystery of the crime and the police force politics.  It is 5 short seasons, but it comes to a logical end, leaving you quite satisfied.  Highly recommend!"
B0070TEN7A The commander does such unwise actions relative to men that it distracts from the police work. Initially I thought that she was all business at work and above any personal relationships with suspects and colleagues. Her lack of good judgment makes the series annoying. I could not suspend my disbelief and annoyance."
B0070TEN7A Superb acting, great plot.  Watching it for the second time.  I like anything by Lynda LaPlante.  She write about strong women with flaws."
B0070TEN7A We loved watching this. It was edgy and  captivating. We highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Britmysteries."
B0070TEN7A A taut police procedural that goes beyond most series in its fleshing out of the personal lives and complications of the police officers involved. You can see the link to Prime Suspect (same writer) and yet the maturation of the story line. The cases are interesting and though the twists and turns are not completely surprising, they are well written and well acted. Amanda Burton is terrific, worth seeing."
B0070TEN7A I have watched a lot  of BBC mysteries, and for some reason have totally missed this one. I found this on Amazon Prime, and so glad I did...it is really interesting."
B0070TEN7A I had never heard of this series before but usually like the British mystery shows. I enjoyed season 1 and have also watched season 2. Will be continuing with the next ones."
B0070TEN7A Overall this was a very good series. It was very well acted and the investigations were quite interesting. The only thing that gave me pause was the choices the main character made in her personal life. They seemed polar opposite of what someone who had achieved so much in their career would make, partially because the choices had impact on her career. It was a bit unbelievable and took away from my experience in watching the series for me."
B0070TEN7A This American tends to like substance over sex and being too cool for words police detectives get passed over by me. There's all kinds of unnecessary cleavage and 'coolness' in American cop shows so I check out the BBC versions of cop/crime/mystery shows most of the time. The show called Commander wasn't immediately compelling to watch but once I started watching it, it was okay (which is good - not over done). The story line was far fetched with a ranking police woman becoming involved with a killer but they did make it seem possible and believable to me. I ended up liking the season enough to go on to the next one and the next; and I'm glad I did. Amanda Burton is a good actress."
B0070TEN7A This BBC produced police procedural is engrossing and entertaining. The lead character, recently promoted to Commander, is led more by her feelings than her intellect. This causes her to make several mistakes during the course of the series that could cause her to lose her job. The supporting characters are also well-acted and have their own flaws. The crimes are complicated and difficult to solve. This entire three-season series held my interest (sometimes into the wee hours of the morning)."
B0070TEN7A Well done but I do not look forward to endless internal drama struggles but no conclusion to the crime. I don't know if that is going to happen but will know when we finish the second program."
B0070XUDOS Technical shortcomings of picture quality consistent with the production period will distract some viewers immediately.  But for those looking beyond this will find the Chesterton stories interesting.  I would make an analogy to early Twilight Zone episodes - sit any kid down and the first reaction will be about black and white and then about cinematography so &#34;alien&#34; (pardon the pun) to today's experience.  My bottom line:  give one or two episodes a try before you turn your back on this series."
B0070XUDOS Having been a long-time Chesterton fan, and reader of the Fr. Brown mysteries, I was surprised to find this very well done, albeit &#34;old&#34; series. The acting is good. The plots follow the text very closely.... I went back and read &#34;The Hammer of God,&#34; after I watched the program, and quotes are spot on, and so is the visualization of village and the characters in speech and action.Highly recommended."
B0070XUDOS it is a great film version of the famous father Brown books that have been so popular for so long!"
B0070XUDOS This is an alright way to pass an hour with a light comedic character and no great mystery.  I did not find itall that interesting."
B0070XUDOS Young mystery writers learning your craft take note. In fact, take lots of notes. G.K. Chesterton's plots are rich with ideas worthy enough to adopt, coax, pinch and tweak as your own."
B0070XUDOS Kenneth More is well cast in the series.  The screenplays are true to the original Father Brown short stories byG K Chesterton.  Most of the stories are found in The Innocence of Father Brown."
B0070XUDOS I remember reading Father Brown books many years ago. So, loved the prospect of seeing him on TV. The series, being made several years ago, suffers somewhat in technology. But, the plots are there even though they get a bit predictable in the format. Still I love the series and recommend it."
B0070XUDOS By today's standard violent/graphic TV fare- This series is a little bit restrained. That is exactly why I like it! You can watch and have a nice pleasant feeling at the end when Father Brown solves the mysteries. You do not feel upset by violent criminals and &#34;everybody's an FBI agent&#34; or &#34;sleazy lawyer&#34; type of TV.This is great entertainment!! Set in England around1974-75 the stories invole quaint small English villiages and their interesting inhabitants. I recommend highly!"
B007100QP6 My children, both teens, were very excited to watch this movie and both of them were barely able to finish it, and I don't think they would have if it hadn't been for putting down their own money to watch it. The story had promise, even with poor writing, but the differing levels of skills on the acting were at times distracting and at other times annoying. Simple not very believable. Unfortunately, my daughter (13), noticed it on prime this week and she said, &#34;What a complete waste of money.&#34;."
B007100QP6 Just a simple easy &#34;tweener&#34; movie about motivation, young love and tennis.  I enjoyed watching the young tennis players and some of the characters were portrayed in an interesting fashion..."
B007100QP6 This was a good family movie, it was funny and kinda predictable but what family movie isn't acting was okay good enough"
B007100QP6 Great characters, great storyline, all around a great tennis sport movie. It held my attention and had some expected twists and turns, but the outcome was anything but expected. Very enjoyable!"
B007100QP6 Predictable, production values average, acting the same.  Perhaps it is the tennis theme that has the other reviewers so enthused.  I, however, would not recommend this to others: the trajectory of the story line is so stereotypical of many teen movies out there with a lot better talent."
B007100QP6 It was fun to watch anytime you can retro and remember the struggles of teen hood, its enjoyable. Nice teen movie, enjoy it."
B007100QP6 Given the higher than normal rating (4.5 stars) by the watchers, I thought I give this movie a watch, but I'm disappointed to say it was only an average movie at best.  The acting was decent given the very short and unimaginative story, but it was certainly not worth watching before it's theatrical release, which will certainly be short-lived before it gets put out to the Redbox dollar rental kiosks within weeks if not days."
B0071E6J30 I missed most of this series the first time around and have found watching what I missed to be interesting.  I also re-watched previously viewed shows and they were just as good as the first time I saw them.  The series if full of points of interested we have all heard about such as West Point, the White House, the presidential limo called The Beast.  Questions about these topics and more are well answered and presented."
B0071E6J30 This series seems to be a copycat of another series Brad Meltzer's Decoded. No answers are provided, only questions. If you are bored stiff and there is absolutely nothing else on, and you sick drawer has already been arranged twice this week, it's OK to waste time watching this series."
B0071E6J30 Maybe or maybe not there is a book of secrets but it's really cool to watch and to think about after the fact."
B0071E6J30 Interesting enough. Some of this was new to me, some not, but the show is a lot better than most on history channel."
B0071E6J30 Extremely informative and captivating. You get a &#34;glimpse&#34; of what goes on behind the scenes in our government. True or not - I'll leave that up to you?"
B0071E6J30 A great series going beyond the surface to reveal the inner workings of this great country....good and the not so good, but it's still much better than anywhere else!"
B0071E6J30 This show is informative but extremely boring. It seemed to drag.  We did not make it through the first showing."
B0071E6J30 Filter through the shows that MAY interest you, and then, if there is nothing else, watch this. Fort Knox Episode is done well."
B0071E6J30 Very interesting, but got bored easily. Seemed to drag on with each episode. Otherwise it was worth watching. / /"
B0071E6J30 This series was about American icons and important places. I can't figure out why I would care about the Playboy Mansion and Fort Knox in the same series. Did Hugh Hefner pay for the series so he could get some publicity?  Skip the playboy episode."
B0071E6J30 That says it so far...no c ompelling reason to keep watching, just using subsequent episodes to fill in time wasting."
B0071E6J30 I found this episode to be enjoyable and interesting which was showing the inside secrets of the white house. Good show."
B0071E6J30 Start with a subject then add the top conspiracy theorists and you end up with a 'documentary' on Puff the Magic Dragon VS Godzilla. Is the History Channel becoming the next Learning Channel - you know, where 'learning' is discovering Honey Boo Boo? Or how to have a litter of children? Or extreme couponing?  Isn't fact based history important or interesting enough without having to cater to the lowest common denominator and IQ?  If I were the 'Woman Born With 14 Thumbs' (hoping for the next prime time slot on TLC) all would be pointed down on this gobbly-gook!"
B0071E6J30 There is alot of info in this show that really makes you think about the America we live in. Some things you may know, but chances are we know very little before watching these episodes. If you don't want to invest in an entire season, pick an episode that sounds interesting & start from there. I don't think you will be disappointed."
B0071E6J30 Fell asleep watching it. It was rather boring. Don't remember what it was about because it was so boring. Sorry."
B0071E6J30 Another of the History Channel's increasing roster of infotainment programs, \"America's Book of Secrets\" is one that is decidedly hit or miss.  Playing up speculation, myth, and even scandal, the show aims to be somewhat provocative but, more often the not, comes across as a bit silly.  I mean, really, there is an episode about the Playboy Mansion!  I certainly don't have anything against Hef and the girls, but the episode seems ill-fitting at best and completely overblown at worst.  And for a show that promises secrets, many of the episodes offer very little new material (especially if you have a pre-existing interest in and knowledge of the topic).  Instead of straightforward profiles, in most cases the show attempts to sensationalize its subjects.  So we've got myth and speculation, conspiracy theories, and factual specifics all wrapped up in a docuseries that is overflowing with self importance.  If you watch History Channel offerings with frequency, you'll know what I mean.  Even the most mundane declarations are stated in such an overheated way!  It can be off-putting to new viewers, but it's something that has provided much amusement in my life.I'm not trying to discourage anyone from sampling \"America's Book of Secrets\" as it might appeal to those that love the National Treasure films or Dan Brown books or Brad Meltzer's Decoded.  I'm just trying to set appropriate expectations for new viewers of History fare.  The program is fun enough, but it works much better as entertainment (to my mind) than as a source of real information.DVD Specifics:  The set features the ten episodes of Season One plus the Bonus Special that launched the entire enterprise (let's just call it eleven episodes for the sake of ease) spread over 3 discs.  Each show clocks in at around 47 minutes so you're getting roughly 8.5 hours of material including the added bonus show.  The DVD has English and Spanish subtitle options.Episodes:(1) The White House, (2) Free Masons, (3) Fort Knox, (4) Area 51, (5) The Playboy Mansion, (6) Presidential Transports, (7) The FBI, (8) West Point, (9) Black Ops, and (10) The Pentagon.Bonus Episode: The MonumentsIf you are completely unfamiliar with the History series format, I might suggest sampling an episode (they repeat with frequency) before making the full investment.  My guess, this will either really appeal to you or it will really not.  While I enjoyed some of the episodes more than others, the series never really qualified as must-see destination television for me.  KGHarris, 9/12."
B0071E6J30 If you saw National Treasure you will like watching these episodes.  I like to watch educational shows sometimes and this was pretty interesting."
B0071E6J30 I've only watched a few of the episodes and they are interesting and worth watching to know something about them."
B0071E6J30 If you love history, and I do, and especially if you are interested as an American in your own ancestry, this series will be of great interest to you.  I can trace my lineage back to the 1600's from Ireland to the southeastern United States, from the Revolutionary War, to the War of 1812, to the Civil Wart, and then through all the more recent war's.  My lineage reaches back to the Mason's and their female counterparts, the Eastern Star organization as well the Daughters of the American Revolution.  So I love this type of series and can never learn enough about my heritage.  It is also something I can pass down to my future generations; sometimes the personal family history is worth more than inheriting great wealth!  Although both, if available, is always good as well!"
B0071E6J30 And go for a well produced, (It IS the History Channel folks...), but typically &#34;out there&#34;, (with the standard appearances by the usual suspects), as &#34;C.T.'s&#34; get!"
B0071E6J30 I have not finished watching this series but so far it's really quite interesting.  See secrets of the White House and other things not taught in school."
B0071E6J30 The moment you bring in a far right rabid dog and demagogue/fear monger like Alex Jones in as a contributor you destroy all you credibility you once had."
B0071E6J30 Well, I learned some things I never knew before. I found this to be informative as well as interesting and even educational. The episode I enjoyed the most is the one about the pentagon. I never knew that it was like a little city in there with even a Best Buy inside it! I will be watching these again."
B0071E6J30 This is a very informative series about the secrets that are not known about how the government runs America undercover. It takes in the FBI, Fort Knots,  the White House,  etc.  I leaned some interesting information that I did not know.  You will find the series may surprise you."
B0071E6J30 Enjoying this series of programs.  Keep an open mind when watching it.  Some of it will make you really think."
B0071E6J30 Very interesting and entertaining to view.  What amazed me was enjoying a secret, that they were featuring, even though I was really interested in the topic."
B0071E6J30 Excellent show.  Very informative and interesting.  Ready to watch more episodes to learn more about America's Book of Secrets soon"
B0071E6J30 I thought this was an interesting program -- letting you in on the secrets and inside of certain locations, such as the Playboy Mansion, Fort Knox, the FBI.  We haven't gone through all the segments yet, but I am looking forward to the 2nd season, if there is one."
B0071E6J30 It's a bit of a teaser.  Some of the secrets we already know because the programs are a little dated.  Some of the info is really interesting and some is pure conjecture.  I enjoy the historical segments, because basically I am an historian and facts, no matter how old and dusty, are of interest to me.  Many subjects are covered and you could find worse ways to spend your time.  After all any real secrets aren't going to find their way into the public stream no matter how enticing the title!"
B0071E6J30 Many movies have been made regarding some of these &#34;Secrets&#34;.  Having been raised in the DC area it was interesting to me that a lot are based in facts."
B0071E6J30 I wanted to get an inside look at some the things on the show, but it devolved into a conspiracy theory show rather than a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; look.  Three stars for entertainment value."
B0071E6J30 excellent show. I like secrets and this show had many of then.  I will watch this again and again. thanks"
B0071E6J30 The episodes are very informative and interesting, alot of information that is not really common knowledge and/or adds to the allure of the buildings or processes being discussed is provided."
B0071E6J30 Lots of details that I have never heard before. Good entertainment when there's little on cable TV worth watching if you over 65."
B0071E6J30 A lot of conjecture in this, however it was entertaining. Just use your brain and try to separate fact from fictional."
B0071E6J30 Interesting documentary, but I have seen some better documentaries on PBS. I recommend it for viewing if you have never seen PBS"
B0071E6J30 This is one show that seems to get better with every episode, with every season.  Yes, the title is very corny--stupid even--because the show has NOTHING to do with a secret book of secrets.  Instead, the show is a fascinating and intelligent presentation of an array of little-discussed topics.Every topic is well-researched.  Every episode is presented with serious, plausible reasoning.  You WILL learn about some of the most interesting and troubling aspects of American society.  Nobody will present you with wacky theories that cannot be proven or accepted by the average reasonable human being.  You may not be able to agree whole-heartedly with each idea presented, but you will not be able to deny some of the odd truths presented.  Truths we need to be aware of.You WILL be entertained, no matter what you currently believe about each topic.  And some of the show's contributors have written fascinating books themselves, so the show is a nice jumping off point for those of us who like to read and research.The later seasons of this show are much better, by the way.  You might want to browse the episodes produced in them as well, before you buy.Worth buying.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
B0071E6J30 This is typical psuedo-documentary style fluff. There wasn't much information that was well verified or documented. Wish there was more hard facts instead of speculations. History is interesting, speculation is boring."
B0071IDK88 having seen so many of the British period pieces, we were in a search for some of the lesser known works and found this little gem.  we found this to be very good! I cannot imagine having to coexist with the Nazi's day to day in my own hometown!  Many good performances here with some of our favorite British actors.  worth the investment of your time."
B0071IDK88 The only criticism that can be made of Island at War is that there wasn't a second season and that lack leaves several plot lines unresolved. Other than that sad fact, this is a near perfect drama. Island at War opens on the day that the last British Soldier has left the Channel Islands and the Germans are expected at any moment. The Island government struggles with what to do with limited information and the dawning realization that there will be no help from the British mainland. Residents of the island have the choice to leave the island on the last transports making the trip across the English Channel. For those who have already decided to stay, it is a nervous day of business as usual with produce trucks lining the docks waiting to be loaded with the escaping residents.The series opens by concentrating on one family, a long married couple and their two grown daughters. Should they stay or should they go? There is ambivalence within the family and the father goes down to the docks to explore the options just in time to meet the German bombers that attack the docks, later claiming they thought the produce trucks were military. Island at War follows all citizens of the occupation from the displaced Governor of the Island to his son, in disguise and spying for Britain to farm families and to the island's Jews, a few remaining on the Islands in disguise.Enemy at the Door: Series 1deals with the same occupation and period and history and is highly recommended as well but Island at War will appeal to the modern viewer with its great acting and production values. This has become a BBC favorite of mine and even with the unresolved plots I re-watch this every few years. Fans of WWII, period drama, BBC and Masterpiece productions will find this just their cup of tea."
B0071IDK88 I have a son and would definitely protect him from harm. I thought the story interesting given multiple perspectives - enemies."
B0071IDK88 A rather unique perspective the second World War. Rather dry and slow moving. For an American, there is a certain learning curve to appreciating and understanding the British, especially those of some 70 years ago."
B0071IDK88 This is an outstanding series but I'm baffled to have watched the entire season 1 and the first episode of season 2 only to find that the next day, the entire season 2 had disappeared from Amazon. Season 2 will show in an Amazon search but you'll never be taken to where you can watch it so my suggestion is not to even bother watching this series. I called Amazon to ask why they removed an entire season overnight and they said they would look into it. As of this writing, Season 2 still doesn't exist any longer ... only the option to purchase the entire series on DVD. Is this an online 'bait and switch' effort by Amazon? The series is outstanding and I will look elsewhere online to find Season 2. Amazon just went down a peg with me. I hope this isn't a pattern and is just a fluke but the same thing happened with Rubicon. Seasons disappeared within the same 48 hour period.All that having been said, this series really shows what German occupation would have been for the UK and is a 'must see'. I'd suggest you search online and find a site that has the subsequent seasons."
B0071IDK88 When I began watching this series I knew that one season was not going to be enough for me. I am half way through and am entertained, interested, and anxious to find out what happens next. Coping with war, death and living the best way that they can is a lesson in the human spirit."
B0071IDK88 Makes you think about all the 'little' battles during the war that never made the news till the end.Some familiar faces also."
B0071IDK88 Great show, wish it had more episodes, really showed WW11 from another perspective. This is certainly a different view of the war for Americans to see."
B0071IDK88 Island At War represents the best type of series that the British can produce with excellent acting, character development, writing, directing, and production values. I was totally engrossed, but very disappointed that only one season was made. Every storyline was left unresolved. Apparently the series was too expensive to produce, so it was dropped. So I used my imagination to continue the story, did some research on the Channel Islands during World War II, and finished the story in my mind."
B0071IDK88 I am sure that this is close to the truth about what happened in the Channel Islands. Nonetheless, it is not an easy flick to watch and there are not bright moments as in Foyle's War."
B0071IDK88 This series was entertaining to a point.  The altruistic theme was a little too thick and tended to slow the real plot.  The altruistic line always bogs-down the story and seems to always take up so much of the air time the viewer gets bored and wants to leave the show!  Other than that it was worth the time spent to watch!  The theme and plot were well written and acted out.  The amateur-spy aspect played just right as to enhance the historical setting and events.  Conflict was abundant and helped overcome the altruistic bog."
B0071IDK88 so good!! and i am so mad they couldnt make more of them due to the death of the writer. im wondering if there's a project in the works to bring in new talent for another season. just as i was getting into it, poof,,like the war itself, good folks dying too early."
B0071IDK88 I took one star off because this series was abruptly ended after six episodes. Past of this could be due to the fact that at the time of its release in the UK, the market was already saturated with WW II dramas and the series did not get as much critical acclaim as some of the other similar-themed shows Also, the lead writer died, which might have made it difficult for the series to continue. Either way, it's a pity as this is a really well-made film, with a strong ensemble cast.The story is set on the fictitious St. Gregory's Island, which serves as a substitute for the actual British-owned Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. The period is WW II, when German troops invaded the islands and occupied it for the duration of the war, from 1940-1945. In the series, the story focuses on several plots, revolving around three families: the wealthy Dorrs, made up of the island's Senator, James Dorr (James Wilby) and his wife, Felicity (Clare Holman); the middle class Mahy's comprising father Urban (who dies after being in a bombing raid by the Germans), wife Cassie (Saskia Reves) who runs a grocery store, and their two daughters, Angelique (\"Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt) and June (Samantha Robinson); and finally, the blue collar Jonas family made up of police constable Wilf Jonas (Owen Teale), his wife, Kathleen (Julia Ford), and their two young children.The story centers around these three families and their trials and tribulations, and how their lives intersect those of the German occupiers, primarily Baron Heinrich Von Rheingarten (Philip Glenister), the Kommandant in charge of the island; Captain Muller (Daniel Flynn); Oberleutnant Walker (Conor Mullen); Oberleutnant Flach (Andrew Havill); and Airman Bernhardt Tellemann (\"Inspector Lewis'\" Lawrence Fox).The series explores some interesting themes such as what was considered fraternizing with the enemy - young June Mahy, who used to sing at the 50/50 Club pre-war finds that her wartime singing at the now German-controlled pub is frowned upon by the locals, and despite not having any sexual relations with German officers, is considered a Jerry Bag, a derogatory term used to refer to women who consorted with German soldiers. Her sister Angelique, despite her aversion to the Germans, finds herself falling for the handsome German navigator, Bernhardt. The girls' mother, Cassie, hates the Germans and blames them for her husband's death, yet finds she too cannot resist the Germans for too long - getting into a business relationship with the German Harbor Master, Wimmel.Meanwhile, the Dorrs are placed in a precarious position when the Baron commandeers their home for his personal residence and office, and discover to their horror, that their young son Stephen, who was assumed to be away fighting in the British Army, has returned on a spying mission for the British.There's also a lot of sexual tension in this series - the Baron is attracted to Felicity, and Wimmel to Cassie, but the most enigmatic and troubling relationship is between Oberleutnant Walker and a beautiful young woman named Zelda Kay (Louisa Clein). Walker develops an unhealthy obsession with Kay despite her thwarting his repeated advances. The man is a brute yet also lonely and craving company and understanding, but goes about things all wrong. This evolution of this relationship was one of the highlights of the series for me.When the series ends after six episodes, several significant plot lines are left unresolved - what happens to Angelique and Bernhardt's relationship? Will their wartime romance survive after the war? Will Walker give up his passion for Zelda and will Zelda ever get away from him? How about Cassie and June? What becomes of them? None of these are addressed with any degree of satisfaction at the conclusion of episode six. I really wish they'd do a wrap up but the show ended in 2003, so I highly doubt it'll be concluded at this point. Still worth viewing in my opinion, and the ensemble cast delivers compelling performances, well worth one's time."
B0071MUKEG I think this series is very worth watching. All of the actors and actresses do a great job. I would recommend this to others."
B0071MUKEG We really enjoy watching this series, have finished the first season and moved on to the second.Characters are believeable and a couple of excellent actors.Truly love the period dress, story and glimpse into the past."
B0071MUKEG The first session is fast pace in getting most of the characters introduced and a faint story line.  The setting is in the early 1917 or 1918.  However, the ease in which the various lifestyles are portrayed gives it a 21st century flare for &#8220;anything is alright as long as you agree with it.&#8221;  I know that it is just a story.  I personally prefer a good story line that makes one think beyond the scene, and is entertaining at the same time.  Bob's Girl"
B0071MUKEG A bit slow starting but grew into an interesting story.  Interesting to experience the class structure in a different society."
B0071MUKEG I like shows set in that era. It gives you a look at how some people might have lived then. I like the costumes. I like how they show people from different &#34;classes&#34; live and or work in the same place."
B0071MUKEG This is one of those British series with a good story line and excellent actors. There is little bit of everything in the storyline. The time frame is after WWI and all the feelings and aftermath of people's life. Those of us that have been following Dolton Abbey need another DA like &#34;fix&#34;, and this works nicely."
B0071MUKEG A few interesting characters, but nowhere near as interesting as &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs,&#34; or things of that ilk. But it is enjoyable."
B0071MUKEG I've watched this series twice now and enjoyd it greatly each time.  It takes you back to the early 1900's when such things as indoor plumbing and electricity were new.  It takes you back to the days when who your parents were dictated what success you would have in life.  You will find yourself laughing (and crying) with the characters involved.An excellent seledtion for entertainment and a look at early post-World War I England."
B0071MUKEG Another captivating season, The story take place just after the WWI. Two brothers in a life lone conflict with one another. One a very responsible and family man.  The other a wheeler dealer with loose morals."
B0071MUKEG i enjoyed it. Loved the clothes, the settings, most of the people.Watch all the episodes.I would recommend it to others."
B0071MUKEG This was a  super series.  The actors portrayed their characters well, and the plot of the series was captivating.  Some parts still rummage through my mind, and the ending was fantastic!"
B0071MUKEG I have just finished watching the first season and am looking forward to watching the second. Very good acting, like the story line and I care about the characters...especially the staff."
B0071MUKEG I had to hunt for someone to care about in this series.  I like period pieces but if this is what people were like at that time, thank goodness I didn't have to live through it.  What a bunch of self centered dolts."
B0071MUKEG I must say, I'm starting to get a fondness for period drama's. These may be what I refer to as historical fiction. But it still educates me on things about England, that I never learned in school. You begin to care about these characters and start to rally for their success. I would recommend this it is nice show to watch especially if you like Period drama's."
B0071MUKEG Was hooked within the first five minutes.  Well written, very well acted and a good look at the class system after the First World War."
B0071MUKEG Hotel version of the class conflict/drama so skillfully portrayed in &#34;upstairs, downstairs&#34;. Interesting stories and characters throughout. But the tension between two main brothers, spouses isn't sold very convincingly. My wife and I look at each other after a dramatic encounter and say, &#34;did something happen with those two, or did they order room service and get heartburn?&#34;  Even so, series holds potential worth waiting for"
B0071MUKEG This show is highly addictive. You get involved in the rich story lines and you will fall in love with the cast."
B0071MUKEG A great British show made in the 90s. Stephen Moyer (Vampire Bill in True Blood) plays one of the characters in the first season. The show has some great story lines and I was so surprised that Russell T Davies wrote most of the episodes since he's better known for Dr Who and Torchwood."
B0071MUKEG We had such high hopes for the series, it became clear after a point that the writing like a lifetime movie. Some scandal and a few interesting situations but most of it lifetime movie. The actors can only do so much with the bad script,a few of the main characters are so self-sacrificing that it a bore. Still not sure what happen tot he grandmother. Watched many British series I recommend London Hospital, Downton Abby, Call the Midwife, He knew he was right, Upstairs Downstairs (1970's version) better written much more entertaining."
B0071MUKEG Very entertaining. Enjoyed the series and was sorry when it was over. Nicely done. Most people who like period drama will enjoy this one."
B0071MUKEG This series is ancient but I thoroughly loved the acting. Characters are very well fleshed out. The story to me is just as interesting as Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs, though obviously dated. Some pretty wild stuff goes on."
B0071MUKEG Even though this two season series was made in 1997 and 1998, it has a lot of similarities to Downton Abbey. I've been very impressed with the acting and plot line. It takes place in a hotel instead of a mansion, but the relationships between the servants and the high society folk is oh so similar. If you like Downton, you will love this. I was surprised."
B0071MUKEG I liked the series very much.  wish there were more  chapters.  there wasn't anything I didn't like about it.  most of the people I had'nt  seen before, which made me enjoy it more,are there more of these kinds of show???"
B0071MUKEG this is a grand series and you just know the dastardly brother is going to have his way.... you can't believe his wife is actually his wife, the characters all play out very nicely against each other and the duality of the life of the servants and the lives of the hotel owners is fantastic"
B0071UYJFE Suspension of disbelief is the key with a speculative drama like Touch and I'm generally pretty easy, but more and more often I find myself jarred out of the narrative by bad writing, bad acting or just plain ridiculousness of premise. Yet at the same time I don't stop watching either. The viewer is supposed to believe that a savant boy (or as it develops a group of savant children who turn out to be the 32 righteous people God keeps the world going for) are supposed to save the world; I suppose it saves us the trouble of taking responsibility putting it off on especially vulnerable children like that. Jake, the boy in question, communicates through numbers, and his father finally figures out how and follows the numbers every week to solve a personal problem for people connected in the six degrees of separation. If Keefer Sutherland has to bring import to the line \"Jake is trying to tell me something!\" one more time I think he should petition SAG for bad working conditions. I'm sure he feels the same based on his line delivery.We are also supposed to believe that children's services in New York State are filled with mid-town real estate of empty playrooms and new toys and caseworkers who spend an entire afternoon taking one client to the park. Yes, it turns out that an evil corporation wants the boy for his abilities with the Fibonacci sequence and the ability of the dodecahedron to kill, but the caseworkers are supposed to be legit and acting as unknowing puppets for the evil corporation. Each week the larger arc is added to, with varying degrees of success and one or more smaller mysteries are solved with Jake's numbers and the six degrees game. The formula is getting a bit stale though and not enough believable information is being added to the larger storyarc of why a mathematic savant, or even several of them, have more than the obvious corporate value. I do keep watching, but partly to see how the writers are going to punch their way out of the corner they are in. I know the tone of this review has been a bit sarcastic, and I am actually sorry to report my findings. I like scripted dramas and even more I like dramas in the speculative or science fiction category. I really am reluctant to report this as math, mysticism and a mixed bag."
B0071UYJFE In 2012 we should have expected this kind of story. . . one that shows us that we are connected in so many odd and wonderful ways. Sutherland is definitely not reprising his persona on 24. He shows much more vulnerability to the issues of his unusual son who doesn't speak. Both father and son Jake find ways to communicate while solving connection glitches between seemingly unrelated people. It looks like we're in for another season since Touch was renewed. This is a fresh approach that makes for great TV."
B0071UYJFE i for one am glad to see kiefer sutherland in a role which doesn't involve horrific world events with massive explosions and destruction.  this time out he is in a much more hopeful series where he plays a father of a gifted child who has been mistakenly diagnosed as autistic.  he instead has a special ability to communicate through complex math patterns.  in this episode, kiefer, the widowed father, a social worker, and a studier of this gift (danny glover) begin working out the true nature of the boy's living experience.the boy actor is quite good.  he narrates the series but does not speak dialogue.  kiefer sutherland, in a recent interview, said that the boy actor was the first boy whom they tested with him in a scene.  thereafter, they tested him with all these other boys until he protested, saying, \"hey, just bring back the first kid.  he was perfect.\"  i agree.  a mistake on casting with the boy would have been an utter disaster for this show.there is a summary review on this item's product page that is excellent, written by another Amazon reviewer. it gives all the plot details and actors' names.  i suggest you read it next if you want further detail.  give this show a try.  only the pilot aired in january so that has to hold you until march, when it begins as series tv."
B0071UYJFE This show is great and is a real attention getter, into a realm not often visited. The only thing I don't care for is the social services woman. Her whole demeanor is contrived and and the condescending manner in which she treats Jake even after he has shown his outstanding abilities is horribly irritating. Maybe she cleans up her act. I have only watched two episodes from the 1st season."
B0071UYJFE I watched all episodes of touch. Couldn't wait until the next week got here so I could see another episode. Each week the plot got better and Kiefers son was in more and more danger. I suggest you watch Touch from beginning to end."
B0071UYJFE I loved &#34;Heroes&#34; so I thought &#34;Touch&#34; would continue this writer's success.  However, while it does have some attractive carryovers from Heroes -- most notably realistic-seeming foreign locales and (subtitled) dialogue, it verges on self-parody right out of the gate.  The excellent Kiefer Sutherland has to work really hard with a woefully underwritten part and can't get the character to be believable.  Too many scenes of his following his autistic kid and yelling: &#34;Jake, Jake, don't go there!  Jake. Jakle, come back!  Jake, Jake, be careful!&#34; led me to stop watching after the third episode."
B0071UYJFE My grandson and I have watched this several times over. We are fascinated with the premise and the whole Fibonacci Sequence, etc, and I rather enjoyed Kiefer Sunderland in this show. Why it did not continue into Season 2 is beyond me, I certainly thought it well worth continuing, thought there was plenty of story line left to go and room for growth for the characters. It left the end of Season 1 kind of hanging, and that there was not an &#34;end&#34;, was a bit disappointing, but as far as it goes, this was a good show and I found it enjoyable."
B0071UYJFE To be honest, I wasn't holding out a lot of hope on \"Touch\" being great, but boy, was I wrong.  First, it seemed to revolve around a very young boy, so I didn't think it would have much appeal from an adult standpoint.  Second, I didn't know Tim Kring, creator of the \"Heroes\" TV series, was involved.  The fact that Kiefer Sutherland and Danny Glover were part of the cast, I suppose, was the main attraction that got me watching.  Titus Welliver is another cast member who figures prominently in the pilot.In the pilot, the aforementioned boy has never spoken a word in his life and doesn't like to touch people or be touched by them.  Kiefer Sutherland plays his father, a former journalist who has trouble holding down a job because he constantly has to respond when his son climbs high structures such as radio towers.  When we first meet him, he is working at the airport as a baggage handler.The premise of the show is based on a Chinese saying/belief that certain people are connected by an invisible string that can never be broken.  The boy, in essence, knows this in his own way and can predict that certain things will happen or that certain things are significant. He has an obsession with cellular phones and frequently scribbles patterns, pictures and numbers in a notebook or on a piece of paper.Like Kring's \"Heroes\" and this pilot's characters, \"Touch\" has an international, convoluted, connecting thread running through it, with a host of characters from Japan, the USA, the Middle East, and then some.  While I loved \"Heroes,\" I did feel that it rode off the rails a bit too often.  Let's hope that \"Touch\" races along without losing us or itself on the way.Highly recommended."
B0071UYJFE I was trying to figure out why I don't engage with this show - I enjoyed (some of) Tim Cring's Heroes series and Touch follows a similar theme of extraordinary results from an everyday hero. I also liked the pilot but by the fourth episode had completely lost interest. I'll also confess that I'm not a fan of the 'network narrative' genre where Hollywood can manufacture a story line based upon on the coincidental eventual meeting point of a handful of strangers.I think there are a couple of problems. The first is the mathematical theme - it just doesn't make sense to extrapolate a Math 101 understanding of the Fibbonaci sequence and the Butterfly Effect to give a mute child near psychic powers to predict where the lives of a random bunch of strangers will meet. It comes across as really manipulative and far-fetched. The second is that Keifer has little to do other than act like Lassie's owner, trying to make sense of cryptic messages from a child that won't speak, while filling the dialog gap with cries of \"Jake! Jake! Jake!\" every other scene.So Touch is a sentimental show more along the lines of Highway to Heaven (whoa, dig out the history books) than anything particularly scientific as it pretends to be. And after four episodes the plot didn't move forward enough to really capture my attention."
B0071UYJFE By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiMartin Bohm (Kiefer Sutherland) is a former reporter living in New York City. He lost his wife,  in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.He had to find a less demanding job because his 11-year-old son, Jake is mute and emotionally disturbed. He has been moving from job to job trying to make enough to keep the plates spinning. It's a hard task considering his wife was a stockbroker.For the third time he's called to a cell tower where Jake has climbed. He's set off the alarm all three times at 3:18. The firefighters who respond, warn Martin they'll have to let child services know.Jake doesn't speak but is bewitched by numbers. He especially loves cell phones so Martin collects and brings home lost cell phones, which haven't been claimed where he works as a baggage handler at the airport.Jake takes the cell phones and somehow makes them ring at the same time and display the same incoming number.He does this during the time social worker Clea Hopkins (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is visiting. She chalks Martin up to being crazy and arranges to keep Jake for evaluation.Martin, desperate not to lose Jake, begins to think this obsession with numbers is meant to be.His search leads him to Professor Arthur Teller (Danny Glover) who says he's seen this before. He convinces Martin that Jake is trying to warn him of something important.Touch is a great sci-fi drama, that never could have been pulled off as believeable without Kiefer's knockout performance."
B0071UYJFE Kiefer Southerland returns to television in TOUCH, a Fox original drama about a 9/11 widower attempting to raise his emotionally disconnected 11-year-old son.  Southerland plays Martin Bohm, whose wife died in the Twin Towers.  His son Jake (David Mazouz) seems to be autistic - he doesn't speak (although he does provide occasional narration), he inexplicably climbs cell towers, and he can't stand to be touched.  But what's really interesting about Jake is his propensity for mathematical patterns, which he sees everywhere in the world around him.  In those patterns, Jake makes connections that are ultimately extraordinary.The theme of TOUCH is that we are all connected in inexplicable ways.  A man in Ireland takes a cell phone video of co-worker Kayla Graham performing in a local club.  He tells Kayla she's going to end up a superstar, and then he slips the cell phone into a random backpack.  By the end of the episode, that cell phone video is projected on a massive Times Square-style screen in Tokyo - superstardom, indeed!This is just a small example of the often miraculous interconnections revealed in this episode.  Jake is obsessed with numbers on busses, lottery tickets, cell phones, newspapers, and calendars, using them as road maps to people and events that can be life-changing.  One such chain of numbers connects the firefighter who tried to save Martin's wife back on 9/11 with a winning lottery ticket and a bus filled with school children.  These are global connections that are overwhelming in scope.TOUCH also features Danny Glover as odd-but-brilliant mathematician Arthur Teller, who tries to explain to Martin how Jake is using something called the Fibonacci sequence to reveal the world's interconnected patterns.  And Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays social worker Clea Hopkins, who doesn't believe Martin is capable of taking care of Jake - that is, until she begins to suspect that Jake's deductive powers truly are miraculous.Overall, TOUCH is a unique and engaging drama that has great potential.  It was written and directed by Tim Kring, of HEROES fame, and produced by the same bunch that gave us TERRA NOVA.  I found the pilot to be complex and intriguing - this is a show you'll need to pay careful attention to, as characters and events become quickly interwoven in ways that could become confusing.  It's also a show with a lot of heart - there's one particular sequence where a grieving father experiences unexpected grace in a very unexpected way.  This is an emotionally gripping show that knows the difference between sentiment and sentimentality.  You might find yourself tearing up as you watch TOUCH, but you will never feel manipulated.  I highly recommend it - there's nothing else like it on TV today.The show will begin showing new episodes in mid-March, 2012."
B0071UYJFE Love the integration of numerology, Jewish culture, international plot-lines, synchronicity, and business culture that is feature in this series.  So often we find thrillers and suspense drama that is gruesome, sad, leaving  us bereft of any redeeming message.  I love this series because ultimately it focuses on the significance of connections between people, cultures, events.  It has a spectacular message, even if it pushes the envelope of believability at times when it comes to coincidence and destiny.  The shoe presents semi-autistic, differently abled and bright children in a way that causes us to reflect upon how we understand their value and people's value in general.  It challenges assumptions we make about people based on their communication styles.  Keifer Sutherland gives a compelling performance as usual though his connection to Jake as a father rings a bit inauthentic at points."
B0071UYJFE \"Touch\" has characteristics of a well-crafted TV drama; namely, well-developed characters and a premise which is unique and initially engaging. However, once all the components of the story are assembled, the result is dull and contrived. Ultimately, everything will work out because the numbers say so. That's about it. So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get-go. The numbers are little more than an omnipotent deus ex machina, and there's no real mystery, wonder, or drama to the plot resolutions they achieve. All this makes for a boring and saccharine hour of television that really isn't worth investing in."
B0071UYJFE This is an enjoyable show, with a bit of cheesiness, but you can overlook the cheese, and enjoy the touch."
B0071UYJFE His faith in his son's abilities is touching. He's a broken man who loves his son enough to risk it all. The numbers are really interesting. Knowing children with autism, its fascinating to take the unusual talents they have another step further - almost into a spiritual realm."
B0071UYJFE Of course, seeing Kiefer Sutherland on the small screen is a treat all in itself, but I still wondered if this series was going to live up to its reputation. I'm happy to say that it did. Martin (Kiefer) is a single dad with a son who has some serious emotional issues. This alone is enough to add elements of heart touching drama. Their relationship is touching and realistic and you'll find yourself routing for them to work out the issues in their path. Jake, his son, also has a surprising secret that adds a whole new level of excitement to the series. He can see the future. This would be overwhelming for an adult, so you can imagine the trials it creates for an eleven year old boy. In each episode they are faced with the struggle of deciding whether to intervene or let fate play out. Of course, there is lots of intervening which is where the action comes in. In my opinion, this is one of the best series to emerge in 2012 because it combines my two favorite elements--drama and the supernatur"
B0071UYJFE The ACTING is very good and the characters unusual and interesting. The PLOTS and characters are interwoven in intriguing ways. Connections are made through mystic numbers supplied by an autistic child. Fresh and well done series that I highly recommend."
B0071UYJFE I bought the entire season of Touch and loved each interesting aspect of the series!  My video was a good stream, and the stories were excellent.  I would recommend Touch to anybody."
B0071ZTQCU Here's my trying to give pub to GP506 (a.k.a. Guard Post 506), a macabre South Korean ghost story from 2008 that shares commonality with The Exorcist and with Ridley Scott's Alien in that they all roll with the slow burn approach. You have to be patient. The scares come measured and manifest more from the psychological mind-diddling the story lays on the viewer. So, yeah, GP506 will suit ya if you're the contemplative sort or if your lazy ass can't find the remote.Guard Post 506 is a support base that overlooks the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. It's a tour of duty that lasts three months, during which time no one is allowed to leave. When GP506 fails to report in, a squad of military police deploys to investigate. The soldiers arrive to a near abandoned post, soaked with blood and viscera and strewn with mutilated cadavers and gruesome errant body parts. Quickly move that flashlight over there and there's an alarming glimpse of the lone survivor, Corporal Kang (Lee Yeong-hoon), leering from the dark, holding a bloodied axe. Kang is forcibly detained but falls into a coma. So much for questioning him.Sgt. Major Noh Seong-gyu (Chun Ho-jin) is the calm investigative officer whose marching orders come with a caveat. He has only this one night to get to the truth behind the mass killings before the cover-up begins, and not much to work with: disturbing diary entries, a perplexing camcorder message, and one more unearthed soldier, Yoo (Jo Hyeon-jae), who at last confides to the Sgt. Major the terrible events that befell his platoon.GP506 revels in a plot device that I'm really partial to: People who are cut off from the outside world and must now cooperate and face an unknown, terrifying threat even as they gradually lose their sh--. It's a plot device well executed in films like Assault on Precinct 13, John Carpenter's The Thing, and the aforementioned Ridley Scott's Alien. GP506 ratchets up the psychological horror. We're made privy to many scenes that reveal the soldier's psyche and are informed of the constant pressure that weigh them down.Never mind that every few minutes, some panicky sentry runs in to report yet another disquieting event, and that this inadvertently assumes a running gag element. Director Su-chang Kong clamps down with the claustrophobic atmosphere. There's an abundance of spooky corridors and dimly lit bunkers, these making the ideal stage for Kong's striking visual shocks. His payoffs are rewarding.It's not without its faults. It goes on for too long, and too many viewers will interpret the slow burn approach to scenes that friggin' drag. The early stages present an ambiguous tone; it takes a minute for you to catch up. The film relies on faulty narrative structure, specifically on a series of frustrating flashbacks. Kong screws the p00ch by failing to give ample visual clues to separate the past from the present. The transitions come abrupt and unannounced. You have to work to tell people apart, seeing as how everyone's in uniform, and that several characters feature in both time frames, and that most of the soldiers are simply faces in the crowd. And to add to the confusion, both time frames play out to a parallel plotline. All we know is that, with Sgt. Major Noh's squad, the horror is starting anew.So, yeah, it's a thinking person's horror flick, not that the gorehounds are excluded. The director splatters a few extremely brutal scenes along the way. Chun Ho-jin (\"Sgt. Major Noh\") and Lee Yeong-hoon (\"Cpl. Kang\") are the two stand-outs. GP506 is in need of a major tweak or three, but it's one of those movies I'm glad I watched. If you're hankering for foreign cinema that steep you in unfamiliar culture and a different style of filmmaking, then you could do worse than with this one."
B0071ZTQCU A group of soldiers enter GP 506, eventually finding a bloody mess and a corpse... and an axe-wielding man drenched in blood. Sergeant Major Seong-gyu Noh is sent to investigate the events. The Guard Post is a creepy mystery film with a great setting, held back by confusing storytelling.The story is interesting; as a mystery film, it tackles all possibilities from psychopathic to supernatural, and everything in between. There are unexpected twists and turns at every corner to keep you guessing. It all leads up to a tense, well-done ending. The setting is great; an isolated guard post with dark, tight corridors. However, the story is negatively affected by the confusing storytelling. The current events are told concurrently with the past through flashbacks; this can work, but, in this case, the editing isn't smooth and tight enough to keep the audience on track; I think there was even a flashback within a flashback at one point. The point is: you may get lost during this film. Another slightly less negative flaw is the inflated runtime; it often feels empty and uneventful because it is too long. The acting is great, the cinematography is amazing, and I also enjoyed the music (some of it gave off an \"Old Boy\" vibe).Overall, The Guard Post is a good mystery film. Although it has great acting, cinematography, and music, the film is ultimately held back by its poor storytelling/editing and an inflated runtime. As of 3/11/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a rental is recommend for fans of the genre.Looking for other similar South Korean films? Try out \"R-Point\".The Guard Post has strong violence and gore."
B0071ZTQCU I usually like Asian horror movies because they tend to have more suspense and less gore than American films. Unfortunately, the guardpost came up short on suspense.The first 45 mins or so were good since the film kept you guessing as to what the real issue was - ghosts, demons, virus, or just crazy soldiers. Once you find out what is causing the deaths, the best part is over. But unfortunately, the movie isn't. At about 2 hrs, there was just too much of the same stuff at the end. I knew how the film would end before it happened, though I was surprised at what took place with a few of the characters.This movie is great if you like long, drawn out conversations and don't mind getting confused with all of the flashbacks. There is some drama and a few scenes make you gasp, but there are not enough of them to make it worth spending 2hrs on this film. Fortunately, the movie was free with my Prime membership so I wasn't too upset."
B0071ZTQCU This is a well-made Korean horror movie that had lots of potential but it doesn't know when to quit. The idea behind it isn't bad, the setting is great. But it loses all its punch because of an ending that seemingly goes on forever."
B0071ZTQCU Really good movie, it was a lot better than I expected.  The acting was good and the script was good.  It wasn't a super horror movie like in a ghost story or something, but it kept you on the edge of your seat.  Honor and Ethics played a part in the film, and I really enjoyed it."
B0072281NC After the Great War, out of work Captain, Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) accidentally comes across his lifelong friend and pal Prudence \"Tuppence\" Cowley (Francesca Annis). Tuppence is also out of work. Over their sparse meal they speculate on doing any job of anybody for outrageous fees.This speculative talk was overheard and the wheels are set in motion when Tuppence is given the opportunity and gives what she thinks is a false name. This sets off a series of events that employs them to find a missing girl and the identity of a mysterious Mr. Brown.Made for TV and fairly transparent, this film still has all the ambiance of a BBC Agatha Christy production.  It is a period piece and employs many major English actors. One actor you can recognize right off is Honor Blackman who played Pussy_Galore in \"Goldfinger\" (1964)."
B0072281NC Tommy and Tuppence are exactly like the characters portrayed in Agatha Christie's Book. Francessci Annis is too cute as Tuppence, (we are younger) however, my husband has become 'mad' about her! Great fun, charming!"
B0072281NC What's not to like. This must have been written on one of her vacations because it is entertaining but involves more dialogue than one may like. Usually she has a large cast of characters but these episodes seem to skate by with a lot of chit chat. Good for a rainy night."
B0072281NC Francesca Annis especially was simply the wrong choice to play Tuppence. She looks more than 40 years old, rather than a young 20-something woman. Her partner, whose name I can't remember at the moment, was also too old. It made the shows leaden and ridiculous rather than light and fun."
B0072281NC Tommy and Tuppence really are a dynamic duo when it comes to solving or preventing a crime.  Recommended for the whole family"
B0072C8ME0 The quote above is sang by Tim to the son he took from the Used Toilet Paper store owner. Yeah, the movie is extremely bizarre. Tim & Eric spent $1 Billion to make a 3 minute movie and have to make that money back by reopening a destroyed mall, or else. Right off the bat, most people will either love this movie or hate it. I was stuck in the middle.First of all, be warned that this movie is very disgusting. In the first 15 minutes you'll experience full-frontal male nudity (a piercing), dismemberment, vulgar language, and drug use. It gets worse from there. If you're fine with this, then you may ultimately be able to get through Tim & Eric. If you can't, then don't bother watching. The movie has plenty of funny jokes, although they do get repetitive; for example, the constant back and forth screaming/arguing gets annoying after a while, but Will Ferrell's winking segment was hilarious so that's one exception. And some jokes aren't funny at all. It's immature comedy so don't go in expecting something sophisticated or you'll be truly disappointed. The scene where Tim inspects and takes Jeffery was probably my favorite and so were the scenes that involved them. The ending is over-dramatic but hilarious as well. The biggest flaws are the long, drawn-out jokes that aren't very funny.With plenty of guest appearances, Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie was able to give me a few laughs and keep me interested to the end. If you want to watch this movie, I recommend checking it out on Netflix Streaming or Amazon Prime video (available on both as of 6/19/12)."
B0072C8ME0 Everyone that suffered through any of this lame, idiotic excuse for a film should be paid $1,000,000,000 for every minute they watched. In my case I made it through to 7 minutes & 12 seconds. Probably a record. I want my $7,200,000,000 NOW!!!Is this really suppposed to be funny????????????"
B0072C8ME0 I watched Tim & Eric on Cartoon Network while channel surfing and thought &#34;Wow, they have some weird looking people on this show.&#34; I watched this movie and laughed so hard. Many times I was like, that's so wrong and wanted to stop watching, but I couldn't.  Gross, lewd, outrageous, but hillariously funny!"
B0072C8ME0 If you love Tim & Eric's quirky awkward comedy, then this is the billion dollar movie for you. It's very different than 'Awesome Show' it plays like a real movie with very minimum random skits, but that doesn't take away from its awesomeness. Tim and Eric are given a billion dollars to make a movie for the evil Schlaaang corporation. Their movie bombs and they blow all the money. Tommy Schlaaang wants to kill them for blowing all his money, so they skip town in order to reopen a run-down mall. While trying to get the mall opened, all sorts of awkward hilarity ensues. I highly recommend TIM & ERIC'S BILLION DOLLAR MOVIE!!!"
B0072C8ME0 This movie was almost literally painful to watch. I waited for it to get better, but it somehow managed to just get worse. It is amazing that I can't even think of one good thing to say about it. Thank goodness it wasn't longer. I think it could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't just bad, but even in the weird and bizarre scenes it amazingly fails to be interesting. Absolute garbage pretty well sums it up, except that is probably being to kind to this movie (or perhaps unfair to actual garbage). I really wanted to give it zero stars."
B0072C8ME0 I'm not going to waste much of your precious time with this review. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. Will Farrell and Adam McKay are credited as producers, and should have known better.The film follows the monumentally untalented duo, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, as they set out to make a film for one billion dollars. They end up wasting the entire budget, a fact which the film's producer - Tommy Schlaaang (Robert Loggia, obviously working for the paycheck) - is not entirely thrilled about. The two idiots decide to renovate an old mall in hopes that they will be able to pay off the large debt. In the meantime, we are introduced to some of the most annoying, disgusting characters ever written, and are treated to insanely crude jokes involving pedophilia, feces, and body piercing.The writing is horrendous, the \"jokes\" are beyond disgusting and incredibly unfunny, and the two leads are headache inducing morons. Rarely have I ever been tempted to walk out of a film mid-screening. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is a waste of celluloid. I hated every single second of it.Magnolia Pictures has given the film the royal treatment on Blu-ray, which includes an audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.Directed by Tim and Eric, Rated R, 94 minutes"
B0072C8ME0 \"You spent a billion dollars on that piece of crap? I want my money back!\" After getting a billion dollars from a producer to make a movie Tim & Eric are surprised when he doesn't like it. After being given a time line on when to pay the producer back they are worried on where they will come up with the money, then they see a commercial. The two decide to move and run a broken down mall with the promise of making a billion dollars. This is not a movie for everyone. The people that will enjoy this are fans of really over the top, stupid comedy. Fans of Will Farrell will love this. Take the parts of \"Step Brothers\" and \"Anchorman\" that you were like \"what is that?\" and you will have this movie. Very, very gross in some parts but I laughed just about the whole way through. If your sense of humor is high and you like the over the top stupid Will Farrell type humor then this is for you. For all others, I would stay away at the risk of being offended. I however really liked this. Very funny. Overall, a very very funny comedy that isn't for the faint of heart. I give it a B+."
B0072C8RPE This was a good show, a little out there at times but did a great job of keeping you thinking the whole time.  I am looking forward to watching the next one."
B0072C8RPE I liked it but it's just not as engrossing as other mysteries.  too much striking the cigarette and smoking and trying to be intense.  The actor is &#34;there&#34; - just need better writers (a more intense story) to match David's ability."
B0072C8RPE The series became much better with blond actress. I love to see strong and smart women story lines, even though I am a male viewer."
B0072C8RPE Very explicit and disturbing to watch.the acting was good ,but I would not watch the rest of the series. Topic is child killing and a suspect very disturbed."
B0072C8RPE This series has a lot going for it, and the best part of it is that it keeps the viewer guessing as to the guilt or innocence of the accused until the very end. Where it fails is that it so successfully engages one into doubting the guilt of the perpetrator that when the denouement comes it seems too quick and out of character. The stories are terrific in painting pictures of a fractured society, with a very ugly underbelly--where people fall through the cracks and terrible things can and do happen. Often the individual sets[ I watched up to number five]deal with horrific events that happened to the perpetrator during childhood, or show children who are adversely affected by the crimes in the present.The first episode is the most chilling and realistic, more for its depiction of negligent and abusive parenting, poverty and the foster care system than for the actual crime. And whoever cast the series dipped into an amazing pool of talent, particularly when it came to the villains and the attorneys. The leading actors are less charismatic and the focus on their private lives took away from the police procedural [always in the first half], which is invariably taut and well written. Despite any shortcomings, I did enjoy the series, and it made me think -sometimes a good thing."
B0072C8RPE This program is very much like Law and Order from the English prospective and the laws on the books and how criminals are brought to justice.  Interesting and as most of the English detective programs I have watched...you never know the &#34;who done it&#34; until the very end.  Probably why this program as lasted so long!"
B0072C8RPE I have wanted to start this series for a long time so have only did one season.  Hope to be able  to try some of the others."
B0072N7XQC It's funny.  I loved the humor and the characters.  It was uplifting in a way, silly in a way, and hopeful in its own way.  It makes you want to be a FB too."
B0072N7XQC Was not to bad and the plot kept you plugged in enough to keep watching. Sort of a well made B movie."
B0072N7XQC Okay storyline, but it would probably have to get rewritten several times before it would be ready for the actual big screen.  A bit clun
B0072N7XQC I was curious about the Amazon Studios work, so I watched this.  Sure it could use some polishing, but will that come with time.  The story was funny, that acting wasn't bad, and I was entertained, which is the whole point isn't it?Keep making these Amazon Studios, you're onto something, and we're watching."
B0072N7XQC Personally I did NOT care for this movie, and would not recommend it to anyone.  However. I truly hated \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and that did well with the younger crowd so maybe you have something here."
B0072N7XQC I don't normally watched this genre but, the title caught my eye and being a \"Facebooker\", I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. If anything, I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed this!The first 10-15 minutes were a bit slow but, I feel it was necessary in order to set the stage for the entire movie. Perhaps, it could use just a little work. Otherwise, I wouldn't change much else.The actors were awesome! I simply LOVED Pants! He was my favorite character. He reminded me of Dr. House. Give Pants a haircut and a cane and he might be passed off as, Gregory House, MD. His eccentric personality certainly matched his at times. I guess you can tell I'm a fan of House? =)The other actor were fantastic as well. I felt they were \"naturals\". They did such a great job that about 40 minutes into the movie, I'd completely forgotten I was watching an amateur movie & not a big screen 5 star rated block buster. I honestly enjoyed it that much!It made me literally, LOL!"
B0072N8O4M The opening left me cold.  I was not interested at all in the movie until Blue started giving the back history of her childhood.  Little by little, I was reeled in and by the end, really enjoying the movie despite the story board shots.  That being said, I think this would make a much better TV series than a movie."
B0072N8O4M my opinion of this trial movie has been requested...i provide it here, and gratis (amazon, be grateful)...no one this side of a death wish would even consider translating this abomination into a feature...ciao."
B0072N8O4M I applaud the effort put into this movie and am editing my review after further consideration. The uniqueness of the girl's talent needs upgrading. I believe that would go a long way in increasing interest."
B0072N8O4M 2012NR: You could get just as valid predictive feedback from a well thought-out trailer (aka movie commercial) combined with an internet-based audience poll. Unless of course the intended audience are people who have nothing better to do than to watch a 1hr 37 min commercial about a product that doesn't yet exist. Can anyone say \"advance sale on partially built beach front condo's that never complete construction?\" ... MFJLabs -1x"
B0072N8O4M This was my first test movie, and it was more enjoyable than I thought it would be, given some of the other reviews of test movies I've seen.  I guess you just need to realize that this isn't a completed, polished movie.The animation and voice work was better than I thought it would be.  The premise of the story was interesting, and although I think a few areas of the script could use some work, I'd rate this as a positive experience.  It was loads better and more interesting than a lot of the movies shown on places like SyFy.  The \"love story\" needs a little more development, as does Blue's initial choice regarding Tyler. I was left scratching my head at that particular point in the script.  The typical Hollywood shortcuts were taken for the \"romance\", which I don't think presented Blue well.  It came across as more of \"I'll love whoever can touch me without giving me pain\", than about Tyler.  The \"twist\" wasn't very surprising to me, but I thought it was well played within the script, and actually made sense.  The ending leaves things open for a sequel, but also makes sense, given the hope presented to all Screamers during the final act.All in all, I'll be watching and reviewing other test movies.  Good job to all involved, and good luck with your project!"
B0072QWPSK 5 stars for another great reality showI find this show thrilling and also a bit DangerousI like the Gold that they recover, would highly recommend this show."
B0072QWPSK They were busy setting up township in Season 1. I looked forward to season ll and watching them dredge for gold under the sea. I saw some people up on top of Pinnel Mountain in Globe, Arizona do some dredging and I have seen several movies about dredging. It's very interesting."
B0072QWPSK For a fraction of the cost, people in home-made dredges are getting 100 - 1000 ounces of gold per season by dredging shallow waters off Nome Alaska. My first thought was: Why didn't Todd Hoffman get himself setup with a home-made dredge?This show has all of the human drama that Gold rush has. I love it !!"
B0072QWPSK I can't waite for next season. I will use Amazon more for streaming. The video quality was excellent. I like it better for using my Roku device."
B0072QWPSK This was an interesting show.  I chose this because I love Gold Rush and had heard of another Alaska Gold show.  Wow, there is definetly a difference in the two programs.  I gave this program  3 stars because at times I found myself really angry with the people and it was making my life miserable.  If you enjoy watching a dumb  _ _ _ screaming at the people that are trying to help you, then you'd like it.  This program shows several different groups of people using a &#34;diving&#34; method of a what I'd call a &#34;duck taped&#34; piece of wood or metal &#34;1/2 put together&#34; crap boat.  They dive down into the Bering Sea and use a powerful hose to suck up dirt, rocks and gold.  I am impressed however with all the gold that they bring up versus the TV show Gold Rush.  Some of these guys are getting amounts of gold in a DAY'S work, compared to the amount of all the gold that's found in ONE Season on Gold Rush.  These are definetly desperate people that don't have any quams about trying to &#34;get rich quick.&#34; This show films several groups of people; a father and son team, that are the only ones that actually have one of the nicest boats. they have an actual excavator on the boat to dig for gold and run it through their sluice boxes.  This team seems to get the most gold, but with all their equipment they have, they apparently have a ton of debt to pay off first.  Then you have this idiot guy who can not get along with anyone.  At the end of the show, the man that fronted the boat and equipment for this guy ends up FINALLY firing him and they actually get into a fight on the last show.  The others are a young man and women, the women of which doesn't know much about diving and freaks out every time, obviously not getting much work done.  And you find out that this other &#34;excentric&#34; guy that works only when he wants to, is this girls father. Yikes, some crazy people.  All in all, the good and the bad keep you wanting to watch it to see how much gold these people can get.  But at the same time if you can laugh off all the fighting and bleeped out (every other) words without getting frustrated and wanting to reach through the TV to strangle some of these people, then this is the show for you! Sorry can't recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy this kind of stuff."
B0073CMRKE 2 groups fighting arguing and in my opinion have nothing to do with weaponry.  I wish they would have included some normal people instead of guys who thinks they're a big shoot."
B0073CMRKE I LOVE Top Shot, and Season 4 was just as great as ever.  Great shooters, great weapons, great challenges, great &#34;what if&#34; shots.Okay, some of the challenges are kind of hokey; I mean, throwing rocks??  Really?You know, this is a clean show, and it doesn't have dumb youngsters hopping into beds willy-nilly.  These days, that is a great accomplishment."
B0073CMRKE Think top chef with guns.A ton of people, broken into teams, teams do challenges using weaponry from all ages (guns, rifles, bows, cannons, I think at one point even grenades.).Not a big fan of real violence, against real people, still and all fascinated by the technologies involved.The &#34;reality show&#34; elements... well, I tolerate them, not a big fan of that, even in this venue.The show is to the point, there is a lot of people interactions as the losing team has to put two people up to &#34;fight&#34; against each other in a challenge and the loser gets chucked off the show.Not a perfect show, but unique and to me anyway, it's fun to watch."
B0073CMRKE Top Shot is one of my favorite programs on television to date. That being said I watch it to see professionals use their tools at the top if the game. I do not enjoy the ridiculous melodrama the shows producers seem to think we need to make the characters \"interesting\".  Tell me more about their history and background, show me what they shoot at home, or where maybe, thst would interest me. I couldn't care less if one player likes another player. The show is about the weaponry and its implementation by expert hands. That is really all I wish to see. If it weren't for the attempt to show the most base of our behaviors by exploiting every minor drama I would have given the show five stars without hesitation."
B0073CMRKE The action is fast, but the targets are seen in slow motion.  An interesting way to highlight the skill needed to hit the targets."
B0073CMRKE I'm a big fan I really like the show and I'm glad Amazon makes it available.  I'm waiting for season 5 to be released now. I think I'll wait for it to be included with Amazon Prime though."
B0073CMRKE They always have some of the most interesting challenges. Was a good season, great marksman and not like the previous. (Dont want to say too much and give it away. But, Colby definitely stopped emphasizing TOP SCHOT, which is no fun anymore."
B0073CMRKE I am NOT a fan of reality TV or educational programming or game shows, but TOP SHOT is awesome! It's a great show with some cool weapons, and some really good shooters. Can't wait for season 5 all-stars."
B0073CMRKE The producers of &#34;Top Shot&#34; can be relied on to come up with new ways for taking the competition up a notch time and time again. Great show, and a stand out in today's world of TV wasteland.  John"
B0073CMRKE I think that this is a good show, they do some interesting things through out this show. But there is alot of bad drama."
B0073CMRKE Great show with great set of people, unlike the 2nd season.  Kolby does a great job as a host.  But he really needs to calm down on the teeth bleaching. Yikes!"
B0073CMRKE This was better than season 3 even though I really liked Dustin's performance in season 3.  This one had some behind the scenes skullduggery but, it wasn't tainted by the poor character of Luke on the season 3 series.  Overall they're all good seasons and the shooting skills of these people is unbelievable."
B0073CMRKE I have thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 seasons of Top Shot, and am currently about half way through this season.  It is just as good!"
B0073CMRKE Shooting is inherently boring. Other shooting shows like 'Sons of Guns' finish each episode with a shooting demo. But they always have a successful hit punctuated with a huge orange fireball explosion. Trust me. Shooting not like that. If I hit the bulls eye I find out by looking at a tiny round hole in a piece of paper.Top Shot has always had the best production values. They film and direct their shooting competition so as to extract the maximum amount of suspense and drama.But last season their backstory almost swamped the whole show. They also had teams who lived together and interacted when not on the firing range. But they included a crazy guy last season who tried to pick fist fights, who kept everyone else awake at night and who would employ any underhanded ploy to gain an advantage. He was black which lent a racial element to the proceedings. The whole thing was hard to watch.This season they have cut down on the dormitory psychodrama and emphasized the shooting.Good!"
B0073CMRKE Top Shot season 4 brings back everyone that makes the show good. The challenges are still awesome, teamwork and nominations are still important, a whole new array of weapons and the difficulty of show is increased. There were a lot more moments on the show where I felt that the challenges were much harder to do (Probubly one reason the gap between seasons has been so long). Also this season's female contestants feel like they actually have a chance at staying in longer (first time since Tara I've felt that way). Plus this season has a few firsts, what they are you'll just have to see.That being said I personally have a few flaws with this season. The cast, while intersting, didn't produce any huge characters that will be mentioned in later seasons (Ex. Ian, Kelly, Brad, George, Chris, Jake, Mike, Dustin).The winner, who deserved it, is the least impressive winner to me out of the four. This winner mearly outshot everyone, which is fine but has nothing added to it (season 1 a winner who turned every weapon to gold, season 2 best team player won, season 3 had the underdog become vertually unbeatable).Finally out of all the seasons, I feel this one has low replay value.These flaws actually prompted me to rewatch parts of season 2 and I grew to like it more then this.Still a very good season, is not worth skipping and a good edition to the top shot competitions. Now get the All Stars in Colby."
B0073CMRKE Always different and the people who make it on there are very interesting. And Colby is very easy on the eyes!"
B0073CMRKE I have to admit that the seasons finales from season 1, 2, 3 and 4 are good...its the individual episodes that make it exciting and VERY worthwhile for several reasons:1) You start to learn a lot of new and old ammo and weaponry2) You get to witness the ease (or difficulty) of old and modern day weaponry (and this is not just firearms!)3) You learn history about America and our military and police force that you did not previously know.4) Everything is tied together in a challenging but practical application that you can envision a need for in real life5) There is just the right amount of &#34;drama&#34; to keep the show interesting...but not irritating.Personally, I think TOP SHOT is one of the best &#34;reality shows&#34; put together in a long time.Kudos to the producers and directors for making this project a reality."
B0073CMRKE I watched the first season and there after and have noticed that the challenges and general format is improving.  I could do with more shooting and less drama but the fact that the producers show the drama makes it more real.  I'd recommend the show."
B0073CMRKE I think this is our favorite show as a family.  The skills are amazing but it also opens up discussions about how the people behave under pressure and how they treat each other and compete.  Valuable conversations to have with our son."
B0073J5X58 Entertaining and educational! I love this show!!! The cast is is amazing and funny. There is just so much awesome!"
B0073J5X58 I think Liz abeth does a great job.  She is funny, smart, sentimental and a woman too.  All of those great things wrapped up in an alligator hunter."
B0073J5X58 Love Troy ,  great show, my husband really likes it.  He watches this show every day, he even watches it more than once."
B0073J5X58 My eight year old grandson and I enjoy watching these episodes together. He loves learning about the swamp, gators, other wildlife, and most of all the hardy men and woman who call this watery untamed land home. So do I, thanks to him."
B0073J5X58 I really love this show and this season is just more of the things that made the first 2 great."
B0073J5X58 This is an interesting and exciting adventure in the south.  They do a great job of removing the gore and keeping your attention.  You get to know the characters and the culture.  It is very interesting and at times an edge of the seat kind of drama."
B0073J5X58 The first few shows were interesting, and tense, when the men went out gator-hunting.  What was unusual to me was how each show basically handled the same material - gator-hunting-but made it enough different to continue to hold my interest."
B0073J5X58 We wait all year for a new season of Swamp people, The folks feel like family and we cant wait to see how uncle Troy is doing !Even the cousins nobody wants to talk about LOL !!!!Duck Dynasty is our #1 this is a very close #2"
B0073J5X58 If you need to keep your husband interested and occupied this is the show.The people are down to earth and it's great for the whole family.With the exception of John Paul and his dad I always feel like they are over harvesting to many babies."
B0073J5X58 Very interesting season!  It was great they way they came back from the storm, how they helped neighbors who were adversely affected by the storm, and got back on their feet.  It is also to see the relationships between fathers and sons and the respect they have for each other."
B0073J5X58 Choot 'em!!! I guess some people might not like it that they actually kill those animals, but in reality, they must do something to control the population."
B0073J5X58 I watch Swamp people over and over.  It is fascinating what some people do for a living.  But this is one of those things that I wound't do for any amount of money.  Plus the characters on the show are real down to earth people and they make you feel like family.  I absolutely love Troy and his family.  Great series, you should give it a try.  It will definitely keep you rivited to your tv."
B0073J5X58 My husband an I love this reality series. We have gotten attached to these hard working real people. So interesting to see how they live and work in the swamp. The Dvd series arrived on time and good quality. Priced right. The whole series cost less than many single videotapes."
B0073J5X58 I bought this show for my Husband more so than for me.  He thinks it is great and loves the show because of the people. As he says they speak his language.We're from South East Missouri on the Eastern side of the Ozark Mountains. He gets a kick out of the subtitles for people who may not understand what these folks are saying.  He and our youngest son understand every word and phrase spoken.  It is a language that is learned if you live any where near the South. Only the French that is thrown in is different than what we grew up with. But even in some parts of our state, other languages find their way in, including French.Swamp People is basically about Alligator Season in Louisiana and the people that participate in the catching and harvesting of these magnificent animals.I personally would like to see more about the people and a little less about how to catch Alligators. After three seasons, I think we know how it is done.The show may seem brutal to some folks and it is a job that dictates you being brutal or you may end up as lunch for the Gators. Probably not a good show for the very young unless you are willing to take the time and patience to explain what is going on.The people that star in Swamp People are just what they are.  Common everyday people, with families and pets that have learned how to carve a living out of the swamp.  If we lived there I'm sure we would be just as involved as they are. No matter where you may go in this great country, you are going to find these types of people.  People making a living out of the natural resources they have around them.My only hope is that this show doesn't ruin the people who star in it.  It seems that too many times we see folks getting involved with television and then they loose sight of where they have come from. They loose touch with the very thing the show is about.  I hope for them that they know when to pull the plug and go back to being  who they are. It concerns me that for them becoming a celebrity, may get in the way of their families and the life they love.The show is well done and seems to be free of a lot of cursing and fowl language. What is said is usually done in the excitement of the catch and capture.  It is well edited and \"Bleeped\". I would however give it a PG-13 rating.We are also excited about the next season to come.  I'm sure season four will be just as much fun to watch as the first three seasons have been.If you are looking for something different than cops, lawyers or medicine shows, then this is a great alternative. I recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning about life in our Southern most areas of our nation. Life in the swamps of Louisiana."
B0073J5X58 i will write what i write,and i did realy enjoy what AMERICA at one time was,meaning families working towards a common goal,Survival..."
B0073J5X58 My husband and I watch this series together at least 3 episodes a night when t.v. sucks.  We laugh yet are mesmerized by the people who do this for a living."
B0073J5X58 Love this show. Such a funny  and exciting show. Makes you think you are right there with them....trying to catch gaters too"
B0073J5X58 I'm personally not a big fan but it is nice to see families working together and passing down traditions.  My husband is the real fan here."
B0073J5X58 Love this show. There are a bunch of different people on the show,telling you and showing you how they make a living in the swamps of Louisiana."
B0073J5X58 always enjoy watching swamp people and the things they do to make a living in the swamps catching gators and ?"
B0073J5X58 It's interesting to watch how people make a living in a way that is so very different.  Dangerously funny.  Enjoy."
B0073J5X58 The show follows down to earth honest hard working gator hunters in Louisiana.  The people that the show chose are excellent they really pinpointed the right combinations in season 3.  I love watching every family and story."
B0073J5X58 This program is alright on its own, but we enjoy it the most with a few beers and with the captions covered over so that we can guess at what Troy is saying."
B0073J5X58 Found this series to be interesting enough to watch all three seasons so far. A good show for the hunters and fishers out there!"
B0073J5X58 This program is an average interest DVD.  Many critical reviews are available on the internet, and almost all of them gave this program either a Three Star, or Four Star rating. What else can be said?"
B0073J5X58 I love the outdoors,nature,this is a way of life that I can see me living.Sadly I don't,it wasn't meant for me so I get to watch it on these episodes and I love to watchem!!"
B0073J5X58 Get on a boat, look for croc, find croc, shoot in the head. Repeat. The entire thing! At one point there is a storm lol."
B0073J5X58 My husband and I watch this show together to relax.  These guys and gals really work hard to make their living!"
B0073J5X58 Can not wait for Season 4 to start.  It is always exciting to see how big &#34;The Big One&#34; is going to be this year."
B0073J5X58 This season is even better than the last.  Some of the characters have evolved in a positive manner.  These people are a testament to family and community."
B0073J5X58 Great show. You get hooked on the characters. Really like the hard work values and laid back ways of this bunch."
B0074279LU At long last this show is available!  A childhood favorite!"
B0074279LU While this series did over do it on the action sometimes it was still a very well made and fun cartoon to watch. I would definitely recommend this dvd."
B0074279LU X-Men is by far one the greatest comic books out there. The story lines were just creative and all the X-Men characters are simply awesome. Glad I watched this series again."
B0074279LU this season was awesome and it had a little bit of all the characters which was great like seeing Cable and Bishop in action not to mention Gambit my 3 favorite x-men yeah wolverines behind them in my list.it shows days of future past part 1 and 2 which there making the movie for now, not sure if the movie will be like the cartoon though seeing that so far I noticed Gambit isn't even in the movie and he's the reason why Bishop comes back in the past because mystiq transformed into gambit and killed the president so he had to go back in the past and kill gambit but later found out it was mystiq, then rouge comes in and breaks bishops thing to send him back to his time cause in the cartoon rouge and gambit are kinda like on and off going out, I really hope for the movie to be like the cartoon, if they don't have gambit in the movie I wont even bother watching it."
B0074279LU Watching this is like a trip in a time machine to 1965.  The colorful 2D animation is a hoot.  The good guys are obviously the good guys, (even with the angst of trying to find themselves) they are and remain the good guys.All in all its fun if you find yourself in the mood for uncomplicated plots served up with color and style of the past."
B007427K8W Tosh is one of the funniest stand ups I have seen. I was glad when the show started and am glad that I have been able to watch a few seasons on Amazon Instant Video."
B007427K8W Hilarious summary of all of the best internet videos.  Not politically correct and awesome.  Why waste hours surfing YouTube when you can see the best in a fraction of the time."
B007427K8W I absolutely love this show!  I started with season 1 on amazon and watched season 4.  It's a bit disappointing season 2 & 3 aren't free with Prime but I hope that may change.  This show is hilarious, distracts me from whatever may be going on in my life and I can sit there and laugh out loud at the show.  You can tell Daniel Tosh and his crew put a lot of work into finding the best for each episode.  Plus- he's very good looking so that is a bonus! : )"
B007427K8W To me, and i have seen his concerts.  Chris Rock is the best comedian on the planet. Tosh is easily second in comedy for me. the guy is fast on his feet, just as fast as rock if not faster. he hits topics hard and nothing is out of bounds.  chris rock will talk about the pope to rape, molestation, to anything that comes to his mind. Tosh is no different. The topics are different. Tosh really engages the audience and you feel apart of what he is doing.  I love the show. Love his stand up.  I  did not get hooked right away.  but when i  did, now rock and tosh are an addiction for me now.  give it a try. but you have to have flexibility in your humor.  or you will not like this show.  they take the most disgusting things on the internet and its even hard for me to watch. people getting hurt, and stuff with food, and just plain stupidity.  its all there for a great laugh.  5 stars all the way."
B007427K8W This is a super funny show.  I love the clips ....most of the time.  There is a big deal on this show involving puke.  A lot of puke.  After a while it wears on you so, be prepared for it.  I am a sympathetic puker so, this was a little challenging.  Other than that it's really good.  the skits are fun, the clips are classic and the host is a good looking dude who may or may not be gay.  Either way give this a test drive just ....you know...watch out for all the puke."
B007427K8W Tosh.O makes me laugh everytime I watch it and I am glad it is on amazon prime avaliable for me to watch it thank you"
B007427K8W some of his humor it too brutal- ie harsh videos that are of the JACKASS variety, His personal deliver is smooth and funny."
B007427K8W This show is really witty and I like how he pokes fun at his guests without them even being aware that he's mocking them in front of his viewers.  Like all of his nudity too!"
B007427K8W My husband and I enjoy watching this together.  It's good for something light in the background when you're doing something else...such as browsing Amazon.  :)"
B007427K8W Tosh is very intelligent. I love to listen to his excellent verbiage and creative references. The writing is very clean and clever. I could not stop watching it. I would have given it 5 stars, but he plugged too much his other businesses. But I liked his video redemption's the best. he is a very attractive man with an open mind and great sense of humor. I really really enjoyed all of these."
B007427K8W Not bad.  It's just a show that gets video from all over the internet and one segment where they invite a person from one of the videos on their show.  Daniel Tosh does an OK job as the host."
B007427K8W It's funny with a lot bigger budget, tosh seems a lot more confident and willing to push the limits with adult humor."
B007427K8W For those who have not heard of this show, you have to go into watching Tosh.0 with the understanding there is nothing sacred or untouchable when it comes to the subject comedy and humor.  This can be extremely funny and refreshing (in a society hell-bent on allowing itself to be subdued by a politically correct police state) - but the extremely funny bits are surrounded by seemingly endless acres of the same recycled potty humor in order to fill the creative voids (of which there are many).A large chunk of the show is apparently aimed at adolescent minds - but the show as a whole is completely inappropriate for all non-adults.  Incessant and repeated &#34;b-hole&#34;, vomit and other assorted potty humor is the normal subject matter.  Graphic and many times violent internet videos are used as the centerpiece and subject matter for much of the comedy.  So consider yourself warned.Again - race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity - and pretty much anything is/are all fair game in this show&#8230; and the satire should be obvious for some.  Nevertheless, do not watch if your overly sensitive and easily offended - because if you are, this show will offend you.  Enjoy!"
B007427K8W Not too funny to me, but my daughter lines Tosh .not sure what else to say here. Amazon is smazing."
B007427K8W Tosh isn't for everyone. But if you love crude and rude and politically incorrect humor and weird web redemption's then Tosh is your man."
B007427XS4 Some of the funniest skits ever done on TV, these guys are hilarious! Key and Peele present life in a different light."
B007427XS4 This team can do it all: Literary, silly, insightful, dirty, intellectual.  When they play female characters, they play the characters, not the tired old gag of men in dresses. Amazing writing and cinematography."
B007427XS4 Not my kind of comedy. I think that the younger generation may like this more. The whole concept is very thin."
B007427XS4 Hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  I'm talking in-the-house-by-yourself-neighbors-can-hear-you-laughing hilarious.Think Chappelle's show for a smarter audience.  No offense to chappelle, as I've had some great times with it, but this show is faster, more clever, waaay more varied, and much more consistent.You won't be able to choose a favorite between Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key.  These guys are the present and future of comedy."
B007427XS4 These guys are too funny for words. I mean lol funny. They touch all ethnic groups because they can love them"
B007427XS4 Never heard of them but now I can wait to see them again and again. Will have you laugh out loud for sure."
B007427XS4 The first episode was especially awesome but so far each episode has had at least one sketch that has made us laugh out loud."
B007427XS4 This show is hysterically funny. I can't get enough of it.I like the fact that half of this pair of comedians is black and the other half is white. So with their multicultural background, they can make comical jokes about certain things on different cultural perceptions.2 comedians. Hilarious jokes. Stand-Up comedians with multicultural backgrounds who go back and forward with and build off each other's jokes. And they do sketch comedy as well. You wouldn't want to miss it."
B007427XS4 Key and Peel - that's the number one reason for the 5 star rating.  Loved these guys on MAD TV and were thrilled to find them on Amazon."
B007427XS4 Funny, fresh, nuanced and deeply humanistic..  Both are excellent actors with a wide range and cute to boot!  2 more words: watch them!"
B007427XS4 This show was very entertaining.  It is definitely not a family show because it contains a decent amount of language.  I offers a great variety of humor."
B007427XS4 A-A-ron, white p/black v, and slave auction (trust me-social satire) are hilarious! There are fillers with them talking to the audience which are hit or miss. No all the skits are great, some go on too long, but most will make you laugh out load. Hopefully SNL will finally take the hint from this show and not rely on white Canadians doing impressions all the time or stars who cannot read and act at the same time."
B007427XS4 They are funny as heck and need to get more props.  They get it in like David Chappell with great skits"
B007427XS4 These guys are so funny.  I had just started watching the first serious maybe a month ago, and now I am finished with the second one.  I hope Season 3 goes Prime!!!!"
B007427XS4 Many parts are funny but why curse if you know before hand that their going to blip the words out. It seems as though every fourth word is an open space in the dialogue. It gets annoying after awhile."
B007427XS4 You may actually die laughing at this show! It is smart, hillarious and no one is safe from being the butt of a joke!"
B007427XS4 A few of the skits were concepts \\I had seen before on other skit shows, but there's no denying these two's comedic chemistry"
B007427XS4 To be fair I only gave this outstanding comedy four stars because I have only watched two episodes and so I cannot judge the whole season.  If you remember Laugh In with Rowan and Martin from way back when you get somewhat of an essence of what this comedy team is all about.  This is true cross-over comedy as both are bi-racial and the comedy is only richer because of it.  Active and energetic this team brings a new dynamic into comedy.  Skits are good and well thought out and a pleasure to watch."
B007427XS4 I watch a lot of their skits on youtube and I must say they are funny. My only issue is the way the show is put together. I don't want no introduction or monologue. Just feed me the damn cake!!"
B007427XS4 These guys are pretty funny.  The skits that aren't that funny just really really aren't funny, but they are few and far between."
B007427XS4 These guys are great. I remember them from Mad TV. They have come along way from then. A Very Good show!!"
B007427XS4 Key & Peel is such a funny show!  I love how offbeat their humor is.  So many of their sketches start out totally traditional, but then take turn for Crazy Town.  They catch me off guard and either make me laugh or wonder what just happened."
B007427XS4 Key and Peele is a very funny show while also being extremely edgy.  Hopefully they will be able to keep this up for several more seasons."
B00742GOP2 It hasn't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing. That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is. I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off.I cannot recommend this movie in any way."
B00742GOP2 This could have been a really good sci-fi movie, but it attempts to be \"Dawn of the Dead\" at the end.  And fails miserably.  It's more watchable than the Sci-Fi network's wreck of the week, but not by much.  Good actors hamstrung by an awful script.  Actually, I may have to take that Sci-Fi statement back.  At least you know what's going on, (and probably know the whole movie), within the first few minutes.  This piece of dreck doesn't seem to know where it's going or what's it's all about until half way through this slog.  Confused about the first 2 minutes of the film?  Don't worry.  It ties back in somewhere toward the end.  Assuming you want to wait that long to find out.  Even if it was free, you're better off re-watching \"Night of the Living Dead\".  You'll feel dead after watching this crap."
B00742GOP2 Ok it was good, actually it was very good though its a slow subtle start and just when it picks up and gets heated with zombie mania the film ends; but that's a good thing since you can then go and watch \"The Walking Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead', '28 Days Later' or any other zombie film and finally feel like you understand how all the madness came to pass.  Now its pretty realistic except for two pieces in the story line that just doesn't add up.  You have a doctor who has discovered a miracle drug for HIV/AIDS, its experimental but performing so well everyone is urging him to publish the findings and get it approved but he doesn't feel its ready yet, he needs more sample cases, this is how meticulous the man is as a scientist, researcher doctor.  Now keeping this in mind he gets an emergency patient who's condition is critical. So what does he do? He uses the experimental drug on this patient.Gross inconsistencies:1. A doctor can lose his license for using an experimental drug on a patient who hasn't given consent, and is basically underage, as the drug isn't FDA approved. So why would a doctor who's so meticulous about his research on this miracle drug up and do something as medically irresponsible as use it on a patient he hasn't treated before (knows no medical history) and where there's no formal diagnoses of what had gone wrong critical or not?  Well the answer is that a doctor who is really as good as this one is supposed to be wouldn't do that.  He's not portrayed as a mad scientist after all but as someone who adhere's to protocol.  So this part of the story doesn't make sense and it nags at one like one big loose end.2.  The disease is passed through blood or saliva.  The doctor is bitten by the emergency patient after he's injected with miracle drug that makes whatever he initially had mutate and become aggressive. Fine.  In the scene the doctor is wearing a lab coat when he gets bit and its obvious that he is bleeding under the lab coat but the lab coat is in no way frayed or ripped, suggesting that he wouldn't have had any contact with the patience saliva. Also note that when they first treat this emergency walk in they don't use any gloves while taking samples and dealing with the patient which isn't standard protocol in hospitals. They actually have wall disposable glove canisters in the rooms.Anyway the second point if forgivable but the first one is a claw in the lions paw, even still this is a really really good film and a must watch for those who love the whole zombie thing.  I like the fact that is so subtle, that they don't fall for cheap frights or over the top zombie art makeup.  I also like the idea that they leave the end open in term of its taking you to the point where the break-out of the disease is out of control.  Its explaining the zombie phenomenon more than it is giving you the zombie's on the loose scenario or how to survive a zombie apocalypse.  Taking the role as the prequel to all zombie films puts this film in a very unique place of its own.  I would recommend this to horror and zombie fans, I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in distinctive filmmaking. And I would recommend this to anyone who ever thought that a zombie apocalypse was outside the realm of reality. In fact this film is disturbing as it resonates long after the film is watched.I think this is a good rental and I think its a good enough film for someone to own (if this is your kind of thing)."
B00742GOP2 I rented this film but did not have time to watch, but as soon as I am able to see it will review it. It has got some descent reviews since its release."
B00742GOP2 Dr. Andrew Stanton (Brian Krause) Is a confident and successful ER doctor. He is also working on a cure for AIDS. ( I smell Nobel.) He has a beautiful wife (Sierra Fisk) and daughter (Islay Vermillion) he needs to spend more time with. Just as when things are going his way, his life turn upside down as he accidentally creates a bacteria that makes people aggressive and is highly contagious.Now I know this sounds like a great zombie-type film and it would have been if it hadn't taken up nearly the whole film to develop. As it was we had a slow moving drama/thriller with a touch of horror at the end that wasn't worth 60 minutes of character development.Available on a 30 Horror Film Collection.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Sex and brief nudity (?)."
B00751IYQ4 Though the end result may be predictable the route that \"The Decoy Bride\" takes to get there is not.  Katie(Kelly MacDonald) is an aspiring writer unlucky in love who lives in a Scottish Island coastal village.  One day the village is visited by James(David Tennant) an accomplished writer whose attempts to marry a paparazzi stalked American actress,Lara(Alice Eve), are thwarted at every turn.  James employs Katie to stand-in for Lara in a bogus marriage.  Think you know where this one is going?  You would be surprised to know that \"The Decoy Bride\" offers fresh insight into love, romance, and marriage.  The three principal actors are terrific and imbue their characters with depth.  This is an adult film in the sense that between the laughter it offers food for thought."
B00751IYQ4 We watched this last night on a hunch and found it to be a treasure. We were not familiar with any of the cast and found them all to be thoroughly enjoyable in their portrayals of the characters in the movie.This has a totally different feel to it and places the viewer very quickly on a remote Scottish island where ordinarily nothing ever happens but that is about to change. The movie reeks with charm and atmosphere and captivated us from the very beginning. After only a few minutes we knew we were in for a completely different sort of film experience and wound up having a lot of fun with the story and the cast.This is suitable for the entire family and provides a fun evening's entertainment; I recommend it highly."
B00751IYQ4 It was a funny movie. I liked it. It is not the best movie I have every seen, but on the whole it was quite enjoyable."
B00751IYQ4 I'm not the first to say that the secret to success in comedy is timing.  Well, truth be told, it's also the secret to success in matters of the heart, and THE DECOY BRIDE seizes this wonderful metaphor and puts it to the test with two charming leads in a rather formulaic (but no less winning) attempt.Lara Tyler (played by Alice Eve) is a world famous movie star desperately trying to pull of the wedding nuptials of her dreams, only to have it constantly halted by hounding and intrusive paparazzi.  Her beau, author James Arber (David Tennant of the BBC's DOCTOR WHO fame), provides the inspiration in the guise of his recent book, \"The Ornithologist's Wife,\" a romantic bestseller taking place of dreamily idyllic Scottish island of Hegg.  In hopes of throwing the press off the movie star's trail, her agent concocts what he believes will be the perfect \"secret\" wedding: they'll travel to the real island of Hegg (population 79) and stage it entirely within the fairy tale castle of Arber's book.  To further confuse the media watchdogs, they'll stage a fake wedding, hiring a local girl named Katie (Kelly MacDonald of HBO's BOARDWALK EMPIRE) to play the bride.  Nothing ever quite goes as planned, and, after a ceremony that unintentionally weds James to Katie, the two find themselves on-the-lamb trying to outsmart photographers bent on snapping the fateful picture of Lara Tyler's dream wedding!Of course, all of it sounds more than a bit convoluted, but such is the nature of a good-spirited marital farce.  None of it is to be taken entirely seriously, and, so far as THE DECOY BRIDE is concerned, it's a fun little picture, performed to appreciable laughs for an audience willing to suspend their disbelief for all of its 89 minutes.  In fact, much of the success is due precisely to the leads - pairing Tennant with MacDonald was a stroke of genius, so much so that I'd welcome their trying all of this again in another picture.  Tennant brings the same kind of goofy, loopy charm that worked so well throughout his stint as the legendary DOCTOR WHO, and, on BOARDWALK EMPIRE, MacDonald is largely buried under the weight of much heavier material.  Both talents have a clear understanding of the story's central chemistry - that love conquers all - and they attack it with enough zeal to make it all work as well as it can and does.Also, it's one of those rare experiences we've all had: by virtue of the film's trailer, I thought I would've laughed much more.  This is a textbook example of how marketing execs really do have something to offer studios by way of excellent editing; had some of the pacing been more tightly constructed in the completed picture, some of the material may've been more effectively entertaining.  As it stands, it's only `modestly' entertaining, clearly rising to the level of \"cute & clever\" but missing the mark of \"farce\" by a few seconds.  It's the difference between producing a film that clocks in at 89 minutes as is when 80 minutes may prove better comic timing BUT too short for a theatrical release.  You say tomato, I say tomato.  Still, I enjoyed its mild enchantment just the way it was.THE DECOY BRIDE was produced by IFC Films, Cinemanx, and Isle of Man Film in association with Creative Scotland, Hanway Films, and Ecosse Films.  The story was written by Sally Phillips and Neil Jaworski, and it was directed by Sheree Folkson.  The film looks solid - colors are understandably muted throughout due to locations and shooting interiors - and the sound mix is good, though I'll admit that the wife and I had some trouble adapting our ears to the thick Scottish accents, so studios take note to give the feeble American ears an English subtitle track, will ye?  Special features include celebrity interviews, a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scene (one, and it certainly didn't need to be in the picture), FX shots, and the theatrical trailer.RECOMMENDED.  Yeah, ok, it's got a few flaws.  Maybe even it's a mild deviation of the happy formula that used for every romantic comedy.  Still, THE DECOY BRIDE has its own charm - much of it derived from the chemistry of its two imminently likable leads - and that provided enough fuel for this reviewer to stay with it `til the end.  Plus, there's a wholesome fun in rooting for true love to finally win the day, even when it takes some time to itself.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener of THE DECOY BRIDE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B00751IYQ4 This was a delightful and surprising movie. Yes, it's a bit unrealistic and they fall in love too quickly, but if you can look past that, you're sure to appreciate the humor, the sweet romance, and the stunning scenery. During the first fifteen minutes, I'll admit to not being sure if I would enjoy it, but the more I watched, the more I wanted to watch. It is truly a charming story meant to entertain and delight. If you don't laugh and smile along the way, then you didn't watch the same movie as I did, or perhaps you did, but from a different point of view. I would recommend it, and I may even watch it again."
B00751IYQ4 Dull and uninspired script can't be saved by a likable cast.  Honestly, I wanted to like this, but it was rather dull and I kept waiting for it to get better, be more clever, have something emotionally bonding I could relate to, but it just coasted slowly along until the predictable ending.  David Tennant's character wasn't particularly likable as the insecure one-hit writer.  The two women he ends up choosing between are both very pleasant, attractive, and decent--which was a nice change from the usual tripe of the snooty, spoiled actress vs. the sincerely lovable shopgirl.  He was simply out of his league with the actress and finally realized the shopgirl was a better match.  Ho Hum.  I like David Tennant in his other work, but he brought nothing new or appealing to this film.  It was if he was on holiday and just walked through the role.  I wonder if he was bored with the script, too?"
B00751IYQ4 This movie may seem like it has a predictable ending, but it is such a fun trip getting there.  Part of the charm is the adorable Scottish accents and the beautiful Scottish scenery, of course, but it was a treat to see excellent acting by actors other than the usual handful of Academy Award nominees.A beautiful, famous American actress is marrying a Scottish author in Scotland while attempting to avoid droves of paparazzi.  When they discover the photographers are on their trail, a decoy bride (Kelly MacDonald, a local pretty young lady) is hired to throw them off by having a fake wedding.  There is clever dialogue and a fun romp through beautiful scenery.  I recommend it."
B00751IYQ4 Yes, it's a bit predictable, but it's still enjoyable-the scenery is beautiful too. The plot is sweetly funny, familiar but with some new twists that keep it from being smarmy."
B00751IYQ4 This one caught my eye because I am a fan of David Tennant (\"Blackpool\") so it really was a pig in a poke. What I bought was actually a lovely little romantic comedy that has some of the wittiest dialogue I've had the pleasure to hear, no bad guys, and several people to root for.We are on a remote island in the Hebrides where an internationally known movie star is trying to get married without the army of paparazzi who relentlessly hound her tracks. Her publicist and her staff have scouted out a castle on this particular island based on her favorite book written by her fianc&eacute;. They need a decoy to lure the photographers off the scent.Here are some of the actors:* Alice Eve (\"Star Trek into Darkness\") is that famous actress. Not only is she famous, she's smart, kind, talented and resourceful.* David Tennant (\"Blackpool\") is the author of her favorite book. He now  has writer's block but is completely agog over his famous fianc&eacute;e.* Kelly MacDonald (\"Boardwalk Empire\") is a local girl come home to lick her wounds. She followed a musician to London but discovered she still has a knack for finding guys who have a fear of commitment.Our actress's staff decides to do a pretend wedding to throw the paparazzi off track. They offer our local girl a LOT of cash; it's tempting because her terminally ill mother wants to see the world before she dies.This is a cheery little film with charming people, an off-beat hamlet, eccentric locals and lovely scenery. It's sweet and predictable, and I'm soooo glad! I got my copy from Amazon."
B00751IYQ4 I got tired of romantic comedies once Owen Wilson seemed to overtake the market. However, a few Welsh actors, a beautiful backdrop, and some well-timed slap-stick gags combined with some great on-screen chemistry made me love the genre again! Highly, highly recommend!"
B00751IYQ4 This was a cute romantic comedy.  The characters are likeable and funny.The heroine, Katie, is a typical woman.  She's believable in every way because she isn't model-like beauty and she isn't a damsel in distress bull.  I liked this character very much.The hero, James, was also likeable.  But the writers could have developed his character more.  We don't learn much about why he decided to google about a place for his book.  Why he put so much detail about this Scottish Island called Hegg, calling it beautiful and all these other terms he used from a thesaurus. This book somehow became a bestseller.  And now the poor guy has writer's block.  But he is happy because he's about to marry a world famous actress (think Angelina Jolie).  But this woman doesn't want the press involved and with rightful reasons.  I just didn't really like her though. She comes off as needy and spoiled.The acting in this was great.  It does have an all star cast that bring their own funny little quirks.Kelly MacDonald (Boardwalk Empire: The Complete First Season&Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)) plays the likeable average Katie.  She is both funny and perfect for this role.David Tennant (Doctor Who: The Complete Second Series&Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)) plays James.  Now I liked David.  His romantic side is very likeable.  But I still expected him to lick his lips from time to time like he did in Goblet of Fire (played a bad guy with this lick habit).This movie is an enjoyable romantic comedy to watch if in need for something light and funny."
B00751IYQ4 .Loved it!  I thought this was a totally charming romantic comedy.  Kelly MacDonald is absolutely charming and her lilting way of speaking makes her near irresistible! This also has a good soundtrack.Decent romantic comedy story (it follows the usual formula for a romantic comedy - but so what?).  It is the actors and their accents that sell this movie, and the lovely footage of whatever island they shot this movie is a nice bonus. I enjoyed all the characters on the island - especially the old deaf couple.This is a movie I will enjoy many times!"
B00751IYQ4 Yeah ok, so it's a little predictable (what romantic comedy isn't??) but it's still a sweet movie. There are some funny and touching moments, too.  I love the scene with the old couple and the bagpipes.  And the comment about the wind beneath my wings is classic!  I thought the characters were mostly good, other than the \"real\" bride... she sort of annoyed me lol. Oh yeah, and the accents seem to come and go, but that happens a lot in movies, too. But other than that, I did love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies."
B00751IYQ4 I usually don't watch rom-coms. Too many forced laughs. Too many beautiful, dream-job-having women who can't find a man because they fall down too much (until they fall right into the arms of Mr. Right). Too much Hollywood pizzazz. I picked out this movie to have something in the background while I practiced drawing. I ended up grabbing a few snacks, drinks, and settling in on the couch within the first 15 minutes.The characters and plot are very easy-going. And while there are quite a few exaggerated scenes/characters played for laughs, they are more background. The characters are exaggerated just enough from real life to make it fun and interesting, but not so much that it's distracting or corny. The beautiful scenario of Northern Scotland didn't hurt, either."
B00751IYQ4 Love this movie, lots of fun and different...I recommend it highly...and watch it often! Hope you do too! bye bye"
B00751IYQ4 This is a tedious slow boring movie of Scottish people trying to be funny....They are not.  I made it 45 minutes before finally turning it off in disgust.  I think the Director's family wrote the rest of these reviews as the seem to have no concept of character development or an interesting story..."
B00751JL2K The director relies too much on shock, gore and camera tricks to create a sense of tension.  However these effects as used in this move act as a distraction.  The movies that are successful in creating a tension leave a lot to the imagination which is far scarier than fake blood poured all over the place.  If this movie is in fact made by teen agers, koodos to them a very good effort.  If however it is a professional production... yikes... not so good."
B00751JL2K Good movie! Liked it alot! The story line was very good. Christian Slater played a creepy cop alittle to well. The ending was good. Definately a good buy!"
B00751JL2K I found it interesting from the start. It held your attention and it was sort of complex (everything makes sense at the end). I don't believe in giving spoilers, so I won't - but, you should give this a watch. I gave it four stars as a B flick, but I lean more towards A rated. You have murder, perversion and possession all wrapped up in this film. It's going in my collection of DVD's!"
B00751JL2K ----------------------------------------\"Playback\"----------------------------------------This is a creepy, genuinely disturbing, graphically violent slasher/horror movie about a kind of demon that passes from person to person via videotape and film, sort of a cross between \"Damien\" and \"The Ring.\" Although the violence can be a bit nauseating, the script is deliberate and multilayered, moving calmly from one unexpected turn of events to another. If you don't like scary movies, avoid this... But if you do, you'll dig it. It's creepy. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
B00751JL2K Poor, poor Christian Slater.  He's gone from being a reliable presence in slacker or rebel style movies to playing bit roles, such as the borderline-pedophile police officer in PLAYBACK.  I don't know what's sadder: the fact that he's sunk so low or he's given second billing in the advertising when, realistically, he's barely in the picture?  Meh.  Maybe I'm overanalyzing the situation.  I guess it's nothing to lose your head about.Julian (played by Johnny Pacar) is working on a school project meant to explore local history.  His choice?  He and his friends are re-enacting on video a local family murder mystery.  However, when he learns that there was a survivor of the event - an infant who has curiously gone unreported from the press surrounding the event - he's drawn deeper and deeper into uncovering what may be the real secret, and it may lead him to his very doorstep!For all its portents, PLAYBACK is a harmless flick, a lazy diversion available on video stores shelves nationwide.  Part-slasher, part-techno-thriller-lite, part-teen-flick, it never quite irons out what it can do best, and that's probably tapping into society's collective fear of all things technological.  It probably would've made for a better script - or, at least, one that made more sense than the supernatural way the killer uses video devices to transmits his nefarious desires into the minds of others - but perhaps that wouldn't have been what writer/director Michael A. Nickles wanted.  As it is, PLAYBACK feels similar in tone to such quick flicks as FINAL DESTINATION or maybe even any entry in the SCREAM saga, but it lacks the depth - as well as lacks the depth in any performance here - though I'll admit it tries hard.These days, horror films genuinely are a dime-a-dozen, and it's probably cheaper and easier to go the cheaper and easier way all along.  Why put serious effort in when a modest production - with a respectable budget and respectable players - can deliver any studio a modest payday?  PLAYBACK succeeds modestly as a cautionary tale about youth being co-opted by evil forces, and that's the only level is excels on.  That's a disappointment, mostly because the crisp editing works so well.  Everything looks better than the story makes sense.  All of the players do the best they can with what they've been given - while there are no break-out performances here, everyone appears comfortable \"phoning it in,\" a curious choice given the fact that the script hints at cell phones proving to be near and dear to the central menace.It's passable fare ... and what better Thespian to have on board than Christian Slater for passable fare?The film is produced by Magnet Releasing, Fontenay Films, Ltd., Bennett Robbins Productions, and Emmett/Furla Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  It all looks and sounds as good as any other thriller-lite.  The disc comes with a brief behind-the-scenes featurette, a photo gallery, and the film's trailer.RECOMMENDED only for fans of slasher-style horror, though they'll probably find very little here to genuinely love.  PLAYBACK isn't a failure; I think it just fails to capture any legitimate narrative.  Everything happens because of some mystical connection from the past fueled through the magic of home video - a device already explored to vastly greater effect in quite a few other movies, not only THE RING or RINGU, depending upon your preference.  When TV was invented, in fact, there was a pocket of civilization that warned us of bad things to come from all of those radio and TV waves buzzing through the air; methinks that maybe they foresaw film duds like PLAYBACK a century earlier.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener of PLAYBACK by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B00751JL2K An evil demon is about to visit. What blows your mind as much as the sudden visit is Where it's coming from! Highly recommended for all horror lovers. The acting performance is excellent, there is Fear everywhere and the fright will knock your socks off. Entertaining it is indeed right to the end as you sit on the edge-of-your-seat. What happens next will certainly leave you with Nightmares!"
B00751JL2K Playback is not a scary movie. It didn't build any tension and the jump-out scares didn't work. The acting was about average, and so was the music. The story is what stood out to me and basically saved this movie. It's not really like The Ring, although it does have some elements from it. The story is actually creative and has some decent twists at the end. The tape in Playback basically possess those who watch it and the tape goes back for generations in the family. The film is based around teenagers, but isn't like your average teenage slasher. The intro was violent and probably the best part of the film, by the way.If you have time to kill or are slightly interested in this movie, check it out on Amazon Prime or Netflix streaming (available on both as of 6/15/12). Don't expect anything too scary cause you may come out disappointed.The movie has gore, sexual references, nudity and some frightening scenes."
B00751JL2K This movie was not so good, acting was not so good, loud music throughout the movie could not hear the actors, this movie looked like a B movie so since of realism."
B00751JL2K Poor Christian Slater.  After making his mark in the cult faves PUMP UP THE VOLUME and HEATHERS, his career has been less than meteoric.  His TV series including THE FORGOTTEN and forgotten films like DOLAN'S CADILLAC and LEFT IN DARKNESS bombed on arrival.  In PLAYBACK, he's a perverted lawman with a craving for videos of teen girls undressing.  But this is just a secondary plot in PLAYBACK.  The main focus is on five high-schoolers making a film on a young man who wiped out his family in 1994 before being killed in a police shootout.  And the psycho also videotaped his heinous crime.  Not to mention the infant who survived the massacre.  The students, aided by a weird videographer, recover those violent videos and thus begins our \"RING-like\" catastrophes.PLAYBACK managed to hold my attention---it has some inventive and gory scenes and a predictable twist ending.  Considering the awful dreck out there, PLAYBACK is worth a rental.  And Christian, get a new agent!"
B00751JL2K Playback (Michael A. Nickels, 2012)Playback has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing domestically-released American film of 2012 (it made a grand total of $252, playing on one screen for a single week). It's not the worst film I've ever seen--in fact, it's only the third-worst film I've seen today (and you never know, it might get worse after this!)--but that doesn't mean I would suggest you get within ten feet of a streaming copy of it.We open in 1994, with a young chap named Harlan Diehl (Dogman's Luke Bonczyk) killing his entire family save his sister's baby before being shot by police. Fast-forward fifteen years, and a group of high-school students, working on a project for their journalism class, are investigating the Diehl murders, headed by  Julian Miller (Purgatory House's Johnny Pacar) and his girlfriend Riley (The Master's Ambyr Childers). Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn (Black Swan's Toby Hemingway) to \"acquire\" some information that only the local police have access to; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough--or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case, it would seem--in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks. The problem is, when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes, he finds that Harlan Diehl's legacy extends beyond the grave...If you haven't figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence, you haven't seen enough horror movies. That sort of predictability, unfortunately, plagues this entire production. Once you know all the principal high school students, you should be able to pause the film, sit down, and sketch out a list of who's going to die when. And you know what? You'd probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie. And you have every right to be; Nickles, a character actor (probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne's World 2) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera, does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula. This is depressing, because given some of the angles this movie adopts (it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail, but I will say that my favorite character in the film, Wylie, portrayed by Galaxy Quest's Darryl \"Chill\" Mitchell, is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl's motivations), Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners, kick some sandcastles, what have you. And he took none of them.It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it is an extremely frustrating one, boring, predictable, and full of potential that will forever go unrealized. If you do end up watching it, well, you have my condolences. *"
B00751JL2K But all the necessary parts are there! I looooooove scary creepy movies! I liked the premise of the movie and also that Christian slater was in it(barely) Instead of looking up a more detailed synopsis I went with the tiny blurb> I usually do not look at anything less than 3 stars no 4 stars to be honest> but I have seen recently so many 4 to 4 1/2 that sucked I said lets try a 3! I liked it so much better than I thought! I put my critical mind to sleep and sat back and rolled with it fun ride creepy antagonist and I mean creepy! A twist so surprising I held my hand to my mouth proclaiming \"no way\" I haven't done that since the movie \" the Crying game\" I will definitely watch it again. could give a crap about how horrible of a film an embarrassment! whatever movies are made to entertain us and make us feel different emotions. this film bulls eyed it! if there were better ways to promote it it definitely could have made a profit and a possible sequel. which I think they should maybe they can create a pearl. Its all there figure out how to create it! I think it should become a cult if a bunch of people play it at a Horror party mixed with already seen and not yet! wow could be fun for both parties! sequel sequel Call me its on!!!!!lol thanks I had fun!"
B00751JL2K The movie opens in Oct.21, 1994 in classic horror/slasher style. The killer has an unhealthy \"Ring\" like connection to his TV. He also has a hand held camera to film his killings. The film is grainy, a woman is screaming, there is blood, and a dog is barking. Good horror stuff. By the time it is all over, cops show up and everyone is dead. The opening includes a great leaping stab.In today's time Julian (Johnny Pacar) is making a movie of the event as a class project. He also seeks some stock footage from the local news station. In this horror film we are given the gratuitous nude shots of the young girls as they are being secretly filmed by Quinn (Toby Hemingway) the teen who works at the news station. Quinn in turn sells these thumb drive films to a local admirer (policeman Christian Slater) of the female form. As expected the \"Ring\" aspect we saw earlier enters the film.I liked the discussion of the \"hand-held\" camera technique. The maker of the film claims it gives the movie \"energy\" while the viewer describes it as giving him \"a headache.\" Toby Hemingway plays a good moody psychotic teen. Decent sound track.F-bomb, No sex, Nudity (Jana Veldheer, locker room extras) 4 1/2 STARS"
B00751JL2K Playback is a B-Horror film that in a sense is nothing more than a new take on the Amityville Horror. Instead of a demon possessing a house, the demon in this film, keeps his spirit alive on videotape, and when someone sees the tape, they become the next possessed killer. The story was entertaining but wasn't really anything new or extraordinary and the same can be said about the cast. The cast, led by The Covenant's Toby Hemingway, wasn't one of the most talented casts I've ever seen, but they may have been the best looking. There are some really good looking people in this film, and believe it or not, it helps to keep your attention. The film is a little dull and predictable at times, but there is always something nice to look at. This movie isn't original and won't shock or surprise you, but it may just entertain you for a couple hours and it will most certainly have your eyes glued to the screen."
B00751JL2K \"Now I know the reason he killed his whole family. He was possessed.\" While a group of high school students are making a movie for a class they begin to uncover a dark secret involving the town's past. When one student watches a tape of the event he goes through a change that affects everyone he knows. I have to start by saying that I was surprised with how much I enjoyed and was entertained by this. That said this is just above a B movie. The acting is actually not that bad and the effects are pretty good. The plot of the movie is a cross between \"Mirrors\" and \"The Ring\" and is as entertaining as those were. I really am surprised by how much I enjoyed this, but I had no idea what to expect going in. I know I'm rambling on this one but I really can't explain why I liked this so much but I did and I recommend this. Overall, a surprising movie that is actually one of the better B grade horror movies I have seen lately. I give it a B+"
B00751JL2K i really enjoyed this movie...i watch a lot of horror movies & i thought this had a nice fresh appeal........a little slow in the beggining but it does pick up & it made for a solid good horror movie.....worth checking out !!!"
B0076V8H9C Serial horror with standard horror conventions is a new product for American television and in the last year we have gotten American Horror Story and now the intriguing show The River. The River has an interesting premise that has the potential to last for more than one season even if the first central mystery is solved.Dr. Emmett Cole is the host of a documentary reality show that seems vaguely anthropological in focus. Dr. Cole, his wife, his young son and his staff and crew spent the 1980's and 1990's touring the world in their boat, The Magus and exploring the cultures of the world. The past is shown in flashbacks that add to the story and break the tension in a good way. Every moment of Lincoln's childhood was spent chasing the magic and mystery of the world and before the artfully hidden cameras. Lincoln of course rebelled and his mother and father had the usual marital problems when one partner has obsessions the other partner only partially shares. Thus, Dr. Emmett Cole has taken one last trip into the Amazon alone to seek the magic and sorcery of the indigenous peoples of South America and ultimately spiritual enlightenment. Before this is done his family and friends may wish he had been attracted to a Buddhist monastary. And apparantly he finds that magic and it is all too real as he has disappeared leaving tapes with tantalizing glimpses of the magic he has discovered.Dr. Cole's wife is determined to find him and heal the rift between them, even though both of them have had affairs over the course of their marriage. She pushes her reluctant son Lincoln into accompanying her on the expedition because the network is funding it, but only if every moment of fear, anxiety and family discord can be caught on camera. And of course the long-time crew is just as much a part of the story as the family, especially in light of the fact that Dr. Cole's first companion on the quest is dead and his is the first ghost the party encounters. Filled with standard horror tropes and the magical realism of South America (in one episode a spirit enters one of the characters via a dragonfly) and the drama between the nicely drawn characters. Another episode features an indigenous Stone Age tribe defending their territory. As a tribe recently appeared out of the jungle and started putting arrows in people in real life, this is more than believable.Three episodes in I recommend this to anyone who likes horror, adventure and mystery. I know I will be watching more episodes as they air. Well-written, filmed in an interesting style and incorporating elements not usually seen on American television this is worth investigating."
B0076V8H9C I like the show, its kind of like the \"Invasion\" and \"Lost\" and \"Anaconda\" all in one, kind of,... but hte damn camera cut scenes makes me dizzy, and hard to concentrate on whats happening"
B0076V8H9C After stumbling across the abandoned research center in the previous episode and given the 'fairly certain' teaser that the good doctor was within, this episode kicked off promisingly with an authentic sense of dread and the threat of imminent violence hanging in the air. Unfortunately, once the baddie of the week was revealed, it's unfortunate that I'd just watched The Walking Dead since it seemed the zombies had literally moved from one show to the next. Short of using the word \"Walkers\", they were the same gruesome extras who could only be stopped with a bullet to the head.Character-wise, our German security expert finally revealed his secret - despite the implausibility, it was a welcome diversion. We also didn't have to suffer the captain's daughter providing exposition every time something supernatural happens on the show - she was locked away on the ship so the writers had to find other devices to help out the audience.Still one of my favorite shows of the TV year, this episode ends with an unexpected surprise that indicates the producers aren't going to fall back into weekly program formulas. So let's see where they take it from here."
B0076V8H9C In the primetime TV landscape, the usual program options have become increasingly formulaic, predictable and safe. With more than half of all network dramas being variations on the crime procedural, something that bucks the trend really has the potential to stand out. Even riskier is trying to adapt a horror offering within the strictures of regular TV in an era when audiences seem to clamor for more explicit and graphic thrills (see FX's delightfully loopy and crazed American Horror Story for something that really pushes the boundaries of conventional fare as it has much more freedom on cable). So I commend ABC executives for greenlighting the interesting eight-part experiment by filmmaker Oren Peli (who made a name for himself with Paranormal Activity). He shares the creator credit for this show with Michael R. Perry (he was also a writer on Paranormal Activity 2), a TV veteran who has dabbled in the horror genre before penning episodes of the underrated and short-lived \"American Gothic\" and Chris Carter's \"X Files\" follow-up \"Millennium.\" While not always perfect, therefore, \"The River\" certainly has the distinction of feeling different and that's undeniably a good thing.The idea behind \"The River\" is a good one. Bruce Greenwood plays a popular TV naturist who disappears while on an expedition in the Brazilian wilds. He and his crew are presumed dead. His wife (Leslie Hope) and estranged son (Joe Anderson) put together another documentary crew in an effort to find, and hopefully rescue, the missing men. Trying to piece together what happened through found footage, this new team faces increasingly strange and deadly obstacles the deeper they go. And it becomes abundantly clear that this voyage will have a body count as they seem to be pursuing a location known ominously as the Source. Will it hold the answers they desire? Is Greenwood alive? And will all the random horror elements be pulled together to make sense within a greater plot overview?The Good:Setting: For me, the best thing about \"The River\" is its unusual premise. ABC was so quick to try to brand this the next \"Lost\" that it overlooked that the two shows have very little common ground. The unexplored jungles and the claustrophobic confines of the river boat lend an unusual backdrop to the unfolding drama. Also, it just looks great.Style: While the found footage genre has been a bit overworked since the \"Blair Witch Project\" confirmed its commercial viability, it is effective and different to see it employed in series television. As the horrors are unraveled through quick and random camera shots (either through the crew cameramen or through stationary cameras on the ship), the quick glimpses of danger can make things quite unsettling.The Bad:Poor Research: For a show that takes place in Brazil, someone might have noted that they speak Portuguese there as opposed to Spanish.Ambient Sound: When strange things are happening, the program ramps up the sound effects and music to overwhelming proportions. Call me crazy, but I'd rather the dialogue was louder than the lapping of waves while characters in the river are conversing.The Indifferent:Rushed Beginning: The show takes but a few minutes to establish the characters before setting them adrift. It takes a while before we know anyone, much less care about them, and this lessens the impact of the earlier episodes. Stick around, though, things get better.Horrors: The show aims for creepy more than scary, and that it achieves. Network TV is not a great place for in-your-face monstrosities, and within those limitations, the format does a good job providing some jolts. But our crew experiences such a diverse collection of nightmares, it seems like the creators just wanted to throw everything but the kitchen sink at us and see what stuck. Monsters, possessions, spirits, curses, natives: the mysterious and mystical horrors encompass just about everything you can think of. It's almost too much. And, of course, the mechanic's daughter is the requisite character that seems to know ANYTHING and EVERYTHING about these supernatural occurrences so that they can be \"logically\" explained to the TV audience.Hit or Miss Ending: The 7th episode explains Greenwood's fate, but raises more questions than it answers. The screenplay and the characters are content to let most things go down without much contemplation. I did, however, like the finale's (8th episode) turn of events before the take-it-or-leave-it final scene.I know people that both love \"The River\" and hate it. I can fully understand either position. But taken for what it is, it provides something different on television and that is an invaluable commodity in the land of cookie-cutter TV. At eight episodes, it isn't a huge time commitment and I was pleased enough to go along for the ride. I don't know that ten years from now that I'll be remembering the show as a classic, but for the moment--it was something that I enjoyed and would recommend for the right audience. About 3 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 3/12."
B0076V8H9C This is an interesting storyline set in an intriguing and potentially engaging environment (the Amazon).  The characters lack individual story motivation and seem one dimensional.  What was lacking was a more thorough and realistic integration of the already intriguing elements surfacing in the Amazon jungle and rivers . . . these mysteries alone would have served as the seeds of some incredible plot points.  I wanted this to be so much more than it was.  I would recommend FRINGE and PERSON OF INTEREST or WAREHOUSE 13 as excellent choices for the type of intrigue, character development, and intrigue that cement stories in your imagination."
B007943UZ2 &#34;Religion steals the innocents of the world,.... It comes from history. It comes from the record of the Inquisition, persecuting heretics and torturing Jews and all that sort of stuff; and it comes from the other side, too, from the Protestants burning the Catholics. It comes from the insensate pursuit of innocent and crazy old women, and from the Puritans in America burning and hanging the witches &#8212; and it comes not only from the Christian church but also from the Taliban. Every single religion that has a monotheistic god ends up by persecuting other people and killing them because they don't accept him. Wherever you look in history, you find that. It&#8217;s still going on.&#34;&#8212; Philip Pullman"
B007943UZ2 \"Scientology: The Ex-Files\" is a short Australian documentary from 2010 about the so-called Church of Scientology. The group, which spouts celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta on its roster, is often accused of being a cult.Judging by this program, the accusation is well founded! I admit I wasn't surprised. The breaking up of families, recruitment of teenagers, long working hours, forced abortions and bizarre forms of punishment form the grim reality behind the smiling faade. There is even a kind of internal prison system, known as the RPF or the Rehabilitation Project Force.\"Scientology: The Ex-Files\" features interviews with defectors from Sea Org, the elite corps of Scientology. There is also a suitably embarrassing interview with Tommy Davis, a well-known media spokesperson for the \"Church\". About a year ago, Davis disappeared under mysterious circumstances... Perhaps he ended up in the RPF?There is very little about the message of Scientology in this documentary, neither the public message nor the real message (Xenu and the volcanoes, etc.) Nor does it say much about Hubbard, the founder of this particular pseudo-religion. If you don't know anything about the Scientologists, you might get somewhat confused. It's essentially a documentary focusing on the personal stories of a few victims of the cult.However, since I don't like the \"Church\" of Scientology, I'm going to award \"The Ex-Files\" four stars anyway..."
B007943UZ2 I have always wanted to know what that cult was all about. Now I know. It is very scary and sad to see people getting caught up in that junk instead of focusing on our real God. Very informative."
B007943UZ2 This documentary shows who the real cult of scientology is.  And it sheds light on their scams and lies.  L Ron Hubbard is a fraud."
B007943UZ2 In recent years involvement within the Sea Org has become a focal point within Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard's ideas and ideals came under scrutiny by his own contemporaries. The psychology of indoctrination is a know and has been recognized by historians/professionals in the twentieth century and documented from before the Christian Era. This presentation recognizes and perhaps tries to dispel misinformation while giving the opportunity for more personal accounts of Scientology's practices. If you have read Hubbard's books or know of the principles of Scientology, there is no further information that is included. Dianetics is based on freeing one from trauma in 'past lives' . . . one must remember that Hubbard was a writer of 'pulp fiction'/science fiction. His 'E-meter' certainly falls in line with his books! The Church of Scientology has fallen afoul of multiple global government organizations. The Australian government is featured as such in this video.  What questions need to be answered, the involvement of 'high profile' members, recruitment of members, monies paid to the 'church,' and family relations are all addressed.The interviews and included documentation flow smoothly and are easily followed. An interesting video . . ."
B007943UZ2 I never understood the intricacies of this strange religion but this documentary certainly filled-in some gaps.  No comment on the content, however I will admit that I am amazed that there are so many followers of a very peculiar man and his very unconventional philosophy."
B007943UZ2 this show I don't think even uncovers half or a third of what scientology is all about and it is also scary that some people are actually brained washed into buying all the B.S. that goes with it."
B007943UZ2 2009NR: The fact that three times as many rated this as 'Loved It' (27), as did those who rated it as 'Hated It' (9), speaks, in part, to why organizations like this are so successful. If someone can make a judgement (good or bad) based on a film which lacks both content and conclusion, then they're ripe for the next level of mind-control! Enjoy. MFJLabs 1x"
B007943UZ2 I'm interested in Scientology, having known some members. I don't consider it a religion (far from it), and this video does illustrate that it's better-described as a business -- even a brutal business, given the treatment of some members. If you've read any books about Scientology and have followed reports about it in the press, you aren't likely to learn anything new by watching this, but it was interesting enough that I did stick with it all the way to the end. No big complaints; just not enthusiastic about the informational or entertainment aspects of the video."
B0079W7OCY Our family has always enjoyed Masterpiece mystery and the various characters they bring to life.  Inspector Lewis is one of my favorites, besides all the Agatha Christie characters.  I find it interesting that the stories take place in Oxford, a part of England I'm not familiar with."
B0079W7OCY I'm a fan of this show's predecessor, \"Inspector Morse,\" and I like the \"Inspector Lewis\" series even better.Morse was an eccentric, well-educated, sometimes difficult hero, with DS Lewis as an amiable assistant.  Sometimes, Morse's personality quirks got in the way of the plot and my enjoyment of the series.In \"Inspector Lewis,\" I see similar chemistry. Lewis' assistant, DS Hathaway is the more educated of the two.  He brings added cultural, historical, and spiritual views and a quirky personality to the show. He's endearing in his perceptions and his occasional, youthful awkwardness.Lewis remains the lovable DI with the experience and the insights of a successful career, without becoming the curmudgeon that Morse sometimes seemed.  DI Lewis has retained much of his youthful exuberance and idealism.In this series, I appreciate the increasingly artistic views of Oxford and vicinity.  The chemistry among the characters seems richer and less distracting than in the first few seasons of Inspector Morse.The plots are more cohesively woven than the Morse series.  Some stories' implications are very dark and troubling, but offset by the next few episodes that treat social issues more lightly. (I like \"cozy\" mysteries, and started watching \"Inspector Morse\" and \"Inspector Lewis\" after enjoying shows like Midsomer Murders, Rosemary & Thyme, Poirot, and some Miss Marple series.)All in all, \"Inspector Lewis\" is a series I keep going back to.  I rewatch most episodes two or three times, and I feel that Laurence Fox's character -- and the depth of his acting skills -- lend a subtlety that makes this series more entertaining than some of the \"Inspector Morse\" episodes.  (I feel like a heretic saying that, but there it is.)On visual aesthetics alone, this show would earn my loyalty.  The added delight of interesting characters and compelling story lines makes this a five-star winner for me."
B0079W7OCY When I first started to watch, I did not realize it was a series continuing from Inspector Morse. Inspector Morse was so awesome, I hated to see it end. I wish Amazon would pice up all the series and the series which is a prequel showing how Morse started his career. These have such great casts and intelligence. Most enjoyable. Again, I wish all episodes were available at a reasonable rate. Fortunately, belonging to Prime has helped the cost."
B0079W7OCY This is a well written, acted, and interesting sequel to the PBS series &#34;Morse&#34;, using the support characters as the new lead Characters.  Not often does a sequel work so well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES."
B0079W7OCY After a hectic and challenging day,  there is nothing more pleasant and soothing than sitting down to watch an episode of Inspector Lewis.  It's Oxford porn - all that greenery and prettiness,  all those beautiful homes and cultured silly people committing complex crimes. I live in a very urban city and all that countryside and ancient buildings -it's just so visually beautiful.  I like mysteries - the guarantee of a solution within the show,  complexities answered,  everyone now ready for bed.  But I particularly like this show, which is neither too fast paced or too slow.  I love the interactions between the more working class Lewis and the priestly Hathaway, as well as the rest of the team (though surely Lewis can start dating one day soon...) Anyways this is the first of the series,  I have watched all of them and frequently rewatched them too.  It's a soothing pleasure."
B0079W7OCY Light fair.  Lewis has matured and is a better officer.  Hathaway a good fit.  No gratuitous violence, less abusive language, soft undercurrents, and some lighthearted banter to get us thru.  A winner for mystery."
B0079W7OCY My husband and I always watched Inspector Morse, and, of course Lewis was in them so we came to really like him.  I really like Hathaway, he is a good foil for Lewis and very well educated, so he is different and interesting.  The Oxford settings are great, I enjoy the scenery and the people depicted.  Keep it going, I watch on my Fire HD.Bev. McGraw"
B0079W7OCY Mystery is interesting, characters interesting, scenery is fascinating. How the mystery is solved with brain power, no guns, no physical fights, and just enough technology to be real makes this a great series. Each and every episode was well worth watching."
B0079W7OCY Having just returned from a summer class at Oxford, I felt transported back by this episode of Inspector Lewis. Good story, good  performances by both the main characters and the supporting cast, and of course wonderful scenery all combined to make this a 5 star episode."
B0079W7OCY for those of you who are just starting out with either morse or lewis, you need to understand what a juggernaut of UK tv this has become involving novels and now THREE successful mystery series.  it all started with the Morse novels written by colin dexter.  i have read all of them and they are all excellent. the first tv series was made from these novels and was excellent as well.  then tv decided to keep going even though there were no more novels to use.  the first spin off was this series, LEWIS, based on Morse's sidekick in all of the novels and the first tv series.  he was given a brainy sidekick who could understand the eggheads at oxford, just like morse did.  this series was a big hit as well. perhaps the biggest surprise though was the most recent series, ENDEAVOUR, which covers Morse as he starts out his career in the police in the 1960s.  This series is utterly fabulous and the names comes from morse's hated first name.the attraction of all three of the series begins with setting murders in Oxford England, right in the midst of Oxford University.  the intellectuals of course dominate at Oxford and their alumni are the big people in the Uk.  its only true rival is cambridge. the police are unwelcome outsiders.  lewis exemplifies being an outsider as he never went to university, much less oxford.  morse did go to Oxford but did not finish. he was bright enough but a love affair gone bad derailed him. at that point he joined the police.  everyone at oxford looks down on them as the police, thinking they are simpletons, but they can compel cooperation if not respect while solving cases. this premise has fueled all three series.this was the order i have done all the books and tv: the Morse tv series, the Morse novels, the Endeavour tv series and last the Lewis tv series.  this worked for me but if you are an ardent reader it might be better to start with the Morse novels by colin dexter.o highly recommend all of these series and books."
B0079W7OCY I became a devoted fan of Inspector Morse from the start of watching that series.  Morse is not the easiest character to admire, as he seems chronically depressed, with occasional respite from despair in his enjoyment of classical music.  So when the Morse series ended, I was compelled to become involved in the continuation of the stories with Inspector Lewis.  Both series are well conceived, produced, and acted.  In my opinion the British are very skilled in their production of such series, especially with the crime and mystery genre.  Their writers have mastered the skill of putting together characters, plot and setting to keep the viewer continually  entertained and mentally engaged.Thanks to Amazon.com and my ROKU device I have these episodes available to me at my convenience.  I so appreciate that."
B0079W7OCY I am addicted to this series, possibly because I find Kevin Whatley's character so appealing as he interacts with his scholarly counterpart to solve intriguing crimes.  The academic atmosphere of the setting alone is enough to hold the viewer's attention and acts as a character in the plot.  A nice mixture of crime drama and subtle humor."
B0079W7OCY It is a great show, I love the Brits and this is about 2 officers relationship, a younger guy who amazes the older copper as they call themselves. They solves murders together and have only their wits to do it"
B0079W7OCY This is a great mystery series produced by the BBC highlighting the work of Inspector Lewis who is a good working class detective working in an intellectual community.  He does not relate well with the people around him both in the community and even, to an extent, his coworkers and supervisor.  They fight him at times but respect him for his doggedness and success.  This is well worth watching if you enjoy British mystery stories.  Think of a British version of &#34;Law & Order&#34; but without the courtroom portion."
B0079W7OCY great series, while I cant watch them too close together (becomes a bit tedious) I love the characters...well worth the $$ (bought these on Amazon instant video)"
B0079W7OCY Wonderful series.  Morse was exceptional and Lewisfollows in the same manner.  English drama has class.No excessive blood and guts, and only innuendo onvarying topics.  Refreshing!"
B0079W7OCY Setting and casting perfect for story line.  Series of 29 episodes so far all hold you attention. Good for end of tiring day.  Nice to watch- no commercials."
B0079W7OCY again the inspector lewis mysteries are exceptionally well written and well acted and the development of the characters and the stars keep me entertained and so much so I purchased the sequels only available through purchase"
B0079W7OCY I enjoy each visit to Oxford trekking through a mystery with great actors and wonderfully written scripts.  The ambiance of each episode is delightful and beautiful.  I feel like I spend time in England with each show.  Whatland and Fox are the perfect team.  Their characters complement one another to perfection and the rest of the cast is superb, as well.  As each series ends, I eagerly look forward to the next one."
B0079W7OCY I love all of the Inspector Lewis episodes because they make you use the little gray cells between your ears.  I loved him with Inspector Morse and I love him more with his latest tall,educated,elusive sidekick and the ongoing relationship with the blond ME.  The characters continue to evolve and are becoming more complex.  Hope Amazon can get more like these for Prime viewing.  I am totally addicted to these crime, mystery, type programs.  Give us more!"
B0079W7OCY I like the interaction between Inspector Lewis and his partner.  Lewis is a street smart detective who trusts his &#34;gut feelings&#34;.  His partner is an Oxford educated new detective.  Between the two of them, they get the job done."
B0079W7OCY I love to watch Detective movies and nobody does it as well as the British and Norwegians. There is a compelling story, with a who-dun-it twist at the end. You are as baffled as the detectives work out the mystery. And detective story telling at it&#8217;s finest."
B0079W7OCY My wife and I have been enjoying British serials and were looking for a new to us program after finishing seasons of Downton Abbey and Sherlock Holmes. Inspector Lewis is a bit low key, I suspect we need to watch a few episodes before we are taken in with the characters, but so far so good."
B0079W7OCY I didn't like the Inspector Morse program, but I am really enjoying the Inspector Lewis series.  The writing comes off as more authentic, if that makes any sense.  It really is good quality  television for an evening."
B0079W7OCY Great stories that keep you guessing as to who was the murderer. The two actors, Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox do a great job and their interaction is excellent"
B0079W7OCY Each episode has a different writer so some episodes are not as well paced as others and some episodes have better actors playing minor parts than others.  Having said this, this is an excellent detective series.  The characters of Inspector Lewis played by Kevin Whately, and Inspector Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox, are nicely balanced and play off each other well.  Inspector Lewis is a 50 something widower, brash, outspoken and someone who wears his emotions on his sleeve.  He always gets off a great line.  Inspector Hathaway is his 20 something junior partner, a former Cambridge seminarian who plays jazz guitar.  And, then there's Oxford, a historic institution, a place of high academic status, where the ego joustings are always on display.  Altho I don't always catch what is being said, it is still fun and interesting to watch!"
B0079W7OCY Much more likeable than Inspector Morse, the mystery still remains murky and leads Lewis through a labyrinth of twists and turns and the audience with him. I  have enjoyed  the season 1 and  am happily anticipating season 2."
B0079W7OCY I like the way the two detectives work together, and how they complement each other to solve the crimes. Looking forward to the next season."
B0079W7OCY This intelligently written and well-acted series portrays  the love affair with the beauty of Oxford and shows that, with deep appreciation of the classics can exist all the cunning and criminal behavior of any less cultured city. The characters are richly portrayed by those talented Brits. Even the author of the Morse series himself Colin Dexter makes his signature Hitchcockesque appearance giving his approval to the sequel to his series. Morse is dead but sinister behavior, murder and excellent plots survive. And Robbie (Kevin Whately) now an Inspector himself, has found a suitable replacement for Morse in his enigmatic partner played by Laurence Fox."
B0079W7OCY We like the acting and the plots are intriguing, though sometimes rather complicated.  The accents are difficult for us to catch sometimes, but we make do or replay portions.  Entertaining."
B0079W7OCY We enjoyed watching season 1 so much that we added every other season available on prime into our watchlist. So far we have only watched the first episode of season 2, and loved it as well."
B0079W7OCY i did not know i would come to love this series as much as i do. its quite progressive and the characters are very well played"
B0079W7OCY I love his crustiness and that he struggles with modern gadgets.  He has a great relationship with his partner and his boss attempts to keep these two in check with a firm hand.  Great series."
B0079W7OCY I have liked this Inspector Lewis series from the beginning.  It is always interesting, good plot and photography, sound level usually good.  The only tiny negative is that sometimes the supporting actors are mumblers, which can be difficult to keep the conversations understandable.  This is not usually the case, and may not really be relevant to the case.  Overall a 4.90 Stars."
B0079W7OCY The Inspector Lewis series are favorites of ours."
B0079W7OCY mysterv lovers wll enjoy inspector lewis.the acting is good and the scenery beautiful.i love englsh mysteries so inpector lewis is right bup my alley"
B0079W7OCY Laurence Fox is a great actor in any show.  Would watch him in all British television. He and Devin Whately make a great team."
B0079W7OCY It is a very enjoyable series, the inspector is quirky and different. His sidekick helps to keep him in line and on track."
B0079W7OCY I always enjoy the Inspector Lewis movies.  Very good who done it type of mystery.  I would recommend this movie for anyone.  The language in the movie does not have four letter words like the &#8220;F&#8221; word.  When I am watching a movie and it does, I just turn it off.  There is no reason for using that word in any movie. Especially if the whole family is watching the movie."
B0079W7OCY I love these English police shows!  Inspector Lewis and Hathaway are worth the time it takes to watch them.  I get to escape from my hum drum life."
B0079W7OCY I have enjoyed watching this series on Prime.  It is so good to be able to watch these shows on my Kindle or laptop."
B0079W7OCY Loved the intelligence quotient of this program.  Kept me guessing and interested.  Will recommend to others for sure for a good program."
B0079W7OCY I do love a good who dunnit story and this does not disappoint. When you add believable characters, fantastic settings like Oxford University in London, adds a up to a winning combination. My only complaint is not nearly enough episodes. Give me more Inspector Lewis!"
B0079W7OCY Masterpiece Theaters Inspector Lewis series is in my opinion some of the best television ever created. The characters are believable, the villains are often hidden beneath layers of British culture and nearly un-catchable, their crimes are bewildering and often quite unsettling. The Inspector is a British original at once crotchety, and kind but most of all insightful into the inter-workings of criminal minds. His partner is a near opposite who brings culture, education, and youthfulness to the team. All scenes take place surrounded by the beauty of the land and buildings that occupy it. I really like this series and recommend to any fan of British television."
B0079W7OCY I like it because it is slow enough to understand the plot, no guns and pleasant English country side, very polite people."
B0079W7OCY We loved this series on PBS.  Lewis and Hathaway are wonderful characters, well acted with plots have great twists and turns.  On PBS we could turn on closed captioning to catch all the dialog.  Hathaway's asides can be especially difficult to understand.If there was a closed captioning option, this would be a 4 1/2 stars."
B0079W7OCY I really liked Endeavor Morse best.  But because I like the English police crime solvers, I also thoroughly enjoyed Inspector Lewis & his sidekick.  Really fun to watch."
B0079W7OCY I love Inspector Lewis and Hathaway--yes, he is rather dishy.  I actually enjoy this series more than I did Morse.  Lewis is much more approachable and the relationship between the mentoring relationship Lewis has to Hathaway is very well done and believable.My complaint with the streaming version is -- WHERE'S THE PILOT EPISODE????  I really hate coming in partway into the story.  I know the pilot is available on the DVD, so why not on the streaming version?"
B0079W7OCY ...of continuing the legacy of Inspector Morse.  Pairing Lewis with a 'brainiac', (as was Morse), but in the junior position was a stroke of genius in itself. Love the juxtaposition and that it's the everyman who is now leading the intellectual."
B0079W7OCY It has a different feel than many of the shows in this genre. It's kinda refreshing to watch. Good acting."
B0079W7OCY I think that Lewis and Hathaway are very interesting characters, very good team, the super-snobbery of the Dons versus the cops is good, plus the language used is quite delightful!"
B0079W7OCY Being an Anglophile, I loved Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis is continuing the tradition. The plots are interesting and revolve around Oxford and Cambridge - England, that is.I love seeing the town, hearing the wonderful music and meeting the weird academics. English culture and wonderful accents. Just sit back and enjoy - not terribly complicated or thought-provoking but fun."
B0079W7OCY Do not have the words to applaud this series as it should be done.  I have seen this series many times and plan to continue tosee them over and over.  This is from the Inspector Morse series and both have stellar credentials - on all levels.  Story,actors,location, personalities are fantastic.  This may seem like I really like this type of pure perfection offered in this area.  The English countryside offers scenery that is of course, very English and of course, historic as well.  Appreciate the story lines - the complications that are part of story and is as always - memorable.  I go on too much?  Still watch Inspector Morse - really miss hisamazing portrayal of Morse.  See also, the review for Season 2 - that will be addressed and will be a &#34;ditto&#34;."
B0079W7OCY We decided to check out this out and we were not disappointed. It doesn't have a lot of fast paced action if that is what you want. It is just a simple story of detectives solving a crime.  The do seem to make the plot interesting so you don't get too bored. It is kind of funny that we have to go to another countries TV shows to find something decent. There are too many realty shows going nowadays which we do not care to watch."
B0079W7OCY I loved Inspector Morse and somehow the different combo of Lewis and his new Sargent works rather well.  The counter point of the common man versus Oxford is still there.  I have watched all of them with pleasure."
B0079W7OCY love the interactions between characters. Always a good story, never disappointed. Have not seen an episode that was not worth the watch"
B0079W7OCY I was so sad when Insp Morris died. But, I loved Lewis and when they continued on with him, I was in hog heaven. The show has the same depth and intelligence that Morris had, but a bit more modern flare. Lawrence Fox is great."
B0079W7OCY I enjoy the twists and turns each show leads you through. a fun way to spend the time, I love the look you get of the English society"
B0079W7OCY I was not sure that this series would be good but was familiar with Inspector Lewis from the John Thaw series.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well done the shows are with interesting scripts and good acting."
B0079W7OCY John Morse was such a figure in the annuals of Masterpiece Theatre, particularly the Mystery Division. Since his death, DS Lewis his partner has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and  their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox,  who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended.In this series, they deal with altered identities and crimes of retribution. DI Lewis is still having difficulty dealing with his wife's unsolved murder, so this is s 'come to momma' series. DS Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DS Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.DI Lewis and DS Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver!Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-03-13"
B0079W7OCY Great connection between the two main characters, Lewis and Hathaway.  Interesting mystery puzzles/stories.  Beautiful scenery and  lovely music.  This series is a sequel to the Inspector Morse series:  Both are excellent."
B0079W7OCY British mysteries tend to take you to the villages or city life of England and this one is no different. I will probably check out the rest of the mysteries in the series, but I didn't get caught up in the story or the characters. I know, I know, I should. It's British and all and by definition, that means it's far superior to anything we, across the pond, can muster unless it blows up or takes off its clothes or races after something equally high powered in a winner-takes-all-after-destroying-everything contest."
B0079W7OCY Very good series.  I only gave it four stars because it would be hard for any detective show to rate up with Foyle's War.  Well, maybe Endeavor comes in at a close second."
B0079W7OCY I already said what I think about this re Season 2, which came up first in this listing.  I don't remember much about the difference between season 1 and season 2 except that Hathaway's hair gets longer (an improvement), and Lewis himself gets more interesting. Probably, I had seen some episodes of season 2 before I went back and watched season 1."
B0079W7OCY A worthy British murder mystery series to watch if you've got nothing better to watch. There's so much rubbish out there."
B0079W7OCY Very good series, I enjoyed it very much. Sometimes story line was a little to concedental for me. good to watch"
B0079W7OCY Great British mystery series, continuing in the footsteps of Inspector Morse.  Inspector Lewis is an honest, hard-working widower & Sargent Hathaway is his quiet, highly educated, yet humorous, side-kick.  The two doggedly go after the bad guys with determination & lots of legwork.  Taking place in Oxford, the setting provides an interesting assortment of characters, while the perfectly matched duo track down murderers - most of the time, with the disapproval of their boss.  Overall, an entertaining series."
B0079W7OCY I don't like all episodes. As a rule, I like Inspector Lewis very much, but some episodes are uncomfortable for me to watch, so I skip them."
B0079W7OCY I had watched the first episode of Inspector Lewis Season 1 and thought it was okay, but then I watched it a second time and really liked it. I went on to watch the second episode and now I am a fan."
B0079W7OCY I love the story lines in this series. Kevin Whately was in one of characters from the old Miss Marple mysteries as well as co star of Morse series. Always a pleasure to watch him. Lawrence Fox is a perfect fit as Lewis's 2nd. The murder mysteries have breath,  depth & twists & turns. Very intriguing"
B0079W7OCY The acting is very good, the sense is great, but the plot twists are not satisfying. Good, but not great."
B0079W7OCY Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis onInspector Morse - Complete Collectionstars as Detective Inspector Lewis in \"Inspector Lewis\", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes,  I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).In Series One, there are three riveting episodes set in Oxford:Whom the Gods Would Destroy - When an Oxford don's former classmate is found murdered, he comes under suspicion, but Lewis and Hathaway need to tread with care given the sensitive nature of the case.Old School Ties - Lewis is not happy when he is assigned \"babysitting\" duties with Hathaway. The celebrity in need of protecting is a reformed criminal turned celebrity author. When an attractive young student turns up dead, there are many suspects to choose from - her circle of college mates who all seem to be rather ambivalent in their feelings toward the girl, and also the celebrity himself. When the celebrity himself ends up murdered, Lewis' past comes back in the attractive form of his ex-schoolmate and ex-girlfriend, who turns out to be the widower/ agent of the dead man.Expiation - An apparent suicide of a North Oxford housewife perplexes Lewis. There was no suicide note, and the dead woman's life seemed too perfect to be true. Lewis and Hathaway dig deeper to get at the truth.I have become a fan of Inspector Lewis and his devoted sergeant Hathaway. Lewis may not be Morse, but this series is charming in its own right - there's a high sense of atmosphere, and the scenic Oxford setting makes it a series of high aesthetic value. The cinematography and score are beautifully done. The plots are not as intricate as those in the Morse series, but I love the wonderful chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway, not to mention the lovely pathologist Hobson. I have watched up to Season 4, and am looking forward to future seasons."
B0079W7X98 I've really enjoyed this series and especially this season, seeing the characters develop. I was only so-so about the Inspector Morse series that preceded it.  Morse was just a little too much of a curmudgeon for me to warm to.  I suppose he was engaging, in his own way, but that series lacked the depth of the Inspector Lewis series that followed.&#34;Inspector Lewis&#34; carries on with the best elements of Inspector Morse stories, and Lawrence Fox's character brings a sweeter wit that takes the edge off many features he shares with the Inspector Morse character.  Fox's character's additional introspection is especially brilliant.The stories sometimes edged into such lurid areas, I was repulsed.  But, of course, crime should be repulsive.  That's where crime-related TV shows have to walk a fine line between entertainment and integrity.Some episodes in this series (not just Season 2) were better than others.  However, the way the story concluded in 2013.. that was tremendous.  I was astonished when I read that a 2014 series was planned. I'm eager to see how they'll bring the cast back together, and if the show will continue its tradition of rich, challenging mysteries investigated by a bright, interesting team.Inspector Morse (with Lewis as his assistant) was endearing.Inspector Lewis (with Hathaway as his assistant) is charming and far more engaging on many levels.  The writing, visual structure, and acting make this an exceptionally good series."
B0079W7X98 I love Inspector Morse. This is a series starring the DI who served under him. Wonderful! If you like British detective series, you will love this one. Great intelligence."
B0079W7X98 I would rather have given it a 3-1/2 but... it just is not inspector Morse, and I am sorry, but Inspector Lewis just cannot seem to carry it off by himself. He is not a big enough character in my opinion, and I was disappointed. There also lacks the acidic humour lnspector Morse spread, however thinly."
B0079W7X98 There is always a surprising twist at the end of the stories and when the guilty person is revealed to the viewer."
B0079W7X98 Wasn't sure if I would enjoy it as much as Morse but it is better. Stories are consistently good and I enjoy his sidekick too."
B0079W7X98 Another winner from the UK.  We'll thought out, easy to watch and the kids can come and go without fear of learning questionable words, or nightmares."
B0079W7X98 I do love these characters. If I could just learn to turn them off at night and go to bed!!"
B0079W7X98 I pretty much like all the Masterpiece Mysteries.  That said, if this isn't your thing at present, I'd say give it a chance and expand your horizons."
B0079W7X98 The show would have been better if it were only one hour.  It drags out to fill the time slot and I lose interest."
B0079W7X98 I find Inspector Lewis and Sgt. Hathaway are a good match, and work well together.  The University setting is great for Angliophiles like me and the mysteries keep you guessing."
B0079W7X98 This is a very interesting program.  It is a continuation of Inspector Morse,  The format is great.  It holds your interest throughout the program and is another good British mystery,"
B0079W7X98 I watched all of the Morse episodes , then moved quickly to watch Inspector Lewis.  I enjoyed them all.  British quality shows in the production of these entertaining shows.  I especially enjoy  the scenic shots in and around London and  Oxford.The character development in these stories is superb, and the acting effective.  I shall dread the ending when I have viewed the last one available to me on Amazon.com.  Then I  shall have to start viewing them over again, from the beginning.The story development in this series presents a  more realistic picture of how such crimes are solved, by hard work, astute observation, and concentrated thought over all aspects of the situation and its main players.  Sometimes it helps to have Sergeant James Hathaway and his classical education to analyse clues that Inspector Lewis might miss, due to his unique background.  They are such a perfect match for the job that they perform.I have suffered sort of a shock whenever I switched from a BBC or PBS production to watching a TV series made here in the US, such as Law & Order or the CSI series, due to the abundance of shocking and graphic crime scenes in our American productions.  I notice that the British law enforcement personnel make a point of being so very  polite to every character in the production, even the obvious criminals of the worst kind. The US law enforcement methods are rougher, I suppose to match the more horrendous kinds of crimes that occur here compared to that the British produce for their audiences. Our US law enforcement personnel seem to be portrayed as being more callous, having their feeling very jaded, and oppressive.  It makes me wonder about our American mind set.I wish this series or ones similar could continue for a very long time.  I so appreciate the availability of this quality of TV viewing provided by Amazon.com.  Thanks for  shows that encourage us to actually think and analyze as the story progresses. So much better a strategy than too much noise, too much blood and gore, and the real savagery we see in many US productions about crime and mystery.Thanks again, Amazon.com"
B0079W7X98 In my opinion nobody does mystery and crime better than the British.  Lewis is right up there with the best of them:  Lynley, Havers, Wexler, Morse, Daziel & Pasco, etc, etc. etc.  Lewis and Hathaway are a thoroughly enjoyable and a less acerbic team than were Inspector Morse and the then Sergeant Lewis but the stories are intelligent and almost as twisty as they were in Morse's day.  I enjoy the compassion and humor between Lewis and Hathaway and the two make a good team.  I look forward to every episode and hope the series continues for a long time to come."
B0079W7X98 I love a good murder mystery and this one of the good ones. Please give us more episodes to enjoy!"
B0079W7X98 I love Kevin Whately, don't get me wrong. I remember seeing him as a young actor in the Miss Marple series (the first ones). And of course he was spectacular in Inspector Morse series and in this series as well. But it's the team of Lewis and Hathaway that makes this series so wonderful. Their differences, their banter, and their mutual respect are all delightful."
B0079W7X98 Such a pleasant way to spend time  Intriguing but not normally showing a lot of bloody scenes.  I really enjoy this but I am an Anglophile."
B0079W7X98 Outstanding writing and acting. Every episode kept my attention. I particularly liked how they worked into the main characters' backgrounds throughout the series....couldn't help but come to admire and respect Hathaway, Lewis and Hobson."
B0079W7X98 The series is a set of great murder mysteries solved by a Detective who comes from a working class neighborhood where he learned his trade.  He is obviously out of his comfort zone living and working in the world of the privileged and intelligentsia.  His partner has significantly greater education and the two rub raw sometimes but they also compliment each other and together do a great job of solving the impossible cases, at the same time entertaining us very well."
B0079W7X98 Excellent!  Morse through Lewis.  Just the best!  Would watch them all over again.  Real acting with no blood and guts."
B0079W7X98 Very enjoyable.  Wish there were more episodes. we use rokau streaming video- works great (no commercials- wonderful).  Incredible scenery old England!"
B0079W7X98 well written and I enjoy the storyline and the cast and especially the layout of the story as the mystery unfolds and is not revealed until the ending /I  appreciate the mystery is the focus and the cast is explored as aside to the show"
B0079W7X98 It is fun to watch the non intellectual  Inspector Lewis solve the crimes taking place in the Intellectual community of Oxford.Many of the the Oxford community are quite condescending until Inspector Lewis solves the crime."
B0079W7X98 I have always enjoyed the Inspector Lewis series.  The mysteries are interesting and the acting is very good.  I highly recommend this show."
B0079W7X98 This is a fair program but it was not my very favorite."
B0079W7X98 Once again this is a fourth time watching this series and hope there are more. Lewis is not at all abusive to DS Hathaway. Love the subtle humor of Hathaway. Great team. Want more seasons of inspector Lewis. Really wish amazon would have more BBC mysteries, even old ones, available on live streaming. If you haven't watched Hest in the Sun it is now available. Watch it, you'll like it."
B0079W7X98 Kudos to everyone involved in this series.  I never thought I would enjoy a series as I did the &#34;Inspector Morse&#34; series.  This Inspector Lewis series exceeded my expectations."
B0079W7X98 Well written and well acted. Have viewed several seasons of this series and have enjoyed them all. Well done and engrossing"
B0079W7X98 The stories are well conceived and well written.  The characters are interesting, appealing and well acted.  There seems to be a fundamental difference between detective stories produced in England and those in the US.  I think the characters are more restrained in the English productions."
B0079W7X98 Love Kevin Whately and his co-star.  They are great together.  The mysteries are interesting and challenging to the mind."
B0079W7X98 I realize that I enjoy this series more than the series with Inspector Morse, who was crotchety and irritable most of the time. Lewis is a likeable fellow and the mysteries are at least as well plotted as those starring Morse.  I was a Morse fan but I confess that Lewis is not only as good, but to my mind bertter and seldom abrasive. Of the two, I'd choose Inspector Lewis."
B0079W7X98 Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are. Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are.Can't say enough about how good the Inspector Lewis mysteries are"
B0079W7X98 Like its predecessor, Inspector Morse, you have to watch this carefully because of the rich complexity of the stories and characters. If you like mysteries, you'll love this."
B0079W7X98 This series is very well done with interesting, likable main characters.  I very much look forward to spending time with them."
B0079W7X98 Brilliant series, superb acting. not only by leads but as guest players. They have probably all done Shakespeare, etc. They make run-of-the-mill US actor look like a bunch of amateurs. Very well plotted."
B0079W7X98 The plots, acting and the views of England make Inspector Lewis a must watch for British mystery lovers.  When finished watching buy the Morse series books and enjoy."
B0079W7X98 Really enjoyed this series. The cast and the stories were great. Will go and find the original Inspector Morse  series so I can see inspector Lewis' early days."
B0079W7X98 Great show, a bit convoluted at times but generally good programs. It's worth watching if you have not seen it."
B0079W7X98 i love english mysteries. the plots areinteresting and the actin is good. if you like mysteries you will enjjoy the inpector lewis series"
B0079W7X98 I like crime stories but I love the British crime stories especially.  There are no really overplayed action parts with guns and 40 people shooting each other.  This is more sleuthing and detective work.  I have watched all 6 seasons of Inspector Lewis and I enjoyed every one."
B0079W7X98 I have grown to love this series for several reasons. Primarily, it is not full of gratuitous violence and senseless action. Secondly, it has many of the qualities of the famous British &#34;cozy&#34; mystery. Although the body count is not trivial in amount, very little pandering to the &#34;lookie-loo&#34; nature of the typical human is allowed."
B0079W7X98 The ensemble interaction is first rate.  The stories are well thought out.  Lewis and Hathaway were meant for each other."
B0079W7X98 I love Laurence Fox.  Saw him act in another series.  Could watch him in anything. I love  British television so much."
B0079W7X98 This is a very good &#34;Who Don It&#34; movies.  I enjoyed each movie in the Season 2 series.  Most of all it is good for the whole family.  There are no four letter words in this series.  I believe you will enjoy each movie"
B0079W7X98 I really like English shows.  This spin off from Morse is a hit.  I really enjoy every part of each series."
B0079W7X98 The writers of the series keep me coming back for more.  I like the fact that it doesn't appear formulaic, other than the fact the Lewis and Hathaway always get their man (or woman).  Occasionally, the pair set a snooty Oxford nose straight.  Having visited Oxford only once, I enjoy seeing more than a tour bus could offer:)"
B0079W7X98 If you're a fan of the Inspector Lewis series and you like the Character of his side-kick, James Hathaway, make sure to watch the \"Born of Fire\" Episode.It explains why James left his religious studies at the Seminary.  In this episode he mourns the life of an old friend, he over drinks, he pays the guitar and goes clubbing  he lies to and has a big row with Lewis, and he opens up to a woman.You really get to see James Hathaway growth and progression over a long period of time. I've seen alot of episodes from this series and this one is still my favorite."
B0079W7X98 I love the whole Morse series I would recommend Lewis with his sharp instincts and his ex-seminarian partner to anyone."
B0079W7X98 I love British television. Inspector Lewis, and Sgt Hathaway, are two of the best characters I have seen.  With each new season they have become more and more real, like two friends I want to hear how their day went.  Kevin Whately has done a wonderful job of growing his character from sidekick to star; a leader with a disarming folksy charm.  The bad guys just don't see him coming because they don't think he is a threat.  Laurence Fox plays Hathaway like you would expect some one to play a valuable violin; every note is perfect.  In each episode Hathaway is revealed in a slightly different way, but it feels like you are just gradually getting to know him.  Great characters.  Great stories.  This one makes me want to beg for more."
B0079W7X98 The show is just developing.  Its a police show that is enjoyable to watch without a lot of gore.  Inspector Lewis and his partner get along very well and its fun to watch the two of them work together."
B0079W7X98 Interesting series from the point of view of an outsider at Oxford...not accepted in the higher education snobbery of Oxford. Both the Inspector and his partner have multi level intriguing character and it is more than just solving the murders. Love it!"
B0079W7X98 Good and old fashion movie series, no guns and minimal violence.Modern day Agatha Cristy.However it's in Oxford, and if there were so many murders in Oxford, no one would go there to study!!!!"
B0079W7X98 I just love these British mysteries.  The plot is very interesting and many times I am surprises with who done it!  The main characters are human and interesting."
B0079W7X98 I love the entire series and actually came over from Netflix to Amazon to watch  Seasons 4, 5, and 6. Now that I have seen each episode twice, I have to say that Season 2 is truly my favorite of all. Each episode is so well written, charming and erudite, I could watch it over again, and probably will."
B0079W7X98 Great writing - story plots are really exciting.  I have become a fan.  I will watch them all for sure."
B0079W7X98 My  favorite was Inspector Morse, but now it's Inspector Lewis.  I look forward to another season andhope he doesn't retire."
B0079W7X98 Love this series.  Smart, Sharp, edgy, and cerebral.  The two leads are outstanding, I am looking at all episodes again."
B0079W7X98 Good writers, good actors, interesting plot lines. What more can you ask for. I look forward to watching the next season."
B0079W7X98 I throughly enjoyed Season 2, As I watched I could see the characters build into more believable people, and Oxford what a great setting!"
B0079W7X98 Love Oxford and all the characters, especially Lewis. I suffer from Anglophileness. Plots are fun and interesting. The way that culture and the classics are woven into the plot is a special treat. Music is wonderful."
B0079W7X98 Mystery with intellectual conversation. Is this on tv? Yes it is and I miss it terribly. I am stuck in the SE corner of KS with no tv. It costs a fortune. You have to pay for all and any commercial tv. This is the one series that is on Prime so I watch. The library system in CO offers it also (free). Unfortunately, I have already watched most of them. I am finding that they are just as entertaining the second time around. I am on a limited income. The rental for tv programs that I would also like to watch is very prohibitive,"
B0079W7X98 Review of Season 1 - after you see that - you will look forward to Season 2.  Will not repeat - but will state that there is not a single letdown in the 2nd season.  Enjoy!!!!"
B0079W7X98 Unusual and colorful characters. Love the change from the usual detective series from the U.S. Very addicting. Would recommend to all."
B0079W7X98 Lewis and Hathaway make a wonderful duo.  I really enjoy watching them work.  I don't really care for Innocent because she is too interested in pleasing the higher ups than really letting Lewis solve crimes."
B0079W7X98 I love English detective shows!  Gives an insight into how the English live.  Most of Detective Lewis' episodes occur right on the campus of Oxford University. So enlightening!"
B0079W7X98 Lewis continues the legacy of Inspector Morse. If intelligent,clever mysteries that rely on great writing and not violence is your cup of tea,then Lewis will fill the need. Fox as Sgt. Hathaway is excellent."
B0079W7X98 Continues the great stories of season one.  Same beautiful music and scenery.  And once again Hathaway and Lewis are great together."
B0079W7X98 I watched Kevin Whately in inspector Morris and I loved the way he balanced the sometimes darker and depressed Morris.  He is down to earth and figures things out just as well as the overly cerebral partners."
B0079W7X98 As with most series, you have to watch enough episodes to get to know the star characters before you get hooked. As the characters progress as the series goes along, making them more interesting and human.I give this series 5 stars even though I find it a little bit hard to follow sometimes and the accents are at times hard for a southern boy like me to understand. But I always get the gist of it and move along. 5 STARS"
B0079W7X98 When these first came out, I couldn't get interested because they weren't as good as *Morse*, but I came back to them later and realized the writing has a lot of the qualities that made me like *Morse*. I also like the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway, and even the developing relationship with the ME."
B0079W7X98 More Lewis & Hathaway!  One of my favorite series!  Clearly, an awesome British series, following in the footsteps of Inspector Morse.I love the dialog between Inspector Lewis, a simple, school-of-hard-knocks man and Sergeant Hathaway, the highly intelligent, Cambridge educated, younger partner.  The duo work very well together, in spite of being reined-in constantly by their Captain.  The stories take place in the famous Oxford area & provide a fascinating look into this elite society & its inhabitants - proving that wealth & social status are not always an advantage.  Overall, a wonderful & entertaining series."
B0079W7X98 I really like all of the programs in this series but watch &#34;And the Moonbeams Kissed the Sea&#34; and &#34;The Quality of Mercy&#34; are my favorites. In other series there are episodes here and there that I just don't watch."
B0079W7X98 I am addicted to Brit police type of series.They do it well!!!This series plays well off the quirks of the main characters.Keep em ' coming!!"
B0079W7X98 Lewis and Hathaway are very good and good together.  Excellent murder mysteries without being too graphic and gruesom.Can be guessed but not very easily."
B0079W7X98 Inspector Lewis is wonderful!  Morse would be proud to see how Lewis carried on after his untimely demise.  Three cheers."
B0079W7X98 I really enjoy watching Inspector Lewis. The characters are very good, and the interaction between Inspector Lewis and Sergeant Hathaway is excellent."
B0079W7X98 My husband and I are always trying to see if we can figure out the mystery or &#34;who did it&#34;  before the end. Rarely we can. Sometimes slow but well worth the mystery, clues, and good acting."
B0079W7X98 I OWN THIS WHOLE SERIES ON DVD AND HAVE SEEN EACH EPISODE AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR (ON PBS, MY DVDS AND ON AMAZON PRIME. THIS IS ONE OF THE CLASSIC GEMS IN BRITISH MURDER MYSTERIES AND NEVER GROW OLD. I CONSIDER FOYLE'S WAR AS THE PREMIER MYSTERY, THEN LEWIS , ENDEAVOUR, INSPECTOR MORSE AND NEW TRICKS.YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY ANY OF THESE SERIES."
B0079W7X98 I like  Inspector lewis a lot much better than &#34; Morse&#34;  Morse was very sarcastic.  Lewis's side kick, is smart, which I enjoy.  Hope there are more seasons on Prime. All of the British  detective series are great.  Keep them coming...."
B0079W7X98 Great stories with out the glitz, good story line. An interesting view of looking into a crime through reasoning. Watch it !"
B0079W7X98 There are a whole lot of Brtitish who-dunnits I enjoy, but this has been one I've consistently liked.  Season 2 is right up there with the others."
B0079W7X98 Great series, wonderful acting and story line plus the great music used in each episode.  Sometime just listen to the music in some other shows, it is usually to loud, to simple, so ugly.  Not so here.."
B0079W7X98 Note: Amazon first made Series 3&4 available via streaming (free for Prime members) several months ago, and another fan of the series made it known to me that Series One and Two are now available via streaming (free for Prime members).Kevin Whately, the consummate actor who portrayed Chief Inspector Morse's (John Thaw) long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis on \"Inspector Morse\", is now Detective Inspector Lewis in \"Inspector Lewis\", a high quality investigative drama set in the academic town of Oxford, England.Having watched all of the Inspector Morse episodes, I can see the evolution of Lewis' character (brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Whately) from a diligent albeit lowly sergeant under the guidance of the amazing Chief Inspector Morse (John Thaw) to a confident, outspoken, yet still down to earth DI who now has his own underling in the form of the intellectual, gifted DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox).Season 2 of Inspector Lewis is quite an engaging series, containing many interesting episodes featuring DI Lewis (Kevin Whately) and DS Hathaway (Lawrence Fox). Part of what makes Insp. Lewis a charming series for me is the banter between Lewis and the more cerebral, Cambridge-educated (in theology), Hathaway. There's lots to satisfy the discerning viewer in Season 2 - picturesque Oxford, literary references, and riveting plots, not to mention the excellent ensemble cast.Season 2 contains the following episodes:And The Moonbeams Kiss the Sea - One of my favorites of all the Lewis episodes. This is not only well-written, but is also atmospheric. Lewis and Hathaway try to discover the link between two murders. One is of a maintenance worker at Oxford's Bodleain Library, and the other is of a popular art student. As they dig deeper, they find out that the two deaths are related to some high level forgery involving works of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Oxford dons addicted to gambling.Music to Die For - Whilst investigating the murder of an elderly gay lecturer, Lewis finds connections to the world of underground amateur boxing, the East German Secret Police (Stasi), and even Lewis' old mentor Morse. Poor Lewis gets sort of entangled with a beautiful German, but are her motives purely romantic?Life Born of Fire - The death of a gay student, gay bashing, and college politics get to Hathaway since the dead student also happened to be Hathaway's friend and former classmate. There are some truly strange twists in this one.The Great and the Good - An intriguing episode. A young girl Beatrice is found drugged and a victim of rape, and evidence points to a certain Oswald Cooper, who himself ends up garrotted and castrated. The question is: who is the killer and what is the motive?Allegory of Love - A mysterious young woman is found killed, the weapon being an antique Persian mirror. This resembles a scene found in a historical novel written by up and coming Oxford author, Dorian Crane. Then another young woman is threatened, leading Lewis and Hathaway on a desperate search for the truth.The Quality of Mercy - death and Shakespeare meet when the actor playing the role of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice is found murdered. When another murder occurs, Lewis and Hathaway find their hands full as the list of suspects gets longer.The Point of Vanishing - Curious case of a man killed in his own bathtub.I'd recommend the Inspector Lewis series to any fan of quality British crime procedurals."
B0079XCKAE They way she treats people in this season is deplorable. I am only half-way through but I hope she gets what she deserves.She is DISGUSTING."
B0079XCKAE I enjoyed this very much.  I was pleasantly surprised that they did men vs. women.  It will be interesting to see if they do it again or if they have something else in mind."
B0079XCKAE It starts out slow but the characters become more interesting and likeable. Tarzan boiling his undies in the community pot is classic and worth watching the whole season."
B0079XCKAE Throughly enjoyed it. Survivor always provides fun for anyone of any age and the rewards given can be cultural and provide learning for us."
B0079XCKAE I hate the fact that you tees me with a few shows but dont let me see the rest even though they are on my prime list, you gave a me 3 season but you have all 25 there why are you charging for the rest? sucks"
B0079XCKAE Kim Spradlin is the best alpha female to ever play the game. She tells half truths and plays mind games with a lot of people. This season consist of a really dumb group of girls and a really dumb group of guys living on one beach, but in separate tribes. There are a few stand outs like Kim and Sabrina, but most of the people are either dumb like Kat or crazy like Colton. Colton is a gay student from the south and should be accepting of all people. This is not the case because Colton hates African Americans and hates poor people. In his own way he is a huge bigot except against gay people. In the reunion show Jeff Probst announces that Colton will not play in another season of Survivor because of how offensive he was. This was probably the most frustrating season to watch because a tribe gives up an immunity idol and goes to tribal council. In a game about numbers that was the dumbest thing I've seen in Survivor. Buy this season if you like to see women conquer men."
B0079XCKAE An average season if survivor. After seasons with all returning players it's hard to watch newbies thinking they have slick tricks."
B0079XCKAE I love Survivor series.Can;t wait to get Quatamala, it is the only one I do not have. I own all but that one. I have paid for it but it is a preorder item and still has not shipped."
B007A1DSQ0 i am always drawn to these alternate reality shows, hoping i will find a new X Files or Fringe.  This looks as if it may deliver but in a wholly different way.  A police detective, played by the always wonderful Jason Isaacs of both UK and USA tv roles, is in a car collision.  However, there are two versions of the aftermath.  In one his son survives but not his wife and in the other vice versa.  In both alternatives, he has a shrink. They have a lot of theories for why he is dreaming another reality. However, our hero is not sure one of them is a dream.  This is because what he does in one reality, impacts on his solving cases in the other reality,  If one were a dream, there should be no such effect. of course, i hope this whole premise doesn't become a vehicle for crime solving so that the show's chief emphasis becomes being a cop show,  that would be a waste of some awfully promising material.  give it a try."
B007A1DSQ0 I enjoyed this complex mystery when it was on and hoped to find more clues when watching it without comercials."
B007A1DSQ0 Until the final frames of this season thriller, I had no idea which \"reality\" was true. At some point, I began to have my doubts that either were real. This was just a well-crafted series. I'm sorry to see that it was only a one-season show, but really, where would you go from the final episode? Unless..."
B007A1DSQ0 A thoughtful and highly original tv series. Great acting, first rate stories.  Accept the highly unusual premise and enjoy it.  Jason Isaacs is a unique and appealing star.  Since it's so good it will undoubtedly be cancelled, so watch it now while you can."
B007A1DSQ0 \"Awake\" is one of those rare TV shows that is simultaneously entertaining and engaging. The only recent shows I can think of that gave us a similar combination of action and intelligent viewing are \"Fringe\", \"Numbers\", and \"Life on Mars\".\"Awake\" centers on alternate realities (as \"Fringe\" did from a very different perspective). In this case, a detective (Jason Isaacs) is involved in a car accident, and when he awakes he learns that his wife (Laura Allen) has been killed and his son (Dylan Minette) has survived. But that night when he goes to sleep again, he wakes up in an alternate reality, where his wife survived and his son was killed. Both realities seem equally valid.To further complicate matters, events (and people) in the alternate reality often provide clues to happenings in the other universe, which radically improves Isaac's clearance record but baffles his partners when he comes up with clues and solutions that are incomprehensible. This basic theme gives us our weekly episodic drama, but the continuing drama is what really happened the night of the accident. Was it really an accident? Or was his \"accident\" an attempt on his life by people involved in a criminal conspiracy that keeps coming back in more and more suppressed memories.The acting is great. Liverpool born Jason Isaacs is best known for his work as a villain in films like \"Harry Potter\" (as Lucius Malfoy) and \"The Patriot\" (as the brutal English Colonel). He's not your normal hero but this is not your normal TV show. Steve Harris plays his old partner. Very round and very black, Harris is best known from his work in \"The Practice\" and \"Homicide: Life on the Street\". Other notable performers include Cherry Jones (the President from \"24\") as a shrink, Laura Innes (Dr Weaver from \"ER\") as Isaacs's captain, and Kevin Weisman (the computer geek from \"Alias\") as a detective who keeps popping up.The series was created by Kyle Killen who is best known for the \"Lone Star\" (2010) series.Unfortunately \"Awake\" was too challenging for most viewers and suffered from low ratings, averaging only 2 million+ viewers each week which isn't sustainable in prime time TV where reality shows produce 4 or 5 times that number.BTW - each episode gets better and better, so don't be concerned if the first few episodes don't reach out and grab you by the throat. Week by week \"Awake\" will slowly capture you and the last 2 episodes are examples of TV at its very best.Bottom line - if you're looking for an intelligent, challenging script that is entertaining and engaging, this one is for you.FWIW - I had my own ending for the season, which differs substantially from the one we see, but I can't reveal either one without spoiling the show."
B007A1DSQ0 In \"Awake\", L.A. police detective Michael Britten survives a terrible car accident to live in a bifurcated world, one in which his wife survived the accident, the other in which his son survives.  Every time Michael goes to sleep, he finds himself in the other reality.  He is under psychiatric counseling in each reality.  Amusingly, his respective shrinks insist the reality is a dream.The season only lasted thirteen episodes, which was far too little to enjoy Michael working his way through cases that seemed to overlap between his realities; clues from one helped solve crimes in the other, baffling his two different partners.  Viewers would learn that Michael's accident wasn't what it seemed to be.  He was the target, or the victim, of a conspiracy whose true dimensions were unclear until nearly the end of the season.  At the end, Michael's dogged pursuit of the truth risked both death and madness.\"Awake\" sustained a complicated plot; the final episodes of the season were a masterpiece of misdirection and paranoia, as Michael's two worlds began to collide.  Highly recommended."
B007A1DSQ0 This addictive, all-too-short season was superior to most other detective shows right up until the last episode, which delivered a very unsatisfying conclusion to an otherwise outstanding series. I know of no other program that tried to pull off what AWAKE successfully did. I'm not overly fond of detective shows unless they wield a sharp creative edge, but this one far surpassed any expectations (although I wasn't convinced by the pilot alone: it took a few eps to get really hooked). The plot device of the one psychiatrist being supportive of the protagonist's \"dreams\" and the other trying to shatter his \"non-reality\" worked very well; I ended up viewing it partly as an examination of different approaches to issues of grief and separation from reality. For anyone with an interest in dreams from an anthropological or psychological angle, this is well worth your time.I have to admit that I am a fan of Laura Allen (the protagonist's wife) from her role inThe 4400: The Complete Series, and I am now a fan of Jason Isaacs due to his very capable acting as the star of AWAKE. I can think of only 3 reasons why you may not want to watch this show: [1] you may be left with the desire to watch season 2 (which doesn't exist), [2] if you have lost a spouse or child this may bring back painful memories, and [3] the final episode is actually worse than if they had not produced a final episode, as the \"happy ending\" makes absolutely no sense (although if you need happy endings for your entertainment, then perhaps you can live with this massive cop-out of an ending).Overall: 2 thumbs up, and 3 cheers to NBC for at least giving it a chance."
B007A1DSQ0 I'm realy tired of so called cop shows that deal with 'alternate realities'. This one lost my interest in the first five minutes. I just don't care.Mistery and suspence should be based on real life. There is plenty there. Imaginary situations should be left to sci-fi and fantasy, not a suposed 'real world'.Thumbs down, all the way on this one!"
B007A1DSQ0 Since the season of DOWNTON ABBEY is over for the year it is refreshing to come upon an intelligent new series that is fresh, fascinating,  well acted and takes a new stance on not only law enforcement but character development and the more serious questions of what happens to the person left behind after a tragic accident.After a car accident takes the life of a family member, police detective Michael Britten (Jason Issacs) lives two alternating parallel lives, one with his wife (Laura Allen) and one with his son Rex (Dylan Minnette). Is one of his \"realities\" merely a dream? These are the dilemmas Michael faces with the help of his two psychiatrists - BD Wong and Cherry Jones - and each psychiatrist deals with the family member Michael is convinced is still alive.  What is reality, what is dream, what is the effect of grieving?Writer Kyle Killen works this conundrum along with Michael's function as a detective - partnered with detective `Bird' (Steve Harris) and detective rookie Efrem (Wilmer Valderrama) - and as they investigate murders episodes from Michael's strangely bifurcated lives add additional mystery.It will be interesting to see how this storyline develops: nothing is obvious from this first episode except that for an opening story, this one shows great promise.  Grady Harp, March 12"
B007A1DSQ0 NBC's new drama, AWAKE, which premiers officially on March 1, is an intriguing, edgy story about a man struggling to deal with loss in the aftermath of a tragic accident. Police detective Michael Britton (Jason Isaacs) can't remember much about the car accident itself, but he finds himself living in two alternating realities, one in which his wife died and the other in which his son did. He goes to sleep in one world and wakes up in the other, never quite sure if either, or both, are real. He sees a therapist in both worlds (B.D. Wong in one, and Cherry Jones in the other) and he has different partners at work (Wilmer Valderrama and Steve Harris). The cases Michael must investigate in the two worlds seem to oddly interconnect, and both therapists insist he's creating one reality to protect himself from losing both his wife and his son. But could both realities be real?How does the pilot stack up as a potential TV series?First the positives:1. Strong acting - all of the major players are solid. Jason Isaacs, who most will remember from his role as Lucius Malfoy in the HARRY POTTER films, is wonderful as Michael Britton. This is a man torn between sanity and loss, and his grief is visceral and understandable. The supporting players are excellent, as well, especially B. D. Wong and Cherry Jones, who portray very different kinds of therapists who come up with exactly the same diagnosis.2. Clever and original premise - AWAKE does remind me of the American version of LIFE ON MARS (where a police detective finds himself inexplicably living twenty years in the past), but only on the surface. This is an original idea, with the potential to be very exciting as Michael learns more about the two realities he's living in.3. It's a scripted drama! - this is a big deal these days, with so many reality shows and singing competitions taking up air time. I was a big supporter of TERRA NOVA, I have high hopes for Kiefer Southerland's TOUCH. It's the same for AWAKE. I'm really hoping it catches on.Now the negatives:1. May be a tricky premise to pull off - I kept thinking this would have been so much easier done as a film or a limited-run mini-series with a finite ending. As with LIFE ON MARS, I want to know what's really happening here! Is Michael dreaming one reality to compensate for the loss of one of his family members? If so, which one is real? Or is Michael really living in two worlds, one with his wife and the other with his son? Or could Michael be the one who died in the accident, and what we're seeing is simply his afterlife? I don't know whether this will work as a weekly police procedural. We'll just have to see.2. Why doesn't Michael do more investigation? - The fact that Michael's two realities blur into each other (similar elements to both of the two cases he investigates, some characters appear in both realities, etc.) would suggest that he needs to do a little investigation. For example, has he ever tried to locate Dr. Evans (Jones) when he's in Dr. Lee's (Wong) reality? These aren't completely different worlds, after all. The same people seem to exist in both, as well as the same police station, the same house, the same music, etc. Or is Michael's fear of losing either of his realities keeping him from looking into things too deeply?3. Is it too cerebral for the viewing public? - Does it require you to think too much? LIFE ON MARS didn't make it past the first few episodes. Will AWAKE fare any better? This is a show that challenges you as you're watching. Its pace is slower than the SVU/CSI/NCIS franchises that have been dominating the airwaves for the last decade. Will viewers be willing to stick with Michael and his efforts to hold onto his family as he solves cases that will never be the central focus of the show? I don't know. I hope so, because AWAKE deserves a chance.I'm planning to stick with AWAKE over the next few months. The pilot is definitely worth watching."
B007A1DSQ0 This imaginative, mind  bending and clever series probably would have been much better off as a 6 part mini-seriesdone for pay TV.As it is, it starts terrifically, with a detective (well played by producer Jason Isaacs) coming to after a terrible auto accident.He finds he never really sleeps, only awakens into two different worlds.

B007A1DSQ0 A must see mind bending ! My gess is that the main character is in the coma , his wife and son are alive and nothing of it is \"real\" :)"
B007A1DSQ0 Its's easy to feel for the tortured main character. His confusion and frustration is relayed well by the former Lucius from Harry Potter."
B007A1DSQ0 There's nothing at all in the first 10 minutes to keep anyone interested.  I bailed early because I was falling asleep."
B007A1DSQ0 I skipped over this Prime selection many times because the pic on the front looks like a nauseated Dustin Hoffman. Yesterday, I decided to watch an episode. Now, I am the end of the series after being totally engulfed by the story. I have done an Awake marathon. This series is that good.Jason Isaacs gives a very powerful performance. He brought me to tears and that is not easy to do. Watch closely, pay attention and enjoy."
B007A1DUYA This is my new favourite show.Some of the episodes are not quite as toothy as others,this one is very chew it over again. And again.Are they telling us that the life with his son is the real one? Naw that would be too easy..."
B007A1DUYA Since the season of DOWNTON ABBEY is over for the year it is refreshing to come upon an intelligent new series that is fresh, fascinating,  well acted and takes a new stance on not only law enforcement but character development and the more serious questions of what happens to the person left behind after a tragic accident.After a car accident takes the life of a family member, police detective Michael Britten (Jason Issacs) lives two alternating parallel lives, one with his wife (Laura Allen) and one with his son Rex (Dylan Minnette). Is one of his \"realities\" merely a dream? These are the dilemmas Michael faces with the help of his two psychiatrists - BD Wong and Cherry Jones - and each psychiatrist deals with the family member Michael is convinced is still alive.  What is reality, what is dream, what is the effect of grieving?Writer Kyle Killen works this conundrum along with Michael's function as a detective - partnered with detective `Bird' (Steve Harris) and detective rookie Efrem (Wilmer Valderrama) - and as they investigate murders episodes from Michael's strangely bifurcated lives add additional mystery.It will be interesting to see how this storyline develops: nothing is obvious from the first episodes except that for an opening story, this one shows great promise.  Grady Harp, March 12"
B007A1DUYA The first episode of any new series has the unstated obligation, both to its audience and for the sake of its own survival, to grab us viewers by the throat -- and never let go.If lackluster Episode 1 of AWAKE -- and that's all I've watched thus far -- is any indication of what's on the horizon, then expect to see this poorly directed series aborted before the completion of its first term.What I found most irritating was the unsubtle (unconvincing!) transition between the two alleged realities. They just seemed to pop up out of nowhere, adding to the already confused plot.After the first 40 minutes -- AND HERE COMES A POSSIBLE SPOILER, FOLKS, SO BEWARE! -- I had an uneasy sense of foreboding (so did two other friends watching this) that it was our hapless protagonist himself who had actually died (not his beloved wife or son) and who now was destined to wander around LOST (like that other series) in an alternate realty between this world and the next...or at least until \"The Redeeming Light of Truth\" -- hopefully not another contrived deus ex machina --  might set his hitherto unenlightened soul free."
B007A1DUYA Episode 2 of AWAKE (\"The Little Guy\") makes it very clear what works about this show and what doesn't.  I was very involved in Michael Britton's personal life, including his sessions with the therapists in his two different worlds, and his relationships with his wife and son.  I was less interested (and bored, even) with the police procedural elements of the episode.  With just 45 minutes of airtime, it's hard to do justice to a crime story when the most compelling aspect of the series has nothing at all to do with police work.Then again, maybe it does.  \"The Little Guy\" throws a monkey wrench into the debate over whether Michael (Jason Isaacs) is dreaming one of his realities - something is very fishy about that car accident that killed his wife or his son (or maybe both of them).  The writers have decided we need a conspiracy to chew on, so they give us one in the final minutes of this episode.  I have very mixed feelings about this, especially since it sets up yet another kind of story we'll have to juggle in future episodes.A few things to notice in this episode:1) There's a distinct green tint to the scenes that take place when Michael is with his son, Max, and a red tint to the scenes that take place when Michael is with his wife (the colors correspond to the rubber bands he wears on his wrist to keep himself straight on which reality he's living in at any given time).  This was also present in the pilot episode, however I didn't really notice it.  Now, I do.  And it's a little distracting!  I found myself watching for the color changes and losing track of the story.  Hopefully, this is just a temporary distraction, and it will all fit together seamlessly as the show continues.2) Michael seems much more adjusted in this episode.  He lives both realities as if both members of his family are alive.  This proves to be a problem for his wife, who is grieving for her dead son, but it also ends up helping her.  There's a very nice little storyline involving a motorcycle that effectively illustrates how grief works and how Michael's bifurcated life might actually help all three of his family members cope.3) The \"bleeding\" between realities continues here, with elements of the \"green\" crime seeping into elements of the \"red\" crime.  Michael continually baffles his two partners by coming up with leads that make no sense to them (since they are based on things he's learned in his other reality).  This ramps up the mystery element, since the only way this would make sense is if Michael's dream state is psychic in nature (he's either clairvoyant or someone else is pulling the strings).4) That leads me back to the conspiracy element we discover in the final minutes of the episode.  The accident wasn't an accident.  Which means someone wanted Michael and his family dead.  So it's beginning to look like the crimes Michael is solving in his two realities will have some connection to the mystery he needs to ultimately solve (a mystery he doesn't even know exists).I plan to keep watching.  I definitely support scripted television, and this one is smart and intriguing, even if I'm not sure it will all hold together enough in the long run.  Give it a chance.  It needs an audience, and I do think it deserves one."
B007A1DUYA This imaginative, mind bending and clever series probably would have been much better off as a 6 part mini-seriesdone for pay TV.As it is, it starts terrifically, with a detective (well played by producer Jason Isaacs) coming to after a terrible auto accident.He finds he never really sleeps, only awakens into two different worlds. The moment he falls asleep in one, he awakens in the other.In one, world his son survived the accident and his wife died, in the other, the reverse is true. He has no idea which is a dreamand which is reality. He even has psychiatrists in each world trying to convince him that THIS is the real world. This is a great setup to deal with loss, grief, alternate realities, illusion, madness, etc.The problem is the middle of the series, when it gets away (somewhat) from the protagonist's fascinating confusions to try andact like a regular police procedural, with Detective Britton solving a \"case of the week\" in each world, usually abetted by someoverlapping clue from his other world of existence.

B007A1DUYA I write this having watched the entire series.  I was hooked from the get-go.  Impressed by the writing and psychological aspects, I found myself disappointed in a few episodes that seemed to stress the procedural &#34;murder of the week&#34; aspect.  This would have been much stronger as a more serialized story.There are a few standout episodes, among the best television has ever had to offer, and the casting is spot-on.  I enjoyed the season finale, and while I was disappointed that it wasn't renewed for any other seasons, I felt total closure.  My interpretation was different than my wife's and my parent's, who felt like they were given the middle finger at the end, so I suppose it is up for debate.  But as for me, I loved every second and wish there was a physical media release for me to hold onto and show people.  Oh, well."
B007A1DUYA I thought this show had an original plot that was quite intriguing. It's a detective show with an underlying conspiracy, and a main character that has trouble distinguishing reality from his dream world, with both worlds seeming to influence the other. I liked the cast, as well. Too bad is seems to be discontinued."
B007A1DUYA A fascinating and well constructed TV show \"Awake\" has a pretty intriguing idea; Detective Michael Britten (Jason Issacs Malfoy's father in the \"Harry Potter\" movies)shuffles between two \"realities\" one where his wife died in a car accident and the other where his son did. He's ordered to see a psychatrist to help him sort through his personal tragedy but, as the Britten makes clear, when he goes to sleep he \"wakes up\" in the other reality. Even more unusual Britten finds that cases in one \"reality\" intertwines with the other helping him to solve the cases he's assigned.Issacs is marvelous as Britten and although the pilot spent a bit too much time with Britten in the two different psychatrists' offices (one for each reality and, interestingly enough, they differ on how they feel about Britten's \"worlds\"), it does give the audience someone they can identify with and that can also ask the questions that viewers want to know since everyone else that surrounds Britten doesn't know about his dual reality experience.Written and produced by \"Lone Star\" creator Kyle Killen and featuring veteran writer-producers such as Howard Gordon (\"The X-Files\", \"24\", \"Homeland\")providing support, \"Awake\" has potential provided that the story arc involving who was behind the \"accident\" that Britten had and robbed him of the two people he loved the most in his life doesn't become too convoluted.The pilot was extremely good while the show has only gotten better with succeeding episodes. Hopefully \"Awake\" can find an audience and keep it so that the series can survive to a full second season (it's a mid-season replacement with an order of 13 episodes to date).Recommended."
B007AB6Q28 As my title says, \"Brake\" is a mixed bag in that it generates definite interest based on the atmosphere while adding some very implausible dialogue. A young cool professional dude is trapped in a clear rectangular box while we deduce terrorists want info on the US  president.I believe a greater fear would be upon most in this situation, and although there are people who are committed to their core ethics, they would be much less defiant not knowing what kind of further evil treatment would be forced upon them. A little too movie-esque  for my taste. The film reaches into past ideas as it unravels it's true meaning which would be a spoiler here (as if some haven't done that already). The \"ending/ending\" was actually satisfying and broke free of the predictable endings we have seen time and again. The last 15 minutes of the film were the best and held to realism that left an impression on me. It is unfortunate that the prior one hour and fifty minutes didn't equal it.Not a bad time passer if your trapped in your own box (a motel room)."
B007AB6Q28 Exceptional thrillers have a great way of taking control of an audience's ability to generate its own adrenaline and then hit the gas pedal.  The Fox TV series \"24\" did this to very solid acclaim through most of its run on the small screen, and films like DIE HARD and even the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy make use of the popular `race against time' formula.  The ticking clock scenario also presents actors with a unique challenge to take the viewers along with them for the wild ride, knowing that every second counts when any timepiece is winding down to `zero.'For all of its merits (and there are plenty, including a solid central performance by Stephen Dorff), BRAKE comes off as more than just a bit convoluted.  The story?  Jeremy Raines (Dorff), a secret service agent, wakes up trapped inside a sealed glass box located inside the trunk of a vehicle.  He has absolutely no idea of how he got there - the script only provides a few hints as to his activities beyond the events of this film (sorry, folks, but I found that a BIG weakness).  However, the box is outfitted with a few attachments - an LED clock counting down, an air supply, a cell-phone-type device, an old CB radio - and he's soon informed by his captors that unless he'll divulge the physical address of `Roulette' that they'll kill him and his young wife.  What is `Roulette'?  It's the bunker location that would hold the President of the United States (POTUS) and the Vice-President in the event of a terrorist attack.  Raines spends the next hour trapped inside the box while being subjected to all kinds of torture, all the while trying to make contact with the outside world to let them know that he's been caught and being held by suspected terrorists.It's a suspenseful tale that works as a thriller mostly because of Dorff's work.  In fact, most of the problems involve a script that lacks any real narrative center.  (It's difficult to discuss without spoiling the surprise ending, so I'll have to leave it at that.)  Suffice it to say that, as an agent, Dorff uses his smarts to try to affect an escape ... but he never uses his smarts well enough to deduce what's really going on here.  Part of that is because of the story taking place in the outside world - he's led to believe that there's a series of smaller attacks unfolding against Washington DC - but, were that the case, why weren't all of the folks he contacts through the CB radio equally as concerned?  There are a few other creative missteps that involve Raines' unique medical condition - certainly if the terrorists knew as much as they suggest they know about the agent's background - why would they have chosen one unique form of torture (you'll have to watch it to understand that point)?Still, BRAKE works as a thriller, and I tend to give it a pass on that level alone.  There's a nice dabbling of conspiracy backed with some interesting political developments in there to keep an audience's interest.  While it may not succeed on every level, it certainly presents a viscerally claustrophic thrill-ride so long as you can endure it for 90 minutes.  It was fun to see how it all worked (or tried to work), and, despite a few flawed choices in the script, it delivers enough entertainment to be a solid guilty pleasure.  I'll probably never spin it in the DVD player again, but, as a one-off flick?  I had enough fun with it to give it a confident three stars.BRAKE was produced by Walking West Entertainment and Costa Productions, La.  DVD distribution is being handled through the MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds exceptional; pay particularly close attention to the skillful layering of the audio track as some of the hints/clues that are dropped happen so quickly they might escape your attention.  The disc comes with a making-of featurette, a music video, and the theatrical trailer (though I'd encourage you to NOT watch the trailer before you watch the motion picture IF you prefer your films completely unspoiled as there are a few spoilers in there for the whiz-bang twist of an ending).  It's an affable collection, nothing great, for a film that'll have limited audience appeal.RECOMMENDED.  While it may not enter the history books as the greatest film ever, BRAKE works as a serviceable thriller for a post-9/11 world.  Sure, some parts of it may seem very far-fetched, but, like any good episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, it's the type of film that you'll watch differently if you spin it again.  Maybe a second or third time through you'll catch a few scenes that slipped by completely unnoticed the first time, if you're so inclined to give it another pass.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films and MPI Home Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of BRAKE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B007AB6Q28 People alive in boxes whether buried or not have shown up in a few movies the past couple of years, e.g. \"Buried\". This one had more techy stuff (camera, phone, CB radio, annoying red LED clock) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it's (How did I get here?) occupant. Just like a person in a box not knowing what's going on, this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90% of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off. To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider."
B007AB6Q28 By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSJeremy Reins (Stephen Dorff) wakes up in the trunk of car. He doesn't know who put him there but he guesses it has something to do with his job. He's a secret service agent.He's actually in a plastic box within a trunk. There is a red digital clock at one end counting down. He has a two-way radio and finds he can communicate with another prisoner, that's trapped in another trunk. There's a tube from the front of the cab,  through which things can be dropped into his box. A card is his first clue. On one side is a picture of the White House, on the other the words, \"Give us the location of roulette.\"\"Brake's a unique one,\" Stephen said. \"It's almost like an experimental movie. We made it in 10 days, and this 19-20-year-old kid (Timothy Mannion) wrote the script. I thought it was a clever concept in a time when Hollywood's frankly not being that clever lately.\"Make no doubt about it Stephen's acting, the idea and the director, Gabe Torres, make Brake work.The movie was dedicated to Stephen's mom, who he lost a few years back to cancer. This is a great little thriller film you'll miss if you don't seek it out soon.\"We pretty much stay in this confined, claustrophobic space for, I think, 67 minutes,\" Stephen said. \"For me, it's manipulation. It's a game, this film. Ultimately, there are a couple twists once I get out of the truck, which I really can't go into because I would probably ruin the movie for you.\""
B007AB6Q28 \"Brake\" is another in a recent string of claustrophobic thrillers set entirely in one small confined space. Instead of the \"buried alive\" aspect, though, the hero of this piece is locked into a transparent box and held in the trunk of a vehicle. And as he tries to figure out just what is going on, it seems that the outside world is alive with terror plots and conspiracies. Just why is this guy locked up? Who is doing it? And what do they need from him? These are the questions that Stephen Dorff wrestles with as he remains the sole character on screen for the entire length of the movie. When the audience is trapped with the film's protagonist in a stagnant space, there is a tendency (if not done correctly) for the picture to get monotonous. \"Brake\" does a serviceable job of keeping things interesting, but mostly because it adds dangers that are patently ridiculous.Slight Spoilers:I mean really, who would believe that ANYONE would be carrying around a load of bees?And the box has the capacity to fill with liquid in the trunk of a car? Where's it coming from?End of Slight SpoilersReally, though, I didn't expect too much from \"Brake.\" I just wanted to be entertained. The movie starts with an intriguing premise so I overlooked many of the wild plot developments because I was genuinely interested to see where this journey would take me. While not exactly riveting throughout, it made for a perfectly passable popcorn movie. Dorff seems to be taking on more and more of these direct-to-DVD type roles (although this had a small release, it feels direct-to-DVD) and I'm not sure why. He's actually quite good here as he becomes increasingly unhinged. And he is the absolute center of the piece. Although the movie boasts names such as Tom Berenger and Chyler Leigh, they get but a moment of screen time. No, this is Dorff talking on a CB radio followed by Dorff talking on a cell phone followed by Dorff talking through a tube. I think you get the idea, it's all Dorff!The principle storyline revolves around a political conspiracy and, never for a minute, did I believe any of it. Still, I'd have rated this 3 (possibly 3 1/2) stars if not for the ending. You think the rest of the movie is silly? Just wait for the twists (there are more than one, that's all I say). Any goodwill I had toward \"Brake\" flew out the window with these nonsensical revelations. They turn this mildly engaging movie into one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a while. None of these last minute twists can withstand even the slightest intellectual scrutiny and the definitely put the brakes on my enjoyment of the movie! KGHarris, 7/12."
B007AB6Q28 All the other actors appear in the last few minutes of the movie. I guess if you are a Stephen Dorff fan and enjoy looking up his nostrils for over an hour then this is the movie for you. Tom Berenger is the size of a whale and can't find a tie long enough to reach to his belt. A copy of \"Buried\" and less interesting. An IFC Film so look for it on Netflix in the next 3 months or so."
B007AB6Q28 Jeremy (Stephen Dorff) is a secret service agent taken captive. He is in a plexiglass box in the trunk of a car for about the entire film. Normally I hate these one man movies of a person being trapped, but this one had enough hope, like a carrot on a stick, to hold my interest. With his wife being threaten as well as other people, Jeremy is being pressured to divulge information about secret locations of the POTUS.Stephen Dorff did a convincing job in this one man thriller and then it happened. The ending. The ending made an improbable but interesting film into a laugher.4 stars if you don't watch the last 5 minutes.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
B007AB6Q28 \"All right just calm down, breath...breath.\" When secret service agent Jeremy Reins (Dorff) wakes up in a trunk of a car he thinks he is just kidnapped. When he begins to talk to someone through a CB he discovers it is much worse. He will die, along with people he knows unless he helps the terrorists. Helping them means telling them where the President it at. I need to tell you that I really liked the movie \"Buried\". I thought it was very tense all the way through. This movie is very similar to that one as it is basically just one man in a box for the whole movie. The one LARGE difference is the ending. I was hooked and on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie I was going to give it an A because of how sucked in I was and how tense it made me feel. Then I watched the last ten minutes. The ending was so bad that all the momentum it had going for it left like a balloon popping. It just came out of no where and didn't make any sense at all. It almost totally ruined the movie for me. Overall, a great movie but had one of the worst endings I have ever seen. I give it a B."
B007AB6Q28 In this mildly entertaining thriller Stephen Dorff plays a man trapped inside a plastic case. To reveal his occupation may spoil the film's plot, so let me call him just a man. His name is Jeremy Reins, and as the film starts, he wakes up in the dark, confused and disoriented, to find there is something like a digital clock before him. The countdown is going on and it seems there is more than one person who is trapped like him. What is going on?Comparison is inevitable. The opening of \"Brake\" strongly reminds of \"Buried,\" in which Ryan Reynolds' character finds himself buried alive inside a coffin. Now let me quickly add that Gabe Torres' \"Brake\" differs from \"Buried\" at several major points. Without revealing too much, I can say that similarity ends pretty early on in the story, where we know why Jeremy is held captive.So far, the film is good. In spite of Stephen Dorff's solid performance, however, \"Brake\" is not as thrilling as it should be. The plot development is slow and contrived. The film cannot maintain the claustrophobic atmosphere that grabs our attention at its beginning, showing its hand too early in its attempt to keep us interested. The film's mid-section feels drawn-out, with gimmicks (like the \"countdown\" and the attacking bees) that are random and pointless. It borrows ideas from other thrillers and never develops them.Several reviewers have criticized the film's ending. While I agree with them, I also think the weak script is to be blamed for the ineffective development of the story. In short, we don't know what the trapped man wants (or needs) to do. His own survival or something else? The story goes around and around, not knowing where it wants us to take. \"Brake\" has a nice idea, which is ultimately half-baked."
B007B9Q8K4 If you want to study the psychology of human behavior and be entertained at the same time...this is an interesting way.  When the going is easy the winners are always nice and kind.  When the going gets tough those with character and integrity are easy to spot."
B007B9Q8K4 It is truly amazing what they put these people thru. You really feel for these people when they win or loose."
B007B9Q8K4 I started to watch the first episode and nearly fell asleep at the start! The intro to the teams competing was too long. i think there were too many competitors too! When the two brothers started their talk on their background, I stopped downloading/streaming and went to somethng else.This series main goal is to capture the competitors emotional up and downs for drama - same attention drivers give when passing a traffic accident. Slow and tedious."
B007B9Q8K4 Love the show, always have.  Wish they'd put more seasons on Prime.  This season has a couple of annoying players, but still a great watch!"
B007B9Q8K4 A good season...contestants I loved and some I hated. Drama between teams as always.  Interesting locations, a good variety of road blocks. Fun season to watch."
B007B9Q8K4 I'm hooked on The Amazing Race. Just watched season 20. Something good came out of being sick. I was trolling Amazon Prime last week and stumbled upon the show. Seen it? Where has this show been all my television viewing life? This show is so engaging with somewhat ordinary people going to exotic spots in the world to compete in crazy challenges. I'm in a season of life where my commitments keep me stuck at home. The Amazing Race gives me the chance to see places that I may never visit in my lifetime. The contestants have qualities that the everyday person can relate to. Bottom, line, the show is a lot of fun! I'm a late coming,  raving fan of the show!"
B007B9Q8K4 Bopper and Mark were the only redeeming characters from this season. I couldn't stand how two of the couples treated each other all season long, and don't even get me started on the whiny B**** Rachel. Just plain pathetic, I don't even know how she won Big Brother, but I'm sure I only need 2 guesses."
B007B9Q8K4 my wife and I are completely hooked on this show. We sit around and watch entire seasons over the course of a weekend"
B007B9Q8K4 This season of the Amazing Race was about as good as any. Seeing a team go from last to first in just two legs was good. So was the finale: it wasn't a gimme for any of the three teams racing in it. At some point or another in that episode, each of the three teams was pulling ahead of the others."
B007B9Q8K4 This series has me hooked season-to-season. Phil &#34;the eyebrow&#34; Keoghan is terrific as the host and the producers always seem to have villain-sorts in the competition to keep dramatic tension high.I recommend the series from the first to the last. You can even find Amazing Race originating in other countries (like Australia and Philippines) if you want to see how it's done elsewhere."
B007B9Q8K4 I love this show it is so fun to watch, and this season had some great people. I hope it continues well into the future."
B007B9Q8K4 As always, another great season, but at this point, we wouldn't expect anything less.  I love the new places they are traveling to, it's always exciting to see what's outside my own backyard."
B007BECHEK I think it is wrong to say it was good for a woman to have a car accident and almost die, and that is a for instance.  Overcoming adversity does not achieve a greater happiness.  It achieves survival, which provides opportunity for more happiness.  The happiness of a child is probably the greatest example of happiness.  They feel safe, they feel loved, they know they have their needs taken care of.  Look at the child who does not have those things - the child who may be fostered and feel out of place.  The child who is abandoned.  Those will never be good things in life.  There are many layers to happiness.  Some come from within and some come from being stimulated - by others who love you and by those whom you like and trust.  Happiness is finding a stability you can count on in life.  That stability may have to be one you are forced to create for survival; it may be a greater good of which you hope to find eventual fulfillment if things work out the way you hope. And while you are waiting for that, riding the wave is not such a bad state of mind.  As in this movie, the father devotes much time doing that literally.  It is no one's business to decide how happy you are with their own happy-meter.  If they want to be your friend, they will care, listen, and certainly not talk behind your back.  If that kind of relationship is achieved, that can bring times of happiness.  Though ultimately, happiness is a decision, we don't have to decide it all the time or have it as a goal.  It comes and sometimes it goes for a while and we need to ride the wave."
B007BECHEK Makes you more understand what determines our feelings. Some things you may already know. Many of the things I could identify with."
B007BECHEK Which is the greater achievement? Gross Domestic Product or Gross Domestic Happiness.This doc looks at individuals that live in conditions that the wealth accumulators would be sickened by (not in personal moral disgust but in personal hygiene).It looks at individuals who had it all but found that it wasn't at all as fulfilling as they had thought.It looks at individuals that sacrifice personal comfort to raise the comfort of others.It asks how we can justify (rationalize, i.e. the CNBC complex) compensatory consumption \"bigger everything\" at the expense of humanity. Sorry, but the school of trickle down econ escapism is in reality, just that - a trickle.The doc looks at societies and groups that measure out toward the top not only in happiness and, as a bonus, also correlate with longevity."
B007BECHEK I found myself becoming very introspective during this movie.  I really did a great deal of thinking after watching this.  I would happily recommend it and may actually watch it again.  I found it informative as well as uplifting."
B007BECHEK For me, the interviews and array of footage in this documentary are what make it so enjoyable.50% of our happiness is determined by our genetic composition, 10% of our happiness is based on our surrounding and 40% is unknown, leaving you to wonder if you can truly determine your own happiness in life. Personally I think yes. At the end of the day it is up to you whether you're going to let any stimuli effect your mood in any way. Everyone is different but one thing is for certain, we need outside stimuli to help process an emotional feed.This film visits many different cultures throughout the movie which really gives you a different perspective of what makes everyone happy or unhappy, regardless of their social or economic background. I would recommend watching this movie in a class or group environment as it fuels great topics of discussion. Two things to keep in mind is that this film is not a &#34;how to be happy&#34; and it does not go into discussion about people who may have disorders that would or could otherwise take control of their responses to stimuli (whether internal or external)."
B007BECHEK This was really interesting. I liked seeing how others are very happy in their lives when we might think they are unhappy."
B007BECHEK Very interesting movie.  Challenges your thoughts about your life, which is probably a good thing.  Everyone should see this movie."
B007BECIVC Watched this is the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep. Nice piece, nothing new to me, but it's interesting and grabs you."
B007BECIVC I thought this was an excellent assessment of our value system in assessing level of happiness.  I would recommend it to all.  Especially those who believe that you need &#34;things and money&#34; to be happy which are fleeting and temporary."
B007BECIVC This is a well done documentary covering positive psychology, featuring the theories of many doctors within the field. I've heard these theories before, and I honestly believe them to be true. To paraphrase, the general idea is that most Americans have been conditioned to erroneously believe that happiness is some distant goal that can only be achieved by means of achieving grand financial success and the acquisition of materials. However, this is not true- those who seek such elusive happiness get stuck on a never ending treadmill, seeking more and more, and never reaching this magical \"happy place\". Instead, happiness can only be achieved by taking satisfaction in one's current circumstances, by focusing on those things that we can be grateful for (which are oftentimes overlooked in our high speed, material-oriented society).In this film, statistics are offered as evidence for the increasing levels of depression in our population, but I think these are unnecessary- just take a look at the people in your environment and workplace, and it's easy to evaluate how many of them are truly happy. How many of them focus on the things that they don't have... as opposed to those who are grateful for the things that they DO have?The documentary paints the theories of positive psychology with rather broad strokes, but they're sufficient for the purposes of this movie, which is introducing viewers to the benefits of embracing happiness, here and today (not in some distant future where you're hypothetically wealthy and universally adored). They explore the means by which this can be achieved, such as taking pleasure in helping others, spending quality time with loved ones, and appreciation of what your environment has to offer. Scientific explanations are also offered (such as the firing of synapses in the brain and the release of dopamine), so it's not presented as magical mumbo-jumbo. Additionally, there are some interviews with some truly remarkable individuals who come from a wide range of backgrounds, and have come to find their peace and happiness by transforming their perspective on the world. Highly recommended!"
B007BECIVC I would think that a documentary on being Happy would have a palpable feeling of happiness to it. However, there were some depressing moments. I won't spoiled it for those who haven't seen this yet, but maybe I should warn folks. There's a woman who was ran over by a truck and had to have reconstructive surgery on her face. Granted, beauty shouldn't be a criteria for happiness, but I was caught off guard I guess.There is some good information. Like economically prosperous nations not necessarily being happy. Apparently having higher standards of living doesn't buy happiness. Stuff doesn't buy happiness. A really good documentary about these same principles is Tom Shadyac's I Am.I think that the name of this movie should have been named something else: Holding Life in the Balance, Achieving Balance, What Happiness Is Not. If you're going to name a movie Happy, then you got to back it up. The vibration of this movie is lower than say, The Secret. That movie transmit happiness. You feel happier just by watching it. Thank you - Rhonda Byrne - for The Secret.On another note, I like that this movie is set in different countries (India, Japan, Africa). I love hearing the native tongue(s) and seeing different cultures. Also, this movie has subtitles, so be prepared to read.On yet another note, there's gangster rap in this movie. That's inappropriate! You can hear Tupac being bleeped out (52 minutes into the movie, right before the comedian). Granted, the producers may be trying to reach a younger audience, but again, INAPPROPRIATE.Michael Pritchard was a great addition to the film - comedy, authenticity, and showing love to the kids."
B007BECIVC How else can you explore the concept of Happy without also exploring the flip side of Sad? This interesting documentary does both very well. The deaths of young working professionals in Japan was devistating. The joy of working people in a third world nation based on love of family, neighbors, etc. will put a smile on your face. What a great awakening to realize that a man with one of the worst jobs imaginable, running through rain and heat while drunken customers abuse him made him a wealthy man, in his own eyes because of that wonderful security.This documentary was at times a bit slow moving, but provided some excellent insight into the psychology of happiness in different cultural settings. Recommended!"
B007BECIVC What possessed anyone to try and tackle this as a subject matter is beyond me, such a subject can be both vague and slippery....the content was very interesting. I imagine the editing on this was hell as there was probably enough research and such for an entire series."
B007BECIVC Interesting view on positive psychology, but I would have liked it to be longer and more detailed. I'm biased though as I am a therapist and have spent a significant amount of time studying the topic."
B007C1K6NQ My two year old knows his alphabet and sounds with much help from this show. This is the type of programming I like my children to watch. My five year old and two year old are both entertained by it."
B007C1K6NQ My son loves it. It gives him another chance to enjoy the stories I grew up with in different ways.  I love it"
B007C1K6NQ I have a 3 1/2 year old and this show is very educational for her. Worth viewing with your child"
B007C1K6NQ I chose to rate this show 5 stars as well, because it's entertaining to adults and children! Like season 1 of yo gabba gabba, this show is fun, and it teaches young babies and children how to read and it teaches them their letters! Whoever says that a young child as young as 18 months won't understand what's going on, they're wrong! At 18 months, my little girl is pretty smart. She loves super why as well. I will recommend this show to parents with young and older children too! There's nothing that I dislike about this show."
B007C1K6NQ My daughter has learned so much from Super Why!, and it keeps her interested.  She started watching it when she was 2 and continues to watch it now (she's almost 4).  Still relevant, interesting, and educational."
B007C7UI8S When they killed Mitchell (Aidan Turner) I was sure he would be coming back, resurrected. Then they killed George, Russell Tovey, and Nina as well. What is WRONG with these Brits? They pull this s*** with Doctor Who every few years. Have a popular doctor or companion, who (probably) want more money, and kill them off or replace them. Like all the money has to go to the production company. No fair share to the actors. Replace them. Turner might have wanted out, but that is why you sign them to contracts, so they can't leave just because it's convenient.What is wrong with these Brits!!I thought I had 2 more seasons to watch. Bad enough they call it a series instead of a miniseries. But just acting like the actors mean nothing, is very annoying!"
B007C7UI8S After the first two episodes in this season, I thought I was done.  My lovely trio was rent asunder.  But Hal turns out to be much more appealing than Mitch, and Tom comes into his endearingly limited own.  By the end of the season we are back to a ghost, a vampire, and a werewolf.  Still sounds like a set up for a joke, and the humor is still sly, but for the most part, it's still working for me.  Me, who is NOT a fan of anything supernatural.  The writing and casting remain strong.I'm loathe to even try the US version once I finish with this series, but will...just to see how it translates.  Not too optimistic."
B007C7UI8S The new vampire and werewolf do nothing for the show... did not enjoy it at all. Miss the other characters they were awesome"
B007C7UI8S I was little sad to see all the orignal cast replaced; still not sure how well the new guy playing the vampire or the new girl playing the ghost will work out.  I'm hoping the redo maintains the great story telling, suspense, and just good Tv making f have grown to expect and deeply appreciate."
B007C7UI8S The end of the third series had been dramatic with the killing of Mitchell by George. But nothing is simple in this fourth series. Nina has disappeared because after giving birth to a girl she does not have time to name she is destroyed by some vampiristic mob. George is paranoid about the prediction that the baby is the saviour of humanity and has to be killed by the vampires when they come to take over the world, he understands it as if she had to be killed for vampires to be able to take over. He is unable to survive very long in that paranoia and thus he leaves Annie and the baby with an unfinished job, in his mind at least. If he knew the truth he would really be frightened. But the house is a real crossroads for vampires, werewolves and ghosts, provided they are all detached from the real monstrous things they may represent and they are trying to live human lives.A young werewolf comes back, Tom , and he is known of us so he is easily accepted and integrated even before George disappears. But he is still a kid and he has to learn how to fight and kill vampires since werewolves have that divine task to do.The vampire is more difficult to find. He is Hal, but in fact this is a nickname and they learn in due time he is an old one who has decided to leave the flock and wean himself, which he has been doing for fifty five years now, a short time after all when compared to the extreme length of his living dead survival he calls a life.  And being this old one he is also the future king of the vampires when they take the world over. He is Prince Harry, a common name for a prince since Shakespeare and quite popular nowadays.But this series has a new tone in a way because it is the series in which the old ones are coming to take over the world and they have to be destroyed. But the problem is the prediction. The baby called Eve by George on his death bed is the saviour of humanity. But is she the one who can protect humanity by being alive against the vampires? Or is she the one who can stop and destroy all the old ones by dying? Or is she the one who can open the gates to vampires by dying? The same question is at the heart of these questions: must Eve live and protect humanity or die and save humanity as well as destroy the old ones?In fact this question is not even accurate. Little by little we know the baby Eve has to die but the real question is how? Especially when the ghost of an eighteen year old Eve comes up into the picture to explain to Annie why she, Eve, must die.Of course it is all more complicated than that and our three main heroes will be joined by the ghost of Alex, a girl Hal had courted a little bit and who was killed by a certain Cutler, a vampire obsessed by making history and who trapped Harry into drinking her blood, which send Harry back on a frenzy of submissiveness to the oldest one of them all, the one from whom all vampire DNA comes and who finally arrives on earth to fulfil the prophecy.To spice up the tale we have flash-forwards into the future as it is going to be if the vampires take over. Something pretty scary since human beings will have to be eliminated except the number necessary to feed the vampires. Humanity will become the bleeding cattle of the newcomers. This is very similar to the means used in other series or in novels to achieve the same objective: to make the heroes save the present because there is no future without a present that is alive and well. I am thinking of Terminator of course, the whole saga, including the TV series of the John Connor's mother's diaries. I am thinking of Supernatural in which angels and archangels send the heroes Dean and Sam into the future the way it would be if they did not accept to play the game of the Apocalypse. I am thinking of many science-fiction books by Stephen King and others, including Ron L. Hubbard, that use the vision of the future to make us understand that we have to save the present.But here the present can only be saved by Annie, Tom and Hal. And it is saved of course, and the baby is sacrificed to save humanity. And it is the fire of god that does the business. They forgot to tell us clearly that this fire came from god but we can subsume it all by ourselves, can't we? The old ones will be destroyed of course because there are two ways to destroy vampires, a stake in the heart or fire. Now you have to watch the eight episodes if you want to know how and where and when and by whom.Three survivors: Hal, Tom and Alex, a phenomenal m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with an immediate emergency: to wean Hal from his having drunk some blood. We also discover another type of humans, but are they humans, people or beings who are supposed to keep the secret hidden and to collect all the evidence they can and that could reveal that secret to the world: the world is under the menace from vampires and among us we have quite a few vampires and werewolves. Those we can see, though the vampires are invisible in mirrors and cameras and telephone webcams, etc. The third type of monsters, if they are monsters of course, are ghosts and those are invisible, sorry folks, there must always be a cheater somewhere in any games and ghosts are the cheaters, and we are the losers of course.Who will win in the next series? The vampires, the werewolves or the ghosts? I am ready to bet on werewolves because they are sexy animals, whereas ghosts are immaterial and vampires are killing machines and blood suckers. Though the series is discreet about the intimate life of the heroes, when speaking of suction, there is better and more pleasurable things to do than suck blood. At least George was a practising believer as for that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
B007C7UI8S I am a huge fan of the British version of this show. I don't want to spoil it for others so no plot details. American viewers of the entire series need to realize that the cultural references are often quite opaque to us. The colloquial languages of Britain sometimes should be subtitled when exported. The Scots do it. However, I myself enjoy listening to the various dialects and find the challenge worth it. The entire series is wildly absurd, comically serious and somewhat philosophical. Those are just the qualities which the American version does not capture."
B007C7UI8S I really did love this show, until the characters started changing and the story line took off in a different direction.  Bring back all the old characters.  They were great.  The new ones are ok, but don't think I&#34;ll be watching this show if it continues on the same path."
B007C7UI8S its ok. good to have on in the background while doing something productive, if nothing else can be found. It has some slightly interesting stories. Sometimes gets convoluted.But it does make me wonder if everyone in the UK is a whiney little cry baby. I think in season 3, there was a scene where someone is about to die so everyone cries for like 5 minutes, & then the person dies & they all cry for 5 more minutes, then the ghost hangs out with them all & they all cry for another 5 minutes, then the ghost goes away into eternityland & everyone cries for another 5 minutes. & this isn't the first time a bunch of people sat  around a cried their eyes out in the series (more like every other 5 minutes someone starts crying for 5 minnutes)."
B007C7UI8S I enjoyed this TV show and glad I was able to catch up with season 4.  Its a great show and just wanted to see what happened in this season, my best description is wow."
B007C7UI8S Okay, I was very uncertain about continuing this series after finding out that not only did the show lose Mitchell's character, but George and Nina too! However, because I have yet to see any bad acting whatsoever in this series and I've become seriously hooked on its particular weird cross of Supernatural meets Monty Python I decided to stick with Season 4. And I'm very glad that I did. Both the new actors who bring the characters Hal and Tom to the show bring their characters to life and continue to charm me. I don't really think of them as replacements for the ones who've gone, but simply new friends in their own right. And of course Annie is lovely and sweet, but shows us in this episode that she isn't quite the pushover that she used to be. The first few episodes of the season were a bit shaky for me with so many new people coming onto the scene, but this episode is the one where the new set of friends finally, really click. You get the sense that Annie has once again found a home with her new vampire and werewolf friends and the three are united in their efforts to keep a young baby safe from other supernatural forces that want her dead. Sorry, not giving anything away. If you want to know what I'm talking about you have to watch the show.Without giving anything away I'd say if you had been shunning Season 4, because you can't reach for the remote without sobbing then it's time to dry those tears and keep watching. Because the one thing this show isn't ever going to be is dull and boring."
B007C7UI8S When they first killed off Mitchell and The original werewolf on the series, I though this show would go straight out the door. However, they replaced the two with great actors who filled their predecessor's shoes with no problem. At the end of this season the last of the original cast also leaves but the series just keeps getting better. Michael Socha, the new werewolf, is HOT and we will see more of him in the new TV series in the US called Once Upon A Time in Wonderland which is a real treat for us in the US!"
B007C7UI8S I really enjoyed watching this series. It was a little like the USA version but, enough not like it to keep you guessing. It's full of surprises and I wasn't sure what was going to happen next."
B007C7UI8S I am a big fan of both versions of this show, I love the American version as well as the original English series. I highly recommend both so check them out especially if you are like me, a big horror fan! I thought the idea of a vampire, ghost, and werewolf living together was the most original idea I had seen for a while. Great characters and well written stories that keep getting better as the series goes along."
B007C7UI8S Bought all the other season and loved them. Can not wait to watch this season and will be waiting for the next season to come out."
B007C7UI8S I hate how they turned this into the show about the ghost. She evolved from a frightened murder victim to empowered supernatural being over the first three seasons. But killing off all the characters but her, it's essentially a different show - and worse for it."
B007C7UI8S This is the end of an amazing team.  A show that started so strong, looses two of it's stellar team in the last season and in this one George leaves rather early.  So to fly the ship we have only Annie played by Lenora Crichlow.  She and the Mitchell replacement guy are the only ones who have a sense of the world it seems.  The new Werewolf guy plays heavy on the pauper to twin the vampire who is a prince.  Personally I wish that they just said something like Daisy had a magic ring that she used to control Mitchell and George and that's how she got Mitchell to kill the people on the buss and for George to bang her.  I never got why George did that.  He was never really a \"tool\".Anyway here we are in the middle of WW \"V\".  For some reason no humans want to become werewolves even though it would improve their odds greatly.  Only some people are aware of the the fact that Vampires have led the war.  Also Nina and George's child is the anti vampire Jesus but no one can find her even though she lives in the middle of England.  I like the new vampire but that's it.  Other new characters aside from the sweet but dumb werewolf include the ghost of an evil young Tim Gunn from \"Project Runway\",  A child rapist Mary Poppins accompanied by the vampire boy from before but they chose to make him dumb now.  There is a retro ghost girl who looks just like Kenley aldo from \"Project Runway\"  but unlike Kenley she hates all things retro except her and Annie points this out after this ghost insulted her tea.  Also there is a goth girl who is also dumb (This season love people acting stupid for some reason) who is made into a vampire by a sleazy ugly vampire and the go off to bang somewhere.  I made it up to episode 6 and just could no take it any more."
B007C7UI8S The cast of characters seems to be constantly fluctuating, but it actually does progress the story to have characters be lost, and new ones to fall in love with.The story manages to be grandiose, but still everything seems to be paying off (I have one more episode to watch).  Another great example of storytelling from the Brits."
B007C7UI8S Just streamed this in because i missed the BBC-A broadcast and i have to say that Instant video has gotten loads better since Season 3. The broadcast was continual and there were no issues, which was a nice.Season 4 of Being Human picks up where Season 3 left everything, with Mitchell dead and the roommate's in a spiral. It is not the only thing to have happened, however, and the happenings are huge. By the end of this episode the show will have gone through an enormous change and it leaves a lot of questions up in the air. I do not want to ruin any of that, because it kind of shocked me just how much they were willing to rearrange things. It also made for quite the show.Switching to scenes from 2037, there is a storyline being developed here that deals with George and Nina's baby, the War Child, and a prophecy that vampires have on it. I liked that idea, and the way the show was presented made me really wonder what was happening. honestly, I was afraid this would be a \"getting over Mitchell\" episode but it was far from that. It was a \"changing everything forever\" kind of show that makes me think that maybe the show is going out and going with a bang.I really liked the fact that they put some human in here, too, keeping some parts very serious and some parts light. The beginning kind of sits a tone there, contrasting the protective George and the seriousness in the home. There is also the introduction of some new faces, lots of them, and a new trinity of roomies that may be a new focal point. Combine that with a lot of \"go\" and you have the episode.I'm really looking forward to the show this season - 5/5"
B007C7UI8S You changed it! Shame on you! It took a whole season for me to really accept the new Mitch. Is his name now Tom?"
B007C7UI8S The actors and their characters are well matched, making this show feel more real and natural.  So far, there are not too many contrived situations; stories flow from the characters, how they interact with each other.  This season, the plots seem to only revolve around little mysterious baby, and a line up of evil opponents trying to take her away from the 3 show runners.  I miss the original actors from season 1-3, but I am surprised at how the new actors and characters fit so well, so quickly.  Very impressive.  I've tried to watch the US version, but find it doesn't measure up.  This UK version is better at mixing action, comedy, and mystery."
B007C7UI8S I've been a fan of both the Being Human series since the first seasons...both the British & Canadian versions. Both follow the same plot lines but each have their own character twists. Season 4 of the British series has some of the most fun new characters, delightful scripts & twists of all the previous seasons. Some characters leave and new ones are introduced but I'm looking forward for season 5 & just hope there WILL be a season 5."
B007CGLRWA Great movie.  The teenage years are a challenge even in the best of families.  These kids are at risk teens that only need attention, love and some understanding.  This teacher taught me to just give others encouragement and a chance to better themselves.  Lesson learned.  Great Movie!!!!"
B007CGLRWA Kaye the director of American History X complains about everything- especially the public education system and the dying hopes to save it. Adrien Brody is the substitute teacher who is good at his job but refuses to became a permanent teacher choosing to be leave - detached. Detachment is a long laundry list of everything that is wrong with education, sure there are moments of hope in it but they are few. The casting is impressive - Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, and James Caan but all of these sing the same sad song along with the lead. A very depressing movie about the public education system highlighting everything that is wrong with it but without showing the many glimpses of hope that teacher and students encounter everyday. Why does America hate education so much? Three stars. 4/15/2013"
B007CGLRWA Some actors seem to squander their talent to point where you wonder if what made them so great was a complete and total fluke; like the just lucked into one of those `right place at the right time' type things and really don't possess the talent you assumed they had.  Adrien Brody was one of those actors for me.  He was staggeringly good in his Oscar winning role in `The Pianist', and yet since 2002 he's starred in a slew of films that seemed to bring out the worst in him.  `The Village', `The Jacket', `King Kong', `The Brothers Bloom'; not all bad films (I happen to adore `The Brothers Bloom' and respect `King Kong') but none did anything for him.  He wasn't memorable and was completely outshined by his co-stars.  He was kind of like the Gyllenhaal of the bunch (although Gyllenhaal also had his redemption this year with `End of Watch').  That brings me to `Detachment', a film I was marginally interested in thanks to the name Tony Kaye and the fact that `American History X' is one of my favorite films of the 90's.  Early ink was very good on this and so I dipped in.  It didn't hurt that the cast was incredible (Caan, Liu, Danner, Cranston, Harden, Hendricks!!!).Brody wowed me.This was a very tough role to play, and Brody carried it off seamlessly.  His commitment to the details of his character's emotional relapsing was sensationally played, and the way that he evoked that inner struggle without playing to the obvious was certainly rewarding.  He was aided by a marvelous supporting turn in Sami Gayle, a stunning young woman who plays a prostitute in need of a helping hand.This film reminded me of a heavier handed and obviously more dramatic version of `Chalk'.  It attempts to look at the earthier side of teaching, the necessary detachment that floods the staff in order to teach without getting too involved.  As Henry (Brody's character) filters through the hallways and tries to remain at a distance, he finds himself inadvertently becoming a rock for his students, and as the world around him comes crushing down full force one gets a better grasp on why he holds the world at such a distance.If nothing else, `Detachment' will get you thinking."
B007CGLRWA You know how they say \"Teachers have the hardest job in the world?\"  Well this movie proves that's exactly 100% true.  The teachers that have to deal with students in the city are *especially* the ones who have the hardest job due to the aggressive  environment each and every day.  They have to find a way to get through to a group of students that are not only destructive but refuse to listen to reason concerning *anything* no matter how hard things are explained to them.  Not only that, but teenagers naturally want to test the patience of their parents and teachers because they feel like they've reached that terrible point in their lives when they've become big and bad enough that they think they *can*.  Test ones authority so to speak.I'm curious if some city public schools really *are* as graphic as the one portrayed here.  I imagine some of these incidents (that I won't spoil) are a bit exaggerated, but others -such as the one student who walks up to the front of the classroom where Adrien Brody is standing on the first day of the job and threatens to beat him up- are real.  I'd like to know if city kids are really THAT bad.  I spent all my years going to a public school out in the country that was significantly tamer than this school.Adrien Brody proves he's quickly becoming one of the best actors out of Hollywood since he can easily nail any role he's given, and his role as a substitute teacher here is downright terrific.  That's not all- he has to deal with an incredibly heart-breaking situation with his father in a retirement home and about to pass away that will leave many viewers in tears (especially me since I worry I might be in this exact situation some day in the future) in addition to meeting and taking in an underage prostitute on the streets that results in a *fantastic* ending (that I won't spoil, sorry!)  There's also a girl in the back of Adrien's class that's a special student and bonds with Adrien's character.  You don't realize until later how important her character is.The language in this movie is REALLY bad.  These students take every swear word in the book and use them in the most graphic way imaginable.  And they direct these words *directly* at the teachers.  Yes, if this movie is similar to real public schools in the city, teachers most certainly have the hardest job out there.  For some reason, the scene that stands out the most is the one with the Asian guidance counselor and the teenage girl who comes in failing every single class and lacking ambition.  The woman literally explodes on the girl by giving her a reality check as a way to get through to her and amazingly, it works.  The girl walks out of the room aware that underperforming is wrong.  Also love the old man (not sure who he was- perhaps another counselor or a substitute teacher) that speaks exactly the same way his students speak to him!  He does a tremendous job getting through to the students.  A little *too* graphic perhaps, haha.  He had me laughing hysterically in one segment when he takes a sentence one of his troublemaker students says and uses it in several different ways, such as imitating a play in one segment, LOL!  I can't share this scene in detail because amazon won't allow it!  The man is doing this not only to prove that he isn't the least bit affected by immature threats, but to humiliate the student.Overall, this movie had me moved to tears a few times because it's not all about swearing and awful language.  There's a clear element of understanding, compassion and trust that takes place between the teachers and students through LOTS of patience.  The teachers learn to build a wall as a way to block all the swearing and criticisms these teachers have to deal with on a daily basis.  In fact Detachment actually portrays how hard it is to live in the city, so it goes beyond public school difficulties.  Highly recommended."
B007CGLRWA Look, Adrien Brody is going to give you a great acting performance no matter what he's in. That's a given. Playing a character like this--lonely and intelligent is right in his wheelhouse. The problem given that is the filmmaking is way too artsy here. The flashback scenes look like bad Kodak film and are only hinting at what happened in Brody's character's past. We really don't get a clear picture at what exactly made him the way he is in the movie.Given that, though, there are enough poignant scenes and with a cast that includes James Caan, Lucy Liu, Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, Blythe Danner and William Peterson, there are plenty of underused heavy hitters in here. Yet the true star of the story is Sami Gayle who plays the very troubled young prostitute. She is a talent that is worth watching over the coming years.The extras are short on sweet on the DVD. A less than five-minute interview with both the director and Brody plus some Red Carpet interviews at one of the premieres."
B007CGLRWA I liked Adrien Brody better in this role than in THE PIANIST, for which he won the Oscar.  That is saying a lot but he sure delivers in this magnificent movie about the experiences of being a teacher.  He teaches in a tough school and the problems at that school don't pull any punches.  These problems are experienced by both the teachers and the students.  This is extremely well written and there is never a moment which lags.  Outside of school he begins taking care of a homeless girl, trying to get her into foster care.  He also cares for his grandfather who is dying in an aging facility.The film also cuts back to the past seamlessly and we learn about his early experiences living with his mother and grandfather before she killed herself.There is an adolescent girl student who is receiving no encouragement at home or elsewhere about her burgeoning art talent.  Brody is one of the few able to offer her some encouragement and solace.  But a woman dating him from the school mistakenly thinks he has other interests in the girl, which ruins things.  This leads to tragic consequences.But this is not a grim film.  Yes, it has some tough moments b
B007CGLRWA Adrian Brody deserves another Academy Award for his performance in Detachment! Yes, this film is hard to watch in parts (I do wish they had left out the brief animal cruelty scene and the smoking!), with so many of the students being good examples for better birth control, but I still believe that it has a redeeming message for the real heroes of the USA: TEACHERS, who help our kids to become better people (well, most of them!)"
B007CGLRWA While at times it seems the pace drags a little bi
B007CGLRWA DETACHMENT (Prod. Adrien Brody, Dir.  Tony Kaye, first released in France in 2012, 99 minutes) was a strange, poetic, depressing and in some ways disjointed film. It confused me slightly at first, because I had allowed myself to be misled by the little descriptive squib. The squib said Adrien Brody plays a substitute teacher who wanders from job to job so as not to get attached to any place or colleague.This film gives the lie to that lazy description. Brody plays Henry Barthes (pronounced \"Barth\"), substitute teacher and apparently Mr. Spock wannabe. Only it does not work out that way as he struggles with the demons of his childhood, his demented grandfather, a sweet underage prostitute he saves from the street (stunning performance by Sami Gayle, one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen) and a desperately suicidal student (the equally stunning Betty Kaye).At an unnamed, doomed New York high school for violent, subpar students, Mr. Barthes confronts and battles his demons of emptiness, loneliness, a horrible childhood and yes, his own detachment. The school is flailing in the grips of No Child Left Behind. Some of the teachers seem ready to do something insane; a few see their days are numbered.Mr. Barthes hands over the prostitute he has singlehandedly reformed to the foster care people - even though he plainly loves her as she loves him, and it seemed to me a very fatherly love. He also allows the suicidal student to slip through his fingers, and she exits this world in a terrifying scene I saw coming the second it started. Yet he is gentle, caring, compassionate and understanding because he carries the weight of the world on his own desperate shoulders.This film struck me primarily as a super-alarm about our children and what we are doing to them instead of doing for them. In a very moving scene, Mr. Barthes addresses his class and lectures them about all the things we truly believe yet simultaneously know are total lies. Using George Orwell's term \"doublethink\", Brody gives a tour de force performance as he drives home the message that we can be destroyed by all the overflow of nonsense. Whether they were his visions or something else, I was also terrified by the final scene of Mr. Barthes sitting in an abandoned old schoolroom - the very one in which he'd been teaching.What I did not get was all the pretense: unnecessary close-ups of Brody, as if he were being interviewed for \"20/20\" - and the film began with a few other such inanities, starring unrelated actors. But the 'interview' clips Brody performs are strewn throughout the film, as if they are supposed to mean something. Personally, I do not like arthouse nonsense like that. It was far too much like the awful FrenchThe Class (Entre Les Murs)(see my widely hated review), which may well have inspired it. What I believe is simply that an important message deserves an important delivery system, and I am not certain DETACHMENT accomplishes that.This film has a few true-to-life shocks and certainly merits an R rating. It has its flaws and a certain annoying arrogance. But it also taught me many things, and as I watched I found my depression lifting as though it were a light fog. There is something to be said for surrealist arthouse crap after all. As for Brody, I have said elsewhere that he'd have made a fantastic James Bond - and to that I now add that I would love to see him star in a biopic of inventor Nikola Tesla.With the very impressive, engaging talents of James Caan, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, and Blythe Danner."
B007CGLRWA Teaching isn't an easy gig under any circumstances. But, when you're Henry Barthes, in a crap-hole like this, it's darn near impossible.Here's the scoop. Henry Barthes is a substitute teacher who's had a troubled childhood. He likes subbing so he doesn't stay attached to anyone or any place. He's on assignment in a tough, inner city school. He wants to make a difference but fears he cannot. He helps a young prostitute and does what he can with both his students and fellow teachers, while looking after an aging, sick grandfather living in assisted care.This is a very powerful movie with a lot more grit than \"Up the Down Staircase\" or \"To Sir with Love.\" These kids are tough, mean spirited and not afraid to get in the teachers' faces with cursing and threats. Barthes (Adrien Brody) seems to work well here. He knows that standardized teaching is out the door. He needs to reach them so he uses unconventional methods to do so. They don't spend a lot of time in his class, but they spend enough to show his methods work. He has a knack for reading a situation and playing it correctly. He takes in, against his better judgement, a young (teenage?) prostitute who responds to his kindness, but this puts him in deeper than he would like. He prefers being detached.This is a heck of a movie. Brody has had a few mis-steps in his career but he does an outstanding job here. He found the voice in his character and stays on beat the whole time. There is a strong cast of back-ups as well. Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Christina Hendricks among others fill in the gaps very well. Sami Gayle as Erica, the prostitue, does a really good job for someone early in their career. The music is good, the writing, editing, cinematography etc. are as good as they need to be to make this happen.This does get heavy handed at the end and leaves some questions unanswered, b
B007CGLRWA DETACHMENT is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. Written by first time writer Carl Lund and directed by the controversial Tony Kaye (one would never know, but he performs music and comedy at open mics around Los Angeles), and presented by one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable, this film should be required viewing for everyone from junior high to the elderly.  In one poignant story we are provided glimpses into the current status of our public education, the plight of burned out teachers attempting to repair the absent parent syndrome while reaching out to find a place beyond drugs, fighting, physical and mental abuse and the lethargy of responding to a chaotic world, and a dark view of the existentialism that allows each of us to forge ahead despite a sense of worth in a world gone crazy.Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody in a galvanizing performance) copes with life as a substitute teacher: he comes into schools for a specific stint then detaches and repeats the cycle of caring to provide hope for kids to become someone of significance, failing repeatedly.  He is assigned to a New York school headed by the soon to be fired Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), meets a classroom of foul mouthed, disrespectful, angry students and attempts to teach them English. He is immediately challenged by a sassy kid whom he sends out of the room, a young angry black student with whom he connects by showing him parameters of interaction, a young obese, disturbed but gentle Meredith (Betty Kay, in a sterling performance) among others.  He also encounters the other teachers and staff - the beautiful Sarah Madison (Christina Hendricks), the school counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu), the burned out Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) and Ms Perkins (Blythe Danner) and Mr. Sarge Kepler (William Peterson), and only teacher who fights back with a sense of humor Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan).  It is a grim situation and Henry takes his depression home.Henry encounters a young girl Erica (Sami Gayle, in a career making role) who despite her youth is a street hooker, beaten badly by her johns. He offers her protection in his meager home - a place to sleep and eat and recover form the street abuse of her profession.  A profound relationship develops - and while that satisfies Erica's desperate need for family, it frightens Henry enough to eventually call foster care to remove her.  Henry visits his elderly mentally challenged Grandpa (Louis Zorich) who lives in a assisted living home and his frustrations about his memories of his apparently alcoholic suicidal mother and the lack of care being given his Grandpa results in one of Henry's rare explosions of anger - a rage that extends to every aspect of his view of life. At school Henry gradually wins the hearts and minds of his class, showing them that education is the path to living a life of meaning.  His friendship with the beleaguered Meredith is supportive, but as Henry completes his three week assignment at the school tragedies surround him.  It seems that everyone in the story is in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.In addition to the actors mentioned there are shining little vignette roles by Celia Au, Ren&eacute;e Felice Smith, Kwoade Cross, and others - many appearing for the first time on film and each radiating talent.  But the film belongs to Adrien Brody who provides such a staggeringly real character that his message is felt in every cell of the viewer's mind.  This is a first rate film in every aspect. It should be seen by everyone who either shares the mental milieu of the characters depicted here or cares deeply about the sad chaotic situation we have created during these particular times.

B007CGLRWA Dear Reader, made in a documentary style, Detachment is a product of director Tony Kaye (yes, the same guy who made American History X) and Adrien Brody (in yet another role of a life time) This is not one of those films that sit on the edge and meander, this film truly takes film making to another level and back to school. The screenplay is resounding and moving. The film deals with politics -> condition of teachers, student, white america, black america, fat american teenagers with insecurities, prostitution, the women degradation trip America has adopted, the importance of reading and to end it deals with loneliness. I would say it's the most moving relevant film of last year (2011) and trust you me I've seen atleast 25 very good films from the year. Adrien Brody kills it. Do yourself a favor and watch the film they're not going to honor with Oscar and noone in the world will talk about. If you thought American History X was ambitious, you're in for a pleasant surprise cause Detachment aims higher, barks louder and eventually leaves you flabbergasted."
B007CGLRWA Detachment follows substitute teacher Henry Barthes as he begins teaching at a rough and on-the-edge school for a month; it also follows the faculty of the school and the lives of the students. It may seem like this is your typical story of a teacher-class relationship and how everything works out and test scores are improved (etc.) because of the cover, but it's not. Although Detachment focuses on the poor education system and lack of motivation in some students, the film strongly focuses on the feeling being detached, being lost, being alone.The story is deep and powerful. It will take you on an emotion ride, if you let it. Some scenes will make you depressed/sad (possibly to the point of tears), while some scenes will infuriate you. I don't want to spoil some of the main scenes for you, but there are some short transition-like scenes that are equally effective; for example, there is a quick scene where the constantly bullied Meredith is eating in the restroom alone and another scene where she is bullied by her father, and these short scenes really got me. It all leads to a an amazing, although slightly predictable, ending. I really enjoyed how it showed the teachers' side of the story and how they often feel helpless and underappreciated. The cast was brilliant, especially Adrien Brody and I couldn't help but be amazed by Lucy Liu's powerful speech/rant when she snaps. The film is complimented by a somber soundtrack, which I really enjoyed. The short runtime benefits the film, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. I didn't really understand why Adrien Brody's character had some interview-style scenes throughout the film, though, and hoped that would be explained.Overall, I really enjoyed Detachment and felt like it had a significant message; I think everyone will get a message out of this film, or at least think about some of the issues it brings up. Detachment is a powerful, thought-provoking drama. As of 11/18/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.Detachment has some blood and violence, and nudity/sex."
B007CGLRWA Controversial director Tony Kaye certainly doesn't play it safe.  Notorious for \"American History X,\" Kaye has proven himself both outspoken and challenging as a filmmaker (and as a person).  Despite that film's positive reception by both audiences and critics (as well as its Oscar nominated leading performance by Edward Norton), Kaye publicly disavowed the movie after it was recut against his wishes.  So it's no surprise that \"Detachment,\" from a screenplay by Carl Lund, is like a brisk slap to the face.  A bleak and depressing portrait of the American educational system, the film is unrelentingly dark.  In its world view, it certainly has a refreshing candor and truth.  At times, though, the stylized nature of the movie can detract from its essence.  It is surely meant to provoke, which it does, but it also has the tendency to straddle the line of pushing over-the-top when a bit of restraint might have balanced the action.  Still, though, it's hard to fault someone willing to make a bold statement in these days of formulaic filmmaking.  \"Detachment\" has a lot to recommend it, but it presents a hyperreality that may not appeal to every viewer.Adrien Brody plays a substitute teacher who embarks on a one month assignment at a struggling public high school.  The students are alternately disaffected, disconnected, and/or outright confrontational.  The film has a multi-media quality (with occasional voice over, animation sequences, and kinetic editing) that helps to establish a rather unsettling mood.  Brody has weathered a difficult childhood, glimpsed in quick cuts, and is able to understand the silent cries for approval and recognition from the student body and his fellow staff.  While he is supposed to be detached, it is this very calm that actually makes him stand out as a survivor and a positive role model.  The longer he stays, the more influence he exerts (however inadvertently).  It's an interesting idea, one that works in a very tangible way.  \"Detachment\" makes no bones in creating high school as a modern hell.  Whether Marcia Gay Harden is writhing on the floor of her office, Tim Blake Nelson is imagining that he is invisible, or Christina Hendricks is being assaulted--these moments have a visceral impact even as they might not always have real world believability.  \"Detachment,\" in my estimation, is a well constructed but overwrought parable about the decay and hopelessness inherent in our schools.Brody is a primary selling point here.  The other names in the cast (which also includes Blythe Danner, William Peterson, Lucy Liu, Bryan Cranston, and James Caan) all have showy moments, but this is largely Brody's show.  He is both hard-edged and surprisingly likable, his unflappability has enormous appeal.  I didn't love a subplot involving a young girl from the streets (it creates a scenario that, if challenged, would have ended any potential career in education), but it is effective in creating a fully rounded persona.  I know some might proclaim \"Detachment\" a modern masterpiece.  I'm not quite there, however, although it is definitely an experience I'd recommend to serious minded film lovers.  The film is, perhaps, too arty and stylized for its own good.  Sometimes power can be achieved through simplicity as well.  Not a perfect film, but surely a memorable one.  You don't want to believe this is where we've ended up, but \"Detachment\" strikes very close to home.  KGHarris, 9/12."
B007CGLRWA Teacher character, played by Adrien Brody, is not the typical one seen in these types of story.  In general I like these inner-city-schools type movies and this one pleasantly surprised with an original perspective.  Recommend,"
B007CGLRWA Don't watch this if you're feeling suicidal or looking for laughs or light entertainment.  &#34;Detachment&#34; focuses on a public high school populated by kids who are not interested in education, to say the least, and teachers and administrators who are so beaten down by the foul-mouthed, disrespectful students and their uncaring parents that they can't function anymore.  Into this hell walks a substitute teacher played by Adrian Brody, with psychological issues of his own, who speaks to them at their level and tries to make a small difference in their lives.  A+ performances by Brody, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Marsha Gay Harden, Blythe Danner, and others.  But definitely a downer.  It's been many, many years since I've been in school and I hope it's not this horrific nowadays."
B007CGLRWA To begin:  the first third of the movie is out of synch which almost had me turn it off and ask for my money back.  But I stuck with it, although it should be fixed, and am I ever glad I did.This is a beautiful, and also a heartbreaking film.  Adrian Brody has the most soulful eyes and is superb in this film.The story is not very new, but it's approach is different.I felt a lot of empathy for each character.It is not for the faint of heart, for it has quite a few very difficult situations presented.But it's not exploitative at all.Rather it is tender.  Yes, tender.  And you feel for these people as if they were you and yours."
B007CGLRWA This screenplay, written by Carl Lund with intriguingly gloomy photography and daunting direction by Tony Kaye, makes \"Detachment\" more of a difficult character analysis than just another burnt-out teacher and his insurgent class of students movie. The intensely dark story of Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody), who is hired by the New York inner-city public school system as a substitute teacher for the course of one month, can be quite shocking and depressing.  What does commence during this short amount of time could fill volumes with its content.Along with Mr. Barthes is a smattering of other teachers and their predicaments which are touched on, but not fully developed.  This is absolutely Henry Barthes' story altogether. Principal Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden) is grappling with her own feelings of inadequacy as she is being forced out of her position.  The Guidance Counselor, Dr. Parker (Lucy Liu), is suffering severe burnout from students not caring about their lives, and she is unable to help them any longer. Fellow teacher, Charles Seaboldt (James Caan), has more of a sarcastic attitude, and an alcohol and drug fueled disposition mainly because he no longer cares.  Among the other teachers is Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson, and Christina Hendricks, each with their own agendas in overwhelming situations concerning the aggressive and combative students.Use of the cutaway photography inserts flashes of Barthes' past along with his plugged-in, hushed narrative and added animated scenes serve the movie well. They show a very disturbing upbringing that doesn't completely let the viewer know what has happened.  We inherently know that he had suffered very much which appears traumatic while young and still continues with his shut down emotions. He is a quiet, reclusive person that takes the time to visit his grandfather in an assisted living facility, who seems to be suffering from a kind of dementia and does not recognize him most of the time.  He is most likely his only family member and Henry is insistent that his care never be neglected.  Aside from one other person, he is his only source of any human connection. This is not a mutual relationship for Henry due to his grandfather's inconsistent memory of him.From the beginning of teaching at the school, Mr. Barthes is easily in charge taking no guff from the confrontational students and showing his no ifs, ands, or buts, exterior.  They cannot pull the wool over his eyes even though it may be the reason they even attend class.  There is one young lady present who is obviously bullied by her classmates, Meredith (Betty Kaye), who takes too much interest in Henry because he treats her with respect and kindness, so she, in turn, begins obsessing about him.  Around this time in the film, Henry meets a young prostitute, Erica (Sami Gayle in a standout performance).  Having no place to stay, being roughed up and ill, she pulls sympathy from Henry despite his own broken feelings and usual apathy.  Her naivete concerning a man's motives and overwhelming vulnerability piques his kindness toward her, so she moves in with Henry directly after spending the night.  They begin an aloofly  platonic relationship while Erica heals from injuries and acclimates herself to his apartment.  She has been abused on the streets, treated cruelly and takes a little time to realize that Henry can be her friend without having to do anything to or for him.  At first their ages gave me a reason for pause, although it was quickly reconciled, then made the boundaries quite clear.Possibly grounded in reality, the movie is extremely intense, taut, gut wrenching, and playing with the boundaries.  There is no discipline with the students who feel entitled to do whatever they please, including physically assaulting the teachers.  This is not a feel good movie and is very stingy with any warmth.  One could say the classrooms are scenes during wartime and collectively it would be fair to call the whole school a Warzone.  Aptly titled, \"Detachment\" describes Mr. Barthes' own separation from his emotions that he cannot show or feel, the schism between teachers and students, the teachers themselves who have to disconnect to protect themselves from certain emotional and/or physical abuse, and the student's inability to curb their aggression and angst. The first time I viewed this film, I could only make it about half of the way through then continued it on another night.  It affected me so much that I could not shake-off all of the feelings it brought up in me.  I have now watched this three times, and it really did not get any easier.  It depends on how much a movie may affect you to choose this film.  This would be one film that I still would have to prepare for to view again.  It is that well acted, that realistic to get under your skin, and that effective.  Unlike any other movie I have seen in this venue, it gets its point across, and that is something that hasn't left me still."
B007CGLRWA \"Some of us believe we can make a difference, then we wake up and realize we failed.\" Henry Barthes (Brody) is a substitute teacher who is all but dead inside. His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need, but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and \"fix\" the students. Even including the true stories \"Dangerous Minds\" and \"Lean On Me\" this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's, nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone \"gets it\". This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis, most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see, and every high school kid who thinks he is a \"thug\" needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education. Another movie that deserves to be noticed and seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I highly recommend this movie. I give this an A+."
B007CGN1JM The acting is at the very highest level. Of course it's only enhanced by perfect costumes and sets. I won't spoil the plot needless to say FUNNY!"
B007CGN1JM AH, English comedies. I may be sucker for period pieces but this series from 1983 (I think) matches 2 great English actresses, Geraldine McEwen and Prunella Scales.Miss McEwen went on to appear as one ofthe Miss Marple's in Agatha Christie's stories on Masterpiece Mystery. And Prunella Scales was in Faulty Towers. You'll love them in this comedy."
B007CGN1JM 5 stars I love it and can watch it over and over it never gets boring. To funny for words actually."
B007CGN1JM I have loved Mapp @ Lucia from the very first time I bought the VHS version. I had never seen it offered on DVD, so I was totally delighted to find it on Amazon Instant Video. What joy!!  All of the actors play their roles to perfection.  I have also read the entire original series of Lucia books by E.F. Benson. I do recommend those books to fans who want to experience more of Lucia 's world. Sadly, the series did not delve into the Riseholme world. That is a shame. But I am very happy with what we do have of some of the keenest social satire of the British middle /upper - middle class of the early 20th century."
B007CGN1JM If you like the old Brit Coms this series is bound to please. It has old cars from the era, and the costumes are outstanding. At times it can be a little corny, but its worth viewing."
B007CUQ82A I liked the series, but it was incomplete. Nothing was explored regarding the Magna Carta and Charles II who lost the colonies isn't even mentioned. I'm not sure it would stand up to much scrutiny."
B007CUQ82A I originally started watching this on NetFlix, but then they expired it. I was happy when I found it again on Prime. Then Amazon pulled it off of Prime, and I am not paying $2.99 per episode for a history lesson. For a Prime selection, it was good. I enjoyed it. But there's just not enough value in it to make me pay."
B007CUQ82A ~Sadly, many will consider this is true history but it's not!It's pathetic what is put into gullible minds as fact when the actual history is so much more interesting.Queen Mary was a Caucasian with red/auburn hair. That is an important part of true history because when the executor overheads her he had no ideal by that time in her life she was wearing a wig & when he went to hold up her severed head for the crowd her head fell out & he was left holding the red wig.Also, the good-looking Prince/king was no were near being the stud portrayed. Facts are he was very slight in size, had a deformity, & was always sickly.It's no wonder our children (USA) are so behind in school compared to so many other countries watching this FICTION believing it's true.Had this been a show with fictional characters I would have enjoyed it."
B007CUQ82A They love their kings and queens and it shows up here.  This series cleared up some questions I had about the various &#34;wars&#34; nice to get it at last."
B007CUQ82A If you are a history buff or if you like reading about the Monarch's of England, whether it be a history book or Historical Fiction, this show is for you. It is narrated and has reenactments. The reenactments have a boring aspect to them but, you can learn a lot from it. So if you'd like to watch a show about a Monarch you find interesting before buying that Historical Fiction book, this show is for you. There were some Monarchs I knew nothing about or never heard of. You will definately learn some new material in each episode!!"
B007CUQ82A This is a long winded narration of the history of the monarchy.  although it provides alot factual information, there is little visual information to clue you in as to why the homes or areas being discussed are important.  If you're a history buff, this will be boring.  If you want to learn, you may wind up fast forwarding thru some of it."
B007EMEG52 A waste of time and $.  Don't fall for this one.  I didn't mind the waste of $1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time.  =("
B007EMEG52 If you are interested in history, this is a good show. Maybe sometimes, too many negative things. Fast moving. Easy 22 minutes."
B007EMEG52 This is a show I look forward to.  It's light hearted, gives interesting, obscure information on different subject matter that I didn't know the facts presented.  It's fun."
B007EMEG52 There is a lot of information on public figures of our past. People tend to put certain people on a pedestal, but they forget of the other things they also did, some not so nice or brave."
B007EMEG52 I liked this program because it shows there is always another side to people and things we put on pedestals.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more of the truth about an individual or religion.  Because the whole truth will never be in the history books.  Very interesting and informative."
B007EMEG52 Wow. I thought I was going to watch an interesting historical series and learn some new things about some historical figures.  I tried to watch two different episodes, one on Ben Franklin and one on Abraham Lincoln.  I felt like I was watching TMZ!  Honestly, sensationalistic poo!!  I looked up the \"historian\" who narrates this program and discovered that names of 2 novels he had written: one entitled \"Gay Power: An American Revolution\" and the other entitled \"One Nation Under Sex\" which he co-wrote with...wait for it...Larry Flynt!! Yeah.  That pretty much tells me what kind of \"history\" this man is interested in.  This show literally turned my stomach.  Very disappointing.  Unfortunately, this is what some think of as entertainment in our dumbed-down, sewer-minded society."
B007G5GMMC Why do I give it 3 stars?It's a very well made movie, don't get me wrong and acting was good, the set looked good too, the plot wasn't bad in fact and humans were depicted in it's best (it's worst), when money decide lives of animals and people. So why 3 stars, you ask? Because first it got me really confused when they showed am extinct species and then they shot them. ''-Hey it's the last animal of these species on Earth. -Ah, let's just kill it.'' I really was buffled, because I couldn't tell whether it was a real animal (main animal of the movie) or not. I don't care what they say in titles, I bet it isn't always true. But that is one. I am against killing animals in any shapes or forms with any kind of behavior or level of danger. That is two. And finally, what good of an ending does it have? It doesn't have a good ending! What does this ending mean? That a man judged an animal and how it lived and on that judgement thought it was better off dead. Well thank you very much, but a positive ending would do much better not just to a movie itself but also to people who watch it. Let's face it, some people learn more from the movies. So why not? Is it easier to believe in bad things happening in the end because they seem more real? Is it so hard to believe in good things? This is precisely why humanity is so screwed up in general! The movie did nothing to change things it just showed all the dark poop our ancestors got us into. I bet these animals were amazing. If any of these species would still exist I would take part in helping them, but thanks to the movie it just motivated more people into killing them. It doesn't matter whether out of good (like in this movie, it was supposed to be good to kill the last animal of 'that' kind) or bad motives (money)."
B007G5GMMC This is one of those movies that just doesn't go and or do anything.  It just lies there, dormant and motionless until the credits roll and your eyes readjust to the light.  What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose, and even the approach (restraint as opposed to abrasiveness) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome.  The base plot feels almost silly, never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed.  The characters are skeletons, the revelations are minute and t
B007G5GMMC This film was not as I expected.It was dark, dreary, sad in content and exercution and ultimately depressing.The performances however were excellent.."
B007G5GMMC The Hunter is a fine, fine film.It saddens me to see that so much of today's movie-going audience can tolerate nothing but explosions, gratuitous violence, chase-scenes, big name actors, CGI, and nudity. The future of film-making is not with Hollywood. Hollywood is dying. It is with is with people like Benh Zeitlen (Beasts Of The Southern Wild), and Shane Carruth (Primer). It is in Norway, France, Britain, Korea, China, New Zealand, and Australia.The Hunter is a slow-burning, captivating arthouse film whose pros and cons are shown below:1. Cinematography - 5 STARSThe cinematography and scope of this film can only be described as stunning. Truly, truly, beautiful. Gorgeous. Breathtaking. Awe-Inspiring. Mystical. Mysterious. Haunting. Desolate. Tasmania is a wild, primeval land, untamed by man, and The Hunter captures it in it's rawest, most ancient form - untouched, and untainted. The helicopter shots will fill you with wonder and awe, in the same way that the land of New Zealand stunned you in The Lord of the Rings. The Hunter is worth watching for the cinematography alone.2. Acting - 5 Stars.In The Hunter, plot takes back seat to acting. And what great acting it is.Willem Dafoe plays Martin David, a mercenary hired by a secretive USA military company to hunt down the last remaining Thylacine, a.k.a. \"Tasmanian Tiger.\" Dafoe's performance commands your attention. It quietly rivets you to the screen. Oftentimes the camera will stay stationary, focusing on Dafoe skinning an animal or rigging a trap. The Hunter allows great actors to do their \"thing\". It is most effective as a film when we follow Dafoe into the wilderness of Tasmania. He is the only character on the screen. It's just us and him. His performance is riveting, commanding, and laconic. The role slips on to Dafoe like an old, well worn glove. An intriguing, riveting character, in an intriguing, riveting film.In the supporting cast we find Frances O'Connor, (A.I. Artificial Intelligence, The Importance of Being Earnest) a talented Anglo-Australian actress, and Sam Neill (The Hunt for Red October, Jurassic Park), who inhabits his role of a dodgy local guide. The performances are low-key - never showy, never over played, but very  believable, dramatic portraits of real people.3. Story - 4 StarsSlow moving, thoughtful, intense, but occasionally predictable. The story is the weakest link in this film. No shocking twists or turns, no OTT action violence (when it comes, the action is cool, brutal, realistic, and real), no explosions, just thoughtful, suspenseful, slow-burning plot. There is a brilliant twist that happens near the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you, but let me just say that it involves some excellent CGI and a moving performance by Willem Dafoe.In conclusion, The Hunter is a slow moving, quiet, thought provoking, psychological drama/thriller. If you are in for an easy watch, skip this one.If you are in for beautiful, haunting cinematography, excellent acting - starring a towering performance from Willem Dafoe, suspense, atmosphere, drama, and heart, then watch The Hunter.I wish there were more films like it."
B007G5GMMC I liked what I saw, but if I can't stay awake, I figure it was missing something.  In this case.... it was the end."
B007G5GMMC I just finished watching this movie, I thought it was fairly good, but I was not planning on writing a review until I came here and read some of the negative reviews (I like to read reviews after watching a movie to see what other people thought). After reading the negative reviews I have a desire to respond briefly to the two major complaints that people seemed to have with the movie, 1) that it was boring, and 2) that the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character was not believable. Before I respond to those critiques, however, my conscience forces me to provide at least a brief summary of the movie and why I thought it was worth watching, in order to justify the fact that I am writing a review at all.The movie is about a hunter, played by Willem Dafoe, who is hired by a corporation to track down the last remaining Tasmanian Tiger in order to retrieve its DNA, and possibly a toxin that it uses to subdue or kill its prey. Dafoe's character is a loner, but when in Tasmania he is forced to stay with a family. The mother of the family is distraught over the recent disappearance of her husband and spends all her time sleeping, but Dafoe interacts with her two children, a daughter and a son. The movie moves back and forth between scenes with Dafoe on his own in the woods trying to track the Tasmanian Tiger, and scenes with him interacting with the family. There is also a conflict between environmentalists, who are attempting to get a ban placed on logging in the area, and the loggers who are threatened with unemployment if the environmentalists succeed. Dafoe's character gets caught in the middle of the conflict because the loggers take him to be a \"greenie\".That is a basic description of what the movie is about, and I must admit, when I read the description the movie did not sound all that exciting to me. The movie managed, however, to hold my interest once I started watching. This is not an action movie, there are not a lot of tense action sequences. In fact, there are none. That may be why so many people thought the movie was boring. If you are looking for a Rambo style action flick than I would definitely recommend taking a pass on this movie. There are other things besides action, however, that make a movie interesting and engaging, and this movie does a good job at setting up a number of mysteries that hook in the viewer. What happened to the father who disappeared? Who is responsible for setting up the camera, and other hanging objects, in the woods? Is there really still a Tasmanian Tiger out there, or is it really extinct? There is also the whole conflict between the environmentalists and the loggers which threatens to explode and creates tension in the movie. And, of course, there is the heart of the movie: Dafoe's relationship with the family, and especially the kids. All in all, I would not consider this to be one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it certainly held my interest, and it was a lot better than most of the movies that get made these days.Now I will try to quickly respond to the two complaints. I have already responded, to some degree, to the first complaint that the film is boring. The pace of the movie is slow, that is undeniable. If you do not like slow paced movies than you should not watch this one. But like I said, there is plenty in the movie that is capable of grabbing and holding the viewer's interest despite its lack of action packed car chases.The second complaint that everyone seems to have with this movie is that Dafoe's character arc is not believable. This complaint was made not only by reviewer's here on amazon, but also by professional reviewers on the site Rotten Tomatoes. I find this complaint somewhat puzzling because it seems to me to be based on a false premise. I think people find the character arc unbelievable because they make the character's transformation more extreme than it really is. They often talk as if Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie was an evil loner, perhaps an assassin type character, and that at the end of the movie he is a fully reformed character. There is, however, as far as I can tell nothing in the movie that would suggest that Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie is in any way \"evil\", unless you assume that anyone who is willing to work for a corporation, or anyone who hunts for a living is \"evil\". There is also no indication that the character is a saint by the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ PAST THIS SENTENCE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING REVEALED.In fact, the character still kills the Tasmanian Tiger once he finds it. The character does, however, refuse to give the remains to the corporation, and I read one review by a professional critic who considered that completely unbelievable. I do not think there is anything unbelievable about it at all. The company that Dafoe's character was working for had just murdered the woman he was staying with, along with her daughter, or, it is at least clear that Dafoe believes that the corporation was responsible for their deaths (he says to Sam Neill's character \"they just sent a replacement for me...\"). What would have been unbelievable is if Dafoe's character had been so heartless as to continue working for his previous employers once it became clear they were willing to murder innocent people to get what they wanted. There is nothing in the set up of Willem Dafoe's character which would suggest that he is fine with killing innocent people.I just do not think that the character transformation is as large as these critics are assuming. There is, of course, a character transformation, but I think it is from someone who is extremely solitary to someone who begins to show a minimal interest in other people's lives. That is not really a giant leap in my opinion. I think Dafoe's transformation is entirely believable given the circumstances (I apologize that I keep referring to the character by using the name of the actor but I am too lazy to look up the character name). It would be hard to stay with a family whose father/husband had just gone missing and not feel some sympathy, especially for the children. You would have to be inhuman not to, and like I said, there is no reason to believe that Dafoe's character is inhuman at the beginning of the movie or incapable of human sympathy. The fact that he spends his time listening to opera suggests that he is a human being who is quite capable of feeling genuine human emotions. He is not a sociopath. So, contrary to what so many people seem to think, I do not find anything unbelievable in the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character. Personally, I do not think that \"realism\" should be the primary ideal of art. What would be the point of an art-work that was just a carbon copy of reality? I did not, however, see anything in this movie that I thought stretched the bounds of believability beyond a reasonable point. In fact, I would say this is probably one of the more realistic movies I have ever seen. Certainly much more realistic than most Hollywood blockbusters.Whether you will like this movie will, however, depend on your tastes."
B007G5GMMC This is a lean adventure film with a measured pace set in the rarely seen Tasmania starring the ageless and ever worth-watchingWilliem Dafoe and supported by a group of able real-life-looking actors.  It is satisfying to watch a well-thought-through film with a good story and A not disappointing ending these days.  If you are not expecting an action adventure but a drama with a good theme then you will not be disappointed.  I would rate it 3 1/2 stars."
B007G5GMMC A well played Drama by Mr. Dafoe who sadly realized in the end the only alternative which was very sad.  Shows what we as a society have come to in protecting the environment and the life it supports."
B007G5GMMC This Australian film moves from interesting (a lone hunter out to bag the last Tasmanian tiger) to so unsatisfying that a person might wish he'd spent his time more productively, like washing the car.Martin David (Willem Dafoe), an unhappy, taciturn loner, is hired by a mysterious corporation to go to Tasmania and take tissue and blood samples from the one remaining Tasmanian tiger. He'll have to kill it first, of course. When he arrives he finds unfriendly men, a perhaps too helpful but cautious Jack Mindy (Sam Neill) and a conflict between those who want to log ancient trees for jobs and those who want to save the forests. His base is a broken down and eccentrically decorated wooden house with a mother passed out from drugs and drink and her two kids, one a precocious pre-teen and the other a young boy who doesn't speak, only draws. They are cutely named Sass and Bike. The husband has been missing in the forests for a month or two.Martin David prowls through the Tasmanian forests seeking evidence of where the Tasmanian devil lurks. He sets steel traps (illegal), gazes at the beautiful scenery, looks more and more conflicted, and eventually realizes that the corporation has more than one hunter after the animal.And then the movie goes flat, manipulative and becomes deeply unsatisfying. There are good tree huggers victimized by rowdy loggers (there's a message for us), predictable betrayal, the utterly unnecessary deaths of two sympathetic characters, and a conclusion that is sticky with sentiment on the one hand and unethical on the other. If we have to destroy a village to save it, Martin David, with a new, mystical appreciation of nature, is the man to hire. Dafoe, however, gives an engrossing performance."
B007G5GMMC Willem Dafoe is without a doubt one of my favorite actors. From his cross-dressing FBI agent in Boondock Saints to the Green Goblin in Spider-Man, he always owns whatever role he takes on. For The Hunter, he plays a mercenary named Martin David who's sent by a bio-technology firm to collect the previously thought to be extinct Tasmanian tiger. This is the perfect kind of role for the actor who's performance demands attention as the film centers on Martin and his adventure in the Australian wilderness.From the start it's clear that Martin is a seasoned veteran from the way he quickly turns down assistance at the beginning of his assignment to the cool and controlled manner in which he handles his gear. He's always in control, always thinking three steps ahead. These are the kind of characters I enjoy in a movie, loners who automatically emit a sense of undeniable coolness.Martin is not welcomed in the logging town. Locals are rugged and hostile, used to treehuggers and foreigners causing trouble in their town. Because of his reception, Martin immediately senses something is not quite right. Further, it's learned that the family of whom he is renting a room from during his trip has some secrets that make Martin all the more suspicious. As he closes in on the elusive animal, the pressure rises in terms of him returning results to his employer as well as finding answers to the growing number of questions building in his mind.The film moves at a fairly slow pace, starting out with Martin in the snowy forest, tracking his prey. I appreciated the simplicity and Zen-like nature of the scenery. Characters need to have a certain level of depth to pull in interest from an audience when they are solely on the screen for a majority of the movie, and Dafoe certainly gives it to Martin. Though not a lot  happens during his treks into the woods, I was hanging onto each scene wondering what was going to happen next and found myself drawn to Martin's story.There's a sub-plot involving the aforementioned family Martin is staying with that provides a nice change of pace. The mother Lucy (France O'Connor) is slowly awakening from a drug-induced slumber, partially due to Martin's arrival and the spirit he brings into her house and the affect he has on the two children especially. This is where we're reminded that Martin is a human, not a soulless machine. The film manages to tie in this story without stooping to the level of adding a predictable and unrealistic romance into the picture. The scenes involving the family feel honest and natural.The Hunter seemed like it would be a nice stylish adventure flick when I first heard of it, and it did turn out to be that way. The pacing does seem to drag on at times, but after the film was over I was kind of glad it did. I got to feel personal with Martin, which made the story as a whole more interesting and meaningful. The beautiful snowy wilderness worked perfectly with the dark and mysterious story. The characters seemed authentic and were captured perfectly through a wonderful cast.Though I found myself a few times wanting it to get to the point during its rather average runtime, my patience paid off. The synopsis may have all the signs of a macho actioner, but The Hunter is deemed a solid example of an exciting story that doesn't have to rely on the old cliches of sex and glorified violence. This may let down a few viewers, but those seeking for an adventure with more emotion than explosion, this is one to watch.Source: criticnic.com 17-July-2012Disclosure: Film sent by Magnolia Pictures"
B007G5GMMC Willem Dafoe is one of those actors that always manages to sucker punch you with how much talent he really has. Most people know him for his portrayal of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin in \"Spider-Man\" or Paul Smecker in \"The Boondock Saints\" and others probably don't even realize that he did voice work in \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" or motion capture work in \"John Carter.\" Dafoe has a pretty impressive resume under his belt that covers all film genres. \"The Hunter\" slowly brings out the best in him. His emotions bide their time until the final act where they bubble up to the surface. The performance is expertly crafted by Dafoe and it quickly becomes evident that not many others could aspire to do as good of a job as he's done here.The rest of the main cast is pretty impressive, as well. Morgana Davies never seems to stop talking while Finn Woodlock never says a word at all and expresses his emotions through his facial features, his eyes, and a particular drawing he attempts on several occasions to give to Willem Dafoe's Martin. Frances O'Connor is a mother who's just fallen on hard times since her husband disappeared. She wants what's best for her kids and yet seems to only be punishing herself. Finally, there's Sam Neill who's on the same page as Dafoe when it comes to under-appreciated actors. Neill seems to accomplish just as much emotionally in his short screen time that Dafoe does the entire picture. It's really bizarre hearing Neill talk with an Australian accent though.The highlight of the film is its cinematography. It really brings out the best in the Tasmanian outback. The Australian wilderness is so lush and beautiful. Sometimes it's difficult to believe such secluded places still exist in this world, but \"The Hunter\" throws you right out into it; on your own just like Martin. Waterfalls, gorgeous landscapes, and nothing but greenery as far as the eye can see, \"The Hunter\" boasts some of the best cinematography of the year.The finale is a bit of a double edged sword as there are some really great moments in there that are unprecedented as far as the rest of the year in film goes and some that just don't sit well with you. Something big takes place off screen and two factors of the equation are taken away and never seen again from that point on. It feels kind of cheap, especially the way the story was progressing.There's also minimal CGI used; when it's first used, it looks really good but then it's like the film gets overzealous and uses too much of a good thing. With that said, the finale is where Dafoe's performance is at its peak along with the importance of a particular item he's found on his journey. The music accompanied with the final scene is perhaps the most powerful ending so far this year. It's just extraordinary.\"The Hunter\" is the most intriguing thriller to come along in the first half of 2012. Willem Dafoe continues to showcase why he's one of the best actors today as the camera work for the film is absolutely breathtaking. Despite its very few shortcomings, \"The Hunter\" is well worth going through all the trouble of tracking down yourself.Special features include Making of The Hunter, Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary) (6:36), Commentary with director Daniel Nettheim and Producer Vincent Sheehan, and the theatrical trailer. The making of feature is broken down into four featurettes: The Story (3:25), The Characters (17:48), Tasmania (7:38), and The Tiger (3:52).If the special features to a film are done right, they can help you appreciate the film even more. Even if you didn't like it, you can at least appreciate the amount of work filmmakers put into a film or the explanations for a character's action or story point could perhaps help swerve your opinion a bit. Although there aren't many special features here, they still manage to engross you even further into an already absorbing project.\"The Hunter\" will be released on single disc DVD and single disc Blu-ray by Magnolia Pictures on Tuesday, July 3rd. The DVD is presented in widescreen with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. It's available in English with Spanish subtitles. The film is rated R for language and brief violence and is approximately 102 minutes long."
B007G5GMMC Like many films of its sort, THE HUNTER isn't for everyone.  It's not a survivalist film, or an action film, though it has elements of both.  Really, it's a character study of the main character: Martin David, a contract hunter whose latest assignment is to travel Australia and kill what may be the last Tasmanian tiger, a species thought extinct.  Once there, David finds himself living with Lucy, a drug-addled widow, and her two children.  As David hunts his tiger, and grows closer to this odd family, his presence causes trouble with the locals, while back home, his employers are growing impatient.Willem Dafoe is the anchor here.  Even when the film meanders (and the viewer's attention with it), Dafoe remains stellar, giving one of his more nuanced performances.  Frances O'Connor is solid as well, in what little she has to do; and Sam Neill, as a local, gives a fantastic performance (one wonders what the film would've been like with Neill in the lead role...but hey, Dafoe's great, so let's not wonder too much).  The cinematography is top-notch (THE HUNTER was filmed on location, and said location is absolutely beautiful), and the direction is solid.The problem here is the script.  I haven't read the source novel, so we'll leave author Julia Leigh out of this.  But the script as filmed, courtesy of Alice Addison and Wain Fimeri, has many holes.  The movie is about David's emotional isolation (reflected in his choice of career); yet he takes to Lucy and her children with little hesitation (what hesitation there is being of a moral sort, as when the kids immediately jump in the bathtub with him).  We can understand Lucy and the children's attachment to him; but there is little to explain why he returns their devotion.  The climactic scene hints at such, but the buildup to it doesn't offer an explanation.  It's a glaring error, and weighs the film down.  Still, THE HUNTER is a fine film, and worth checking out, for the performances and cinematography if nothing else."
B007G5GMMC This is especially good if you have spent time in the wilderness.  Any wilderness.  Beautifully and hauntingly done.  Glad I watched it."
B007G5GMMC While \"The Hunter\" will prove too slow-moving and anti-climactic for many tastes (a tense action drama 'tis not), it is a thoughtful, mood-provoking film that includes a stunning visit to a part of the world (Tasmania) that is quite unfamiliar to most non-Australians. The whole mood is somber and virtually humorless, with subtle layers of conflict, intelligent pacing that imitates real life but will leave many viewers raring for more to happen, and some quiet, unexpected turnabouts towards the end. Good acting by just about all, most particularly Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock as the kids, who prove to be the most unique and memorable characters here. The \"Deleted Scenes\"--some of which maybe should have been left in--are worth a look."
B007G5GMMC I enjoyed this movie and the premise of how corrupt the world we live in that we would kill each other just for fame.  His choice in the movie was sad, but I cannot get it out of my mind.  Great Job in bringing me into the mind of a hunter not only of the wild but of man's soul. Great One.  (SPOILER ALERT) The bath scene was a little disturbing but compasionate to my fatherly sensibilities.  I hugged my son tight hoping I inspire him as their father inspired them to love life together as a family."
B007G5GMMC If you look hard enough, you can find truly great mysteries across the variety of film genres.  They've long been the province of historical fiction or period pieces looking back at some treacherous point in history.  Thrillers often wrap up one or several enigmas within their dark, elusive characters.  Science fiction tackles them by revealing the world hidden beneath.  Character dramas - much like director Daniel Nettheim's THE HUNTER - occasionally scramble to place the pieces amongst the various players and subplots, but this effortless adaptation based on Julia Leigh's novel of the same name could serve as a textbook example of how to do it and do it well.Martin David (played by screen veteran Willem Dafoe) is a mercenary, using his unique set of skills to benefit corporations seeking elusive genetic material.  Contacted by the mysterious Red Leaf Company, he's hired to secure a `sample' of the neurotoxin contained in the venom of the Tasmanian Tiger.  The problem?  The tiger is long thought to have been extinct.  However, as fate would have it, rare sightings have stretched across the Tasmanian wild.  Once David travels to Tasmania posing as a university scientist investigating the rumors, he uncovers what may be several conspiracies, all pointing toward a single truth he may not be willing to accept.THE HUNTER is a gem of a movie, one part thriller, one part mystery, one part very soft sci-fi, and definitely two parts noir.  Dafoe's tight-lipped craftsman lives his existence sterilely; in his home at the beginning, we're shown his immaculately white counters with his toiletries lain out with specific precision.  Suddenly, he's thrust into a dirty, broken-down farmhouse where a despondent widow, Lucy Armstrong (Frances O'Connor), languishes her days doped up in bed while her two young children (Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock) eek out their day-to-day existence with little to no parental guidance.  Out of necessity, the loner forces himself into the role as a surrogate `adult,' and, as he grows more attached to the three of them, he learns that they all may be on a same dangerous path when the forces of nature and industrial espionage collide.The performances are all exceptional.  Dafoe long ago mastered the grim, brooding outsider in the days of Oliver Stone's PLATOON, and it's matured nicely here.  His dogged determination to uncover the truth is matched by his commitment as a predator in pursuit of his prey, and he carries the weight of the tale here with great effectiveness.  Another veteran, Sam Neill, appears as a local tracker named Jack Mindy, and, while his involvement in possible earlier searches for the tiger is never made perfectly clear, the actor gets solid mileage out of his several scenes.  O'Connor as the broken widow moves easily between her various influences - mother, possible love interest, new-age mystic - and her ability to wear several hats serves the story greatly.  The story never quite establishes what drove her to the polar opposites of her performance (`participant' versus `pawn' versus `victim'), and she straddles that ambiguity in a way that keeps the viewer guessing.Though there are a few narrative `hiccups' that could've been ironed out to greater clarity (i.e. the true relationship of Jack Mindy to the Red Leaf; a better understanding of Lucy Armstrong's real motivation with Martin David; how much to the children know about their father's disappearance; etc.), they pale in comparison to the modestly layered and driven story at the heart of THE HUNTER.  There's an awful lot going on here - from corporate shenanigans to double-crosses, from jaded intimacy to concerns over ecology - but the script balances it all exceedingly well.  There are several mysteries at play- each of them keeping Dafoe's David questioning the ruggedness of the physical and emotional terrain - and they all serve to keep the viewer's interest, all the way up until our hero grapples with his last, fateful decision and the consequences it'll unleash: to do the unthinkable and live with the consequences OR to embrace his newly uncovered humanity and live with THOSE consequences instead.THE HUNTER is produced by Magnolia Pictures and Screen Australia in association with Screen NSW, Screen Tasmania, Fulcrum Media Finance, Madman Entertainment, and Entertainment One.  DVD distribution is being handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  The picture looks and sounds wonderful; the director of photography Robert Humphreys has captured some magnificent vistas in the Tasmanian wild, as well as some sacred, dark corners of the countryside rumored (in the film) to hold the last of its kind tiger.  Special features include a `making of' featurette, deleted scenes (with commentary), a commentary track for the picture, and the theatrical trailer; it's a terrific collection to match the investment of story and characters here.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  I always knew that the face of the man dispatched to kill of last of any living species would have to be one that looked like Willem Dafoe, and THE HUNTER confirms my long held suspicion; but it does so in a way that surprises the viewer by presenting the cold, cunning, and calculating killer as a patient yet troubled soul almost desperate to hide his own fragile humanity trapped beneath that ragged, leathery exterior.  Step by step, THE HUNTER is forced to see the world around him for what it is - precious, with some secrets worthy of being kept - and that may mean accepting the stark reality: be willing to become the prey instead of always serving as mankind's gifted predator.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener copy of THE HUNTER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B007G5GMMC For some reason I hesitated watching this film even though I'd heard some good things about it. I finally screened it and I was upset it took me as long as it did. I liked this movie a lot.Here's the scoop. Martin (Willem Dafoe) is a hunter/tracker hired by some big bucks to track, hunt and kill what might be the last Tasmanian Tiger in existence. He heads to Tasmania, but the area he's bound for is embroiled in conflict between conservationists ('Greenies'), who want to save the trees, and the locals who depend on forestry for their economy. He ends up staying with a woman and her two kids whose husband, a Greenie, disappeared the prior year in the same area Martin will be working. This association causes Martin to re-think his life.This is a beautifully shot film. The landscapes are breathtaking and the overhead shots give the impression of being on some other world. The music score is very dreamy and augments that sensation. They also inject a couple of songs (some classical, some pop) that happen at great moments and help break up the scored pieces. Willem Dafoe is his usual good self. He wears his years well and with a certain weariness. He seems genuine as you watch him use his tools to track and set various traps. I like the way his relationship with the mother and her children develops. Neither he nor she is rushing into anything, but the kids are a hoot and sort of make things happen. There is also intrigue here. The rub with the locals along with the fact that he might be being followed give rise to tension as things proceed. I've long grown tired of Sam Neill but he's aging well and he plays this smallish part well. Frances O'Connor just has one of those faces I can gawk at for hours. I guess she did a good job. I couldn't stop drooling long enough to tell.Some could argue, strongly, that the message was a bit heavy-handed. I can't disagree but the point needs to be made strongly. With all the magnificent beauty that surrounds us, what could compel someone to want to destroy any part of it? This is a heck of a flick that needs to be seen by everyone."
B007G5GMMC Interesting to read previous reviews.  I can't say I agree with any of them.  I like Defoe as an actor, but an actor needs something to work with.  If you have a couple of hours to waste, or need something to put you to sleep, this will probably work."
B007G5GMMC Thylacinus cynocephalus aka Tasmanian tiger went extinct in Aussie land, Tasmania and NZ in the early 1900s and despite rewards of millions up until quite recently, there have been only a few unconfirmed sightings.This movie is taken from a novel by the same name. Unfortunately, the characterizations seemed like someone decided to toss a bunch of popular stereotypes into a bag, give it a good toss, and see what story comes out of it.The stereotypic loner assassin with high tech sniper rifle is hired by the usual big bucks pharmaceutical company to kill off the last Thylacinus but not before getting blood and tissue samples so said company can be the sole maker of a resulting super drug. Not believable.Stereotype of \"greenies\" protecting old growth forests against the loggers. Pointless subplot.Stereotype of townspeople in bar showing in your face distrust of a foreigner, in this case the assassin. Not believable.One of the townspeople happens, coincidentally, to have a similar sniper rifle and tries to kill the assassin. Also not believable.Assassin lodges in the home of a researcher, who has gone missing for months. Home is occupied by a depressed wife who can't get out of bed for months while her two very young children take care of everything. Not believable and another plot digression.Sam Neill plays a part time guide along with other roles in the movie that just seemed contrived. Pointless subplot.No flow to the storyline, just a bunch of cutout stereotypes. The only acting worth noting was by Morgana Davies whose naturalness made her character believable. Similar to her performance in \"The Tree\". So far she's hasn't been influenced by the \"Rubber Stamp Acting School\" or become a perennial stuck-in-a-rut actor."
B007G5GMMC It was a pretty good movie. Not a movie I'd watch several times but it was good enough to watch once."
B007G5GMMC I hate to give a bad review but this movie really begs for one.No plot whatsoever,I kept waiting for a story line to pop up and all I could do was scratch my head.I enjoy watching Dafoe but I wish he had passed up this role!"
B007G5GMMC Very rare to see a movie that attempts to communicate a story on more than one level.  This movie won't be for a lot of people.  But for those like myself,  who want to see the majestic, hear the sound of silence--this movie will be just perfect."
B007G5GMMC By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiThe Tasmanian Tiger once roamed mainland Australia. It's widely believed the animal is now extinct. The extinction came about from humans and invasive dingoes. The last known Tasmanian Tiger was photographed at Beaumaris Zoo in 1933.In The Hunter, Martin David (Willem Dafoe), a mercenary hunter, is hired by a military biotech company named Red Leaf. There have been two sightings of the presumably extinct Tasmanian Tiger.He is to follow up on the sightings and, if possible, recover tissue and organ samples of this rare beast.He goes to Tasmania, under the cover that he's a professor from a university.David is a loner, almost like a hit man, who finds comfort in hot baths and classical music.His lifestyle changes when he rents a room from a single mother Lucy Armstrong (Frances O'Connor) and her two young children Sass and her brother Bike.Lucy sleeps most of the time, addicted to prescription medication, because eight months earlier her environmentatlist husband Jarrah Armstorng went missing. He vanished into the same wilderness David is going into. He goes into the brush 12 days at a time, setting up assorted traps and snares trying to capture the ellusive Tasmanian Tiger.David has other problems too. Loggers don't want him around -- they think he is another environmentalist threatening their jobs.The Hunter is slow moving but really good."
B007G5GMMC Although ther were many good things about this movie, the story felt incomplete. No backstory to the main character, and the action was a little to subdued."
B007G5GMMC I was really surprised at the quality of acting by Dafoe. There was almost no dialog in this film, but you never were at a loss for what he was thinking. It was a bit slow moving, but the wonderful scenery made up for it. I very likely will watch again in 6 months or so and definitely would recommend it. I would warn though about the pace of the show. If it had moved along just a bit faster, I'd have given it 5 stars."
B007G5GMMC 3.8 starsDafoe's strangely omnipresent wide-eyed stare sits astride this film for better and for worse; I've never seen him look so confused most of the time. One supposes this is from his haunted past, but we get almost no backstory for his character, so who knows? The one certain thing in The Hunter is that it takes its time, and then some. But since much of that time is spent looking at gorgeous Tasmanian wilderness, that's fine, if you like such sights.I sure do, and seeing them in a nice blu-ray transfer helps (there's also a good doc and a few other extras on this BD). I'd never seen footage of this magnificent country before, and it is lovely. The film was shot mostly in diffuse natural light, and the wilderness scenes are as good as most nature docs, sometimes better. The Hunter is sort of an eco-fable, so it can be forgiven for lingering shots of trees and water, but it does get mighty slow plot-wise at times. Patience is required. All the acting is solid, but the script gets a bit twee at points, though the basic story is fascinating.Spoiler coming...The real payoff for me here was the moment just before Dafoe shoots the tiger (the species' name was Thylacine). The whole film leads up this moment, and when he first sees it standing there meekly, he has the expected realization that this is the last of its species, and how can one kill something so rare and lovely. But then we get a wonderful close-up of the thylacine (excellent cgi, by the way, totally believable; in the making-of doc we see the original real photos from which those shots were made very faithfully. If you look online for videos of this animal in zoos before it was made extinct by hunters, you'll see a creature that's more canine than any wolf or jackal ever was. A wonderfully adapted animal, worthy of the love we did not give it). And as it looks at us and then slowly lowers its head, I had an unexpected, strong emotional moment.If you've ever really loved a dog, you know what each movement of its head and eyes means. I had a strange and perhaps vestigial reaction when the Tasmanian tiger put its head down, and it called up so many of my saddest feelings about our species on this splendid planet. The thylacine knows that it is alone, and will never breed. It has fought to stay hidden for decades, and now one of the two-legged killers, its only enemy, has found its den. But rather than run, it stands motionless: it is sadly ready to die for once and for all.The thought of that final extinction, whether fable or fact, reminded me of why I am so often and so increasingly ashamed of we homo sapiens. We have permanently destroyed more than half of the species on this planet in barely one hundred years. We seem to have no use for anything that can not bring us money. We don't care about anything but ourselves, apparently. And in so doing we have lost and continue to lose so much of what is finest about being alive on the planet Earth: sharing its beauty and living in harmony with all beings, large and small.When that animal puts its head down, Dafoe understands perfectly. In his mind, he is killing it to prevent a biotech firm from making a poison from it, and exploiting its DNA. But on the broader scale, where money isn't the only thing that matters, he is killing the final member of yet another unique species, the thing that we homo saps are apparently best at. We certainly can't seem to live in peace with them, or ourselves, can we? And when Dafoe shoots, there is a certain grim satisfaction in knowing his metamorphosis into a caring and truly human being is complete, and that means less profits for yet another corporation for whom money rules above all other things.But the fact that a whole species is destroyed because of it (which really did happen with the Tasmanian tiger about 80 years ago), that is real tragedy deeper than any human character dying in any movie I can think of. That moment when the animal puts its head down meekly, like the last Old Yeller that will ever be, man, I just started crying out of nowhere. And it felt so very sad, like when our last dog died unexepctedly. But imagine if your dog was the last dog that would ever be.Now that is true sadness. And shame.So, for all the slowness of this film, that moment was a supreme payoff. For me, at least; I've no idea how most people would react, and I haven't seen that moment mentioned anywhere else. Yet it explains Dafoe's wide eyes to some degree, and it makes the long and often sloooow scenes leading up to it worthwhile.But how many people want to watch a man alone in the wilderness? I love being alone in the mountains, so it appeals to me, but then again I also love a plot that moves along briskly, so as a filmgoer it cut both ways here.It was however a treat to see the mostly unspoiled nature of a country I've never seen and will likely never set foot in, and the heart of this movie is a beautiful thing, as it never forces its views upon you; the loggers are never seen as all bad or the \"greenies\" as all good.Despite its various flaws, I will always remember that moment at the end of The Hunter, as the thylacine bows down before the endless rapacity of mankind, and one human sadly plays his role as apex predator to another apex predator, now vanished from the Earth forever.That's what this film should really be called: The Predators.Or better yet, The Predators Who Won't Rest Until All Others Are Gone.One thing for sure: this movie made me think of what life would be like if dogs were extinct. If you love dogs, think of that for a bit. I sure did, and as soon as the credits rolled I laid down on the floor with our shepherd and nuzzled face to face with her for a long long time.Why can't the Golden Rule apply to all species?Even though this is not a great film per se, its basic intent is so rare and so moving that I'll never forget it. Or the look on that poor sad animal's face."
B007G5GMMC Great character. Interesting plot. I liked this movie. I would have liked it better if the other characters int he movie had been developed more fully."
B007G5GMMC Watching this on my Amazon Prime movies was really quite a treat. Much better than a lot of mainstream movies. Actor Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding performance here in this much different type of movie."
B007G5GMMC *Warning: Not A Film For Animal Lovers*In this atmospheric film, the always enjoyable Willem Dafoe plays Martin David - the current pseudonym for a private contractor who accepts any work as long as the job pays well. An acutely fussy person, his choice of employment is a odd contradiction given his desire for neat precision and harmonious balance. And his next job entails entering into a very imprecise and messy world.Assignment: Locate and harvest the Tasmanian Tiger, a dog-like creature that was hunted into extinction by ignorant immigrants early in the twentieth-century. Secret reports have reached a global biotech firm that it still exists; a confirmed sighting, likely the very last of its kind, somewhere in the cold mountains of the island nation. He's been ordered to hunt the animal down and kill it, taking samples of its blood, flesh and organs for purposes unknown.The difficulty of the mission is made clear from his arrival, under his cover as a university researcher, he is persona non grata. The local populace needs employment and that means strip logging the rainforest - so \"greenies\" like him aren't welcome. In fact, the locals are openly hostile to any perceived neo-hippie because they see them as job killers. Conversely, the huddled eco-warriors also don't trust newcomers - they've been battling to save the pristine woods and hunters have slipped past their ranks before.He has to secretly complete his contract while shunted in between these two actively opposing forces.Complicating matters - the broken family that houses his base of operations. Broken because the family's father and husband is missing, the near-catatonic wife obviously under the improper influence of a local guide, and their children left to fend for themselves. Questions surrounding the father's disappearance somehow being connected to his assignment only adds to the difficulty of accomplishing his job.And as he shuttles in between hunting excursions, he discovers something strange - an echo to his mission. A personal extinction and rebirth of his own, as he finds himself connecting with the family. Despite the clear danger to his mission, it's becoming more than just a distraction; Martin begins to rediscover his own humanity. But it's a discovery that may compromise more than just his payday.Again, a caution for animal lovers: The act of killing and butchering a small kangaroo-like animal - the wallaby - is accurately depicted in the film. Additionally, the hunter utilizes classic means of animal capture using various traps, including steel springs, the type with sharpened blades which clamp onto an animal's leg."
B007G5GMMC What a slow moving movie, very boring until the very end.SPOILER:  I have a BIG problem with how this ended, being that he kills the endangered animal in the end, only to THEN decide to not give in to Red-Leaf and burn the remains instead of turning them into that company.  Why not have just left it alone, he definitely wasn't helping the animal by offing it.  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid hunter.  Movie would have at least made MORE sense if after killing the animal he turned the specimens over after all that happened.  But then again, I hate hunting and people that kill animals as sport or leisure."
B007G5GMMC While this movie kept my attention it was a bit short on action and long on the morality of hunting an endangered species to extinction.  Secondly, it was difficult to find a real plot beyond the tired \"tormented\" man finds life alone satisfying.  I won't offer a spoiler here but I suspect the viewer will find the last 20 minutes or so rather disturbing if not disappointing.  This could have been much better."
B007G5GMMC Willem Dafoe is perfect as a loner who has been hired to track down a Tasmanian Tiger, thought to be extinct.  The company who hired him believes that the tiger has the ability to poison its prey when it bites.  It wants the animal to extract DNA for the potential development.  But there are competitors who may have similar objectives.Upon arrival in Australia, Martin (Dafoe) sets up a base of sorts through a pre-arranged room with a local family near the wilderness of Tasmania.  The husband/father has been missing for months.  The wife has taken numerous prescription drugs and remains incoherent most of the time and stays in bed.  A young girl about 7 and her brother, maybe 5 are pretty much left to fend for themselves.  Martin has used a guise of scientific study of Tasmanian Devils to gain acceptance from the local community.  Meanwhile, Martin finds himself in the middle of a conflict between commercial loggers and environmentalists.  The missing father was one of the environmentalists.The film is a bit slow at times but this is the story of multiple twists and turns.  Martin, not used to being around other people especially children, begins to find some comfort with the new family.  This is clearly new for him.  At the same time, the man vs. the wilderness angle, while sometimes tedious, more often results in high tension as Martin stalks the tiger.  Director Daniel Nettheim adds the additional character of the Tasmanian wilderness which is beautifully portrayed in the film.  Be prepared for an unpredictable conclusion to this excellent film."
B007G5GMMC William Dafoe is a great actor and is the only reason why this movie got 2 stars and not 1 star.  The plot was flawed, unrealistic and t
B007G5GMMC Another Hollywood movie that features a big name actor that turned out to be total crap! I can't imagine why such a notable actor would accept a role in this movie. Is he that hard up for money??? Movie is slow and boring and has very little to do with hunting a rare tiger. Are there no good writers left in Hollywood??? Boring and a total waste of time. Don't spend a penny on this film. Shame on you Hollywood!!!"
B007G5GMMC This kind of movie the tv channel use to complete your schedule, boring,no action like in the trailer.Not interesting, need more action and less talk, 40 min is good, 1h is bad, 1:40h i can't saw this, sorry."
B007G5GMMC Enjoyed! It's not hard to appreciate a movie like this due to its impressive cinematography and direction as well as a great performance by Willem Dafoe and cast."
B007G5GMMC After reading some of the reviews here, I put off watching the film for a week or so. I tend to ignore most critiques if there's general waffling and I'm pleased I did in this case, as well.I won't do a synopsis of the plot since there's plenty of that already but will say the film is based on the novel of the same name written by Julia Leigh.The film makers did an incredible job capturing the look and feel of a fairly hardcore trek through Tasmanian jungle and scrubland.Deft acting by all players keeps the film moving well as Defoes character goes through a quiet rebirth as his humanity and choices are challenged by happenstance when he's reluctantly pulled into the position of fourth tier in an \"instant family\".This is not 'The Expendables\", it's not 'Rambo' and it's not \"Jaws in the Woods'. It's a well crafted film with a tempo for those who can go for 120 minutes without the planet getting shredded by robots.It's quiet for long moments and dialogue is often absent as it should be when you're tracking anything elusive.The wrap up is like reading a Gerald Seymour novel - rarely a happy ending. This one, while down beat, does leave a glimmer of hope.Somebody send ScientistinDC some cartoons and a grammar book."
B007G5GMMC This is from the novel by Julia Leigh and tells the story of Martin Davis played by the brilliantly talented Willem `I use Just for Men' Dafoe who has been in more great films than you can shake two sticks at. Martin is an assassin who sort of always gets his man, like The Mounties but on the wrong side of the law. He is hired by an unscrupulous bio tech firm called Red leaf. They have bought into sightings of the assumed extinct Tasmanian Tiger and want samples of its DNA to synthesise for their own money grubbing ends.Martin arrives in the remote area of Tasmania posing as a researcher from a University, where he is supposed to lodge with Lucy (Francis O'Connor - `Bedazzled' and `A-I'). She is high on medication and her two young children, Sass and Bike are almost fending for themselves, with the ambiguous `help' of local ranger, Jack played by the always brilliant Sam Neill. Martin soon realises that Lucy's husband has been missing on the mountain for some time yet they are still holding out a forlorn hope that he will return, and little Bike seems to have lost the will to speak, and expresses himself through drawings.  Pretty soon Martin realises that he may not have been told the whole picture and the locals are positively hostile to all `foreigners' causing inevitable ructions.The closer Martin gets to his elusive quarry the closer he gets to nature and to the family he is increasingly caring for. The problem is Red Leaf want delivery at any price and so things are going to come to a head.This is an excellent film, both moving and gritty where it needs to be, there are scenes of animal butchery which I know can be upsetting for some. The country side is remarkably beautiful and the issues around conservation are left low key enough to be part of the fabric of the tale rather than the raison d'tre. All of the actors are superb and there is a poetry to the development of the story which unfolds at just the right pace to keep you hooked whilst allowing time for reflection too.The whole Tasmanian Tiger thing I have always found interesting, some American put up a huge reward for a live one, but stopped offering it a while back, the few who were placed in zoos never produced offspring and so they are believed to be extinct, but the coelacanth was believed to be extinct too but rare specimens have turned up, so there is always hope. This is a film for those that like movies to make them think and get a bit dewy eyed at the same time, I absolutely loved it and can only recommend."
B007G5GMMC \"This is important, there is no room for mistakes.\" When A bio-tech company is looking for someone to get a test animal for them they turn to Martin (Dafoe). After traveling to Tasmania for his job he meets a young girl named Sass and her family. The family begins to change the way he feels about the job, but the company sends constant reminders. This is another very surprising movie. When it boils down to it the movie is pretty much about poaching...but it is so much more. The movie is very heartfelt and surprisingly emotional. While also being a little depressing the movie is very much worth watching. Dafoe is great in this movie and I have to say that even though the movie doesn't sound interesting this is a very good movie and will not disappoint. There really isn't that much I can say about this. Between his hunt for the tiger and his helping the family this is a movie that really shows Martin's struggle with his job and his conscience. I recommend this. Overall, a emotional and depressing hunting movie that is worth a watch. I give it an A-."
B007G5GMMC Can't give a good review. Couldn't get into movie. I know it has a good lineup of stars, but interrupted and could not get back into movie. Slow start."
B007G5GMMC W. Dafoe is surrounded by a bunch of no good antisocial idiots up in the mountains. Not sure why everybody hates him. He is coming to hunt something. Not sure what and why.He arrives in a house with kids where the mom is depressed because her husband has disappeared. He quickly connects with the kids. Not sure what is he doing there and what is the point. Sam Neil's role is still not clear to me. Towards the middle of the movie we know what is he doing up there. Doesn't make any sense scientifically. Not sure how the genetic material will help and for what disease. The whole thing is weird and disconnected.The ending is surprising, not predictable but totally stupid. I still didn't get the message...if there is any!Very poorly done. Expected better from the cast. Two stars just for the acting."
B007G5H2X0 Just finished watching ATM and thought it was well acted ,well thought out and somewhat clever but there were also some pretty big plot holes,I won't go into them because I don't want to venture into spoiler territory.The camera work and film quality were excellent and lent to the rich feel of the production.If your expecting a blood bath or a gore fest this isn't the film for you, there are some violent scenes but nothing really graphic.So gore hounds skip it.It is instead a taunt thriller with some very tense moments with a claustrophobic feel .Think Frozen meets P2 but in a confined area.The only problem I had with this film was that there was no back story or explanation given about the menacing figure outside the ATM.I wanted to know what his motive was because in the film it clearly seems personal.Bottom line,I recommend it if your looking for a good executed thriller,taking in consideration the con that I mentioned."
B007G5H2X0 one of the worst movies of all the time...terrible movie..who wrote this movie??? the director must be shooooot himself...this is a low cheap budget movie terrible...stay away..."
B007G5H2X0 I watched this film despite the small rating because the idea interested me. I found several plot holes yes, the acting was good and true which helped \"maintain\" an atmosphere of tension and suspense. I also kept wondering what it could be. If you are going to watch this film just to bash it up if you find flaws, don't watch it. If you're watching and going to keep your brain aside and just be prepared for the ride, you will enjoy it like I did. ATM will make for a good \"watch at home\" film for many years to come. Funnily in the first fifteen minutes I thought it was going to be one heck of a great film. Do watch if you're curious."
B007G5H2X0 I enjoyed ATM a lot.  I was originally going to avoid renting it because it had some bad reviews on here but I wanted to because I love Josh Peck and Alice Eve.  Two of my favorite actors ever!  Plus somebody had compared it to Frozen . Frozen is one of my all time favorite movies.I don't like this nearly as much as Frozen but that's a movie I'd have to give at least twenty stars to.ATM still deserves five stars.  It's suspenseful as hell, the killer is really creepy and the general atmosphere is just creepy and scary.  The midwest setting in the dead of winter is great.The ATM premise is obviously a bit absurd but no more than the ski lift premise of Frozen.  What matters is the execution.  This movie is just flawless.  The acting is great all around and it was nice to see Alice Eve in a role that had nothing to do with her looks, she was almost playing a nerdy plain girl and she did a great job.I haven't checked the director's name but I will definitely do that and be looking out for any other movies they have made.I would even see a sequel to this.  It was a fun movie!"
B007G5H2X0 The movie is short, thank goodness for that. The plot was too silly (over an hour stuck in a ATM). The acting was stiff at times, if I was a killer I'd just stand outside the whole damn time????The movie obviously has many flaws and if it was released at a Box Office it would have bombed. I expected something better but just like P2 and other junk films called \"Thrillers\" this movie was not that."
B007G5H2X0 ATM follows three co-workers as they make a late-night stop at an isolated ATM; as they are leaving, they notice a strange person watching and stalking them. The concept is great, and could've kept people from using ATMs at night, but fails to effectively use it.The bulk of the film takes place in a walk-in-ATM (think: a very large phone booth) in a parking lot. A chain of unfortunate and illogical events take place that leads them there; for example, they need cash because Corey (Josh Peck) must eat at night and the place he must eat at only accepts cash. That's slightly understandable, right? Oh, but David (Brian Geraghty) has to park as far away as possible, then everyone has to get out of the car because Corey's debit card is not working and Emily (Alice Eve) doesn't want to wait in the car. Then, all of the phones are dead or misplaced. Unfortunate for this group, but very fortunate for the psycho outside. Other events like these are scattered across the movie, like a security guard with very bad hearing. Honestly, they could've rushed the man that was clearly unarmed at the beginning or split up when he disappeared for several minutes at a time. As you can see, the movie is poorly and lazily written. I did like the concept a lot, and the feeling of helplessness was evident. The acting was decent, and the music was great. It also has a very fast pace, and has a runtime of 1hr and 20min without the credits, so it's a perfect time-killer if you can get past the illogical events. The ending was also decent.Overall, ATM has an amazing and chilling concept, but it's ultimately poorly executed. It has many flaws, but can kill time if you're bored and want a couple of thrills. As of 10/13/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and you should stream or rent before purchasing.ATM has strong blood and violence, no sex or nudity."
B007G5H2X0 After a company christmas party on a cold winter night (guess a Christmas party in summer would be kinda tacky wouldn't it) we have three friends who decide to stop at an ATM. The simpliest of things often turn into a nightmare (or at least they do in this film) and as all of them go to leave some guy in a big winter coat with a massive hood is standing outside looking at them. Unable to figure out what he wants initially it becomes obvious this guy wants something from them and that seems to be to watch them suffer as he does things to get inside and kill them.Its a simple premise and a bit like Colin Farrell's \"Phone Booth\" in that for most of the film its centralized to just the ATM location with the three panicking friends and the killer on the outside. The cast is also pretty typical as the three friends are played by (Alice Eve \"She's Out of My League\", Brian Geragthy \"Jarhead\" and Josh Peck TV's \"Drake & Josh\") as is the killer who really does nothing more than stand outside looking menacing and well of course kills.There are plenty of problems with this movie, namely one being the viewer constantly thinking \"Just run to the car, you can take him\" especially in the early going when the guy goes around the back of the building. It becomes clear what the motives are behind this game the guy is playing with the three people none of which is terribly shocking I guess. Its hard to do a movie from one location and while I give director David Brooks (in his feature debut) props for trying something different there really isn't enough tension to keep the movie going for a full length running time. *1/2 out of 4 stars."
B007G5H2X0 Although I am certain that some people will not like \"ATM,\" I actually found it to be a relatively enjoyable little thriller.  As a B-movie guilty pleasure, this slight film benefits from having modest ambitions.  Thus, with its limited scope, I think it works satisfactorily as a pleasing and entertaining diversion.  You want a big complicated plot?  You need interesting back story?  You want character motivation?  Don't bother with any of that!  \"ATM\" plays out as a simple, but extravagant, nightmare.  Three young professionals visit an ATM booth in the middle of the night only to have that seemingly mundane decision irrevocably change their lives.  A menacing figure watches them from afar.  And as they contemplate what to do, his murderous intentions become quite clear.  Who is he?  Why has he targeted this trio?  Again, the plot that holds \"ATM\" together is sketchy at best.  You'll get the most enjoyment by not thinking about it, not analyzing the logic, just experiencing it.  Normally, I might not have thrown aside intellectual reservations but I found the cast appealing and reasonably resourceful so, in this instance, I was willing to go along for the ride.It helps immeasurably that the movie casts Brian Geraghty, Josh Peck, and Alice Eve in the principle roles.  All are exceedingly likable, their chemistry is palpable, and their discourse is amusing.  We meet the trio at an office Christmas party.  Geraghty is secretly crushing on Eve and his chance to score some alone time with her is compromised when he has to give his intrusive friend (Peck) a ride home as well.  They are soon on the road, bantering playfully.  A last minute decision to score some cash (who doesn't love late night eats?) begins a hellish descent into surviving at all costs.  To make the situation particularly delightful, they park (for the sake of plot convenience) a spectacular distance from the booth.  It's so silly, you have to laugh along!  Later on a security guard will do the same thing!  But once confined in the booth, the film generates a fair amount of suspense as they try to figure out what to do.  And the performances are committed and believable.As I said, \"ATM\" doesn't attempt anything too complex and that's why it works as well as it does.  I'd have preferred that the danger be a random madman, but as in movies of this type--he seems to be a skillful genius.  But I did think the movie was fun and I really think that is all it was aspiring to be.  About 3 1/2 stars.  This gritty little picture won't win any awards, but it passes a tense 90 minutes.  KGHarris, 7/12."
B007G5H2X0 this movie was so bad....dont want to waste time explaining it...good concept?!?! but ultimately really really awful.thank god it was free."
B007G5H2X0 a tense but also repetitive thriller that is worth watching. Ending is great & disturbing. I give it a B. worth a watch"
B007G5H2X0 I watched two movies last night (The other one was THE FIELDS) and both movies showed promise but both ended without satisfying resolutions.ATM sets up a simple but intriguing premise:  three young business people stop at an ATM, only to be terrorized by a psychotic killer.  Suspense ensues with some incredibly stupid plot devices.  First and foremost, why does David park so far away from the ATM kiosk?  As does the security guard.  Why does Corey lie about having a lighter?  Other questions would serve as spoilers so I won't go there.Brian Geragthy, Josh Peck and Alice Eve are fine in their roles and director Chris Fisher uses the claustrophobic setting effectively.  Too bad his script didn't measure up.ATM could've been a tidy little thriller but ultimately is a misfire."
B007G5H2X0 After watching this film, I'm really scared to go to the ATM whether its alone or with friends. This movie is a good thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. My roommates and I really enjoyed it. Josh Peck was a good actor. It was good to see him on screen after such a long time from Drake & Josh."
B007G5H2X0 I would give it three and a half if I could. There were so many things that you don't do if using a ATM, now to be fair where I live there are no inclosed ATMs but if there were I would not park two hundred feet away in a snow storm, in a vacant parking lot for a friend to walk to it. With my friend taking a long time I don't think I would have a young lady I just met at the office party to walk over with me to see why. Its like don't open that door in every movie or don't hit the guy again he is dead the movie is over or is it. But all in all if you can get by the why don'ts, and just think of it as very dumb people you will enjoy."
B007G5H2X0 Great thriller with decent acting and a unique concept, but has a terrible ending!  I will not get into it, to not give it away, but the ending could have been much better!"
B007G5H2X0 The set up of a horror or thriller, such as ATM, is probably one of the most important parts of the film. You can expect a chase, gore scenes, some monstrosity's, and if time permits, character development. So here we have two seemingly successful people working in finance who leave a party to bring home a good looking woman, who also works with them. One of the guys needs to stop at an ATM to get money for his late night munchies.The film seems to be set in the city. New York City (or at least something like to NYC). But apparently the only ATM is on this remote street with no one around. Pulling up to the ATM, he parks, what seems like a half a block away. Why not just pull right up to it?? I don't know anyone that does this, especially at 1 in the morning. And so, between the car and the ATM hut stands the killer. And yes, they all forgot their cell phones in the car.I just get infuriated how people find themselves in situations like this. It could be argued on the other side that what are the chances of some crazy guy looking to kill some people locked in an ATM hut. But err on the safe side when the chances are higher that strange people creep around at night in big cities. Ultimately, however, it just seems too convenient for the killer to get into place.The film does not offer much other than high tension. As the other reviewers mentioned, the question of \"why\" is never answered. Clearly it is not supposed to. I am not sure if thats the question the film is offering either. I think its more stating that \"it can be done\". If we recall the opening credit sequence, we see maps and diagrams and coordinates. All of this for the killer as a challenge for technology.I am probably being more poetic than the film deserves, but its a measure of avoidance as the film has little substance to work with. Anything revealed gives away almost too much. I can only assume that the film was green lit based on a pitch and wasn't developed further.Now that I have my gripes out of the way, I will say that the film is well done and the drama is exciting and intense. The acting is credible and well executed, so that's a bonus. It is worth a rental, but not at the current price. I would wait for the actual DVD release. It was exciting and entertaining, but the lack of the depth the film has, I cannot merit it more than 2 stars."
B007G5H2X0 ATM (David Brooks, 2012)ATM, the first feature from director David Brooks, is a run-of-the-mill thriller. Really, that's it's major problem, and the reason it seems to have attracted so much vitriol. Sure, people are complaining about the script's plot holes, but come on, The Island made, what, eight hundred billion dollars or something? And it had plot holes large enough to swallow this entire script. And, yeah, the characters make some stupid moves, but again, this is a horror film. Horror films without characters who make stupid moves? They're not horror films, they're something else. (I'm not sure what, because in forty years of watching them, I can't recall ever seeing one.) All the other complaints I've seen about the film are strengths, not weaknesses. But I'm getting ahead of myself (and would have to dive deep into spoiler territory anyway, so I'll probably conveniently ignore them).Plot: three co-workers, David (The Hurt Locker's Brian Geraghty), his best friend Corey (Josh Peck, the longtime voice of Eddie from the Ice Age animated franchise), and possible future love interest Emily (The Raven's Alice Eve), are headed home late from their company Christmas party. (Goof note: early in the film, Corey refers to the fact that it's three days before Christmas. Every time you see the security camera footage from the ATM, the footage is dated December 17th. Is Christmas on a different day in Manitoba?) Corey is both hungry and broke, so he asks David, who's driving, to stop at an ATM. Through a series of misadventures like those you're used to seeing in both horror movies and stupid teen sex comedies, all three of them end up in the ATM vestibule. (Unfortunately, this is where the teen sex comedy similarity ends.) When they go to leave the vestibule, standing between them and their car is a masked man wearing an anorak (the anorak becomes important). They figure he's just waiting in line to use the machine until a random guy walking his dog wanders into the parking lot, and is quickly, and brutally, dispatched. The movie then becomes a waiting game, with the three players inside trapped and trading recriminations, while the anonymous killer just stands there, watching, and occasionally disappears in order to make amusing thumping noises to scare the victims.I'm willing to write off a lot in horror movies (for example, what most people are thinking is the Big Twist part of the Big Twist Ending is a simple misunderstanding that will be cleared up by all the principal parties five minutes after the camera stops rolling) without taking points off; that's just part of being a fan of the genre. And like I said before, it comes with the territory that you're dealing with stupid people making stupid decisions. The problems arise when the script fails in its continuity--for example, have one character being so close to cold-related death as to be delirious halfway through the film, and then, five minutes later and with no added heat source, having that character be the most lucid in the vestibule (for the rest of the film). Annoyances like this, when it comes to movies like this, are absolutely legitimate, and should be criticized. But it's not an awful movie, even if it is yet another entry in an oversaturated genre. If you can dismiss the silly continuity errors (and get past the fact that while Brian Geraghty is a solid character actor, he may not be quite ready for leads yet), it's good enough late-night Netflix viewing if nothing else looks appealing. **"
B007G5H2X0 David (Brian Geraghty) is a shy stock investor. Co-worker Emily (Alice Eve) is perhaps equally shy. On her last day of work, David works up the courage to ask her out. She agrees and also agrees to let David drive her home. The problem is there is a third wheel, mutual co-worker Corey (Josh Peck) who needs a ride and is hungry. They agree to grab a bite at a unique all night place that only accepts cash. They must first visit a remote ATM. Time and temperature are flashed for us to set the tone: 1:18 AM, -3F. The three are in the ATM.Outside the ATM, is a man assuming the \"Jason pose.\" He brutally murders another man in the parking lot. The trio is afraid to venture out and I am thinking...did they just remake an ATM version of \"Frozen\"?For some undisclosed reason the killer doesn't try to enter the ATM. You will find out more, or less at the ending.If you liked \"Frozen\" or \"Altitude\" (and I didn't) you might try ATM.1 f-bomb, no sex or nudity."
B007G5H2X0 \"ATM\" is a thriller that begins at a company Christmas party.  Insecure investment banker David (Brian Geraghty) asks co-worker Emily (Alice Eve) if she'd like a ride home.  Emily, who's been David's secret crush, agrees, but David's pushy, wisecracking friend Corey (Josh Peck) winds up joining them as they leave.  When Corey asks them to make a late-night stop at a free-standing, glass-enclosed ATM in a dimly-lit parking lot, what had been a romantically promising night for David turns into a nightmare as a mysterious man in a hoodie and mask appears.  He might just be waiting to use the machine, but when he suddenly and brutally kills an innocent passerby, the three realize they are trapped.The mysterious stranger is in the mold of the nondescript Michael Meyers of \"Halloween,\" but rather than merely stand in doorways or commit gruesome murders off-screen, the villain here is more graphic in his dastardly deeds.  Director David Brooks creates a chilling atmosphere -- figuratively and literally -- as temperature plays a significant role in the hapless trio's attempt to make it through a grueling night in freezing weather.  There's an effective score to heighten suspense, but the film runs out of steam long before the final credits roll. The Blu-ray contains both the R-rated theatrical and unrated director's cut versions."
B007G5H2X0 I'm torn on ATM.  On one hand it's overwhelmingly dumb and filled with plot holes and yet, somehow, I still liked the damn thing.  At an office Christmas party, David has just gotten up the nerve to talk to co-worker Emily (Alice Eve) and offers to give her a ride home.  However his friend Corey (Josh peck from Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh) decides to be a third wheel and tags along for a ride home as well.  Corey asks to stop at an ATM on the way home and that is where the trio's night of terror begins.They stop at one of those enclosed, cabin-type of ATMs that requires your debit card to get into.  As they turn to leave the ATM they see a man standing outside staring at them.  He's dressed in a hooded parka, hiding his face.  Thinking he might want to rob them the three remain inside the safety of the ATM.  But when their tormentor kills a man walking his dog, they realize their situation is much more grave than they thought.  Soon the trio turns on each other as paranoia begins to grip them as the mysterious man just stands outside the ATM, daring them to try and escape.ATM is certainly an interesting concept.  Most of us probably utilize an ATM at least once a week and while I've never used one of these enclosed types of ATMs, I know I certainly always am aware of my surroundings when I use one.  Director David Brooks builds suspense nicely as well as the mystery of their assailant.  I quite enjoyed Josh Peck, having a son who loved Josh and Drake I was very familiar with him and he makes a strong transition to a more adult role.But as mentioned, ATM is quite dumb and if you can't suspend disbelief you're likely not going to enjoy the film much.  There are holes aplenty in the plot.  Why does David park some 60 - 70 feet from the ATM when the parking lot is completely empty, especially when it is below freezing outside?  And the precept that got all three inside the booth was downright silly.  It makes no sense in reality but made no sense in the film either as it wasn't necessary.  With two relatively in shape males and one female all in their 20's, why not rush the man, especially after it was made clear he had no gun or other dangerous weapon?  Why not run in three different directions?  At least two would have escaped and been able to get help.If you can look beyond the many plot holes, ATM is a flawed, but fun film."
B007G5H2X0 \"Why is he doing this?!!\" After finally getting up the nerve to talk to the girl he likes David (Geraghty) is excited to be driving Emily (Eve) home. When his friend Corey (Peck) crashes his date and asks to stop at the ATM machine he is counting down the minutes till he can get Emily alone. After getting out the cash they turn around and notice a stranger starting at them. Their night takes a deadly turn. To start with this is not a bad movie at all. I like the movies like this where it takes an everyday activity and introduces terror into it. The big problem with this is that after a half hour it seemed to run out of ideas and kept repeating itself over and over. The one thing that really saved this and made it enjoyable was the end. This is not a typical \"Hollywood\" ending and that helped the movie a lot. If you liked \"Devil\" or \"Phonebooth\" then you will also like this one. This is worth a watch. Overall, a tense but also repetitive thriller that is worth watching. Ending is great & disturbing. I give it a B."
B007G5H2X0 The premise of \"ATM\" - three people trapped in an ATM vestibule - is created by Chris Sparling, writer of another confined-space thriller \"Buried\" starring Ryan Reynolds. In \"ATM,\" while withdrawing money from an ATM on the way home from a Christmas party, two young men and woman David (Brian Geraghty), Corey (Josh Peck) and Emily (Alice Eve) are trapped in an ATM booth by a hooded stranger, whose intent is not friendly.Though the story itself is not implausible, the way it unfolds feels so contrived and unrealistic that most viewers would stop caring what is going on. Without revealing too much of the film, I can say that 30 minutes into the film things start getting silly. The more elaborate the story gets, the less thrilling the film becomes, making us think about simpler solutions for the three characters.With convincing psychological interactions between the characters (including the stranger standing outside), \"ATM\" would have been much more entertaining. As it is, \"ATM\" is a typical case of a nice concept ruined by poor execution."
B007G5H2X0 great horror movie.....it was worth the 9.99 i spent on it when it came out........very entertaining.....good amount of blood scenes.........kind of a twisty ending....i liked it !!!"
B007G5H2X0 Okay, these 3 folks should not have left the phones in the car and never should have parked so far away or gone into such a remote ATM.  Otherwise, though, this is a very scary situation that will give you pause and make you wonder why the killer wants to target people this way."
B007H63DRW After her husband's death, Amanda Vaughn is emotionally and financially drained because of her husband's actions, therefore she packs her bags, what the IRS didn't claim, and along with her two teenage kids, heads back home to Highland Park, Texas to live with her mother, Elizabeth \"Gigi\" Stopper.During high school Amanda wasn't exactly the nicest person as she made her peers' lives a living hell. Now that Amanda is back in her home town, she is looking for a new start, but four of her ex-high school (Carlene Clockburn, Sharon Peacham, and Cricket Caruth-Reilly, and Heather Cruz) peers have a grudge to settle with her as they plan on making her life miserable.I was little skeptical of GCB, but I was a fan of Kristin Chenoweth and there was nothing else to watch after Desperate Housewives. The first episode was a little rocky, but after viewing a couple more episodes, I started to enjoy the quirkiness of all the characters. I especially liked Gigi, played by Annie Potts, as she pursued Carlen's uncle, Burl, played by Bruce Boxleitner. I rolled my eyes over the backlash of the title as people were judging before they actually watched an episode. I am Christian and I never once was offended. Thanks to a lousy 9:00 PM Central timeslot, GCB didn't get a chance to expose itself to more viewers. Despite its cleverly written scripts and great acting, ABC wrongly cancelled GCB where it could have done great in the fall taking over Housewives' old timeslot."
B007H63DRW Last year we sadly lost our beloved Desperate Housewives. In a gloom of that sadness, ABC brought us GCB, the cleverly funny satire on Christian women in Texas, that has/had the potential to take the spot of Desperate Housewives. The good Christian bitches were headed up by the incomparable and amazing Kristin Chenoweth as Carlene Cockburn. Carlene is the perfect Christian wife and mother, but she has her short comings, such as gossiping and backstabbing. The other GCBs (Sharon Peacham, Heather Cruz, Cricket Caruth-Reilly played by Jennifer Aspen, Marisol Nichols, & Miriam Shor) also had their own shortcomings and secrets. Sharon had gained a few pounds since high school, Heather couldn't keep a man to save her life, and Cricket was keeping the secret of her closeted gay husband. Their lives were as perfect as perfect can get (from looking in) until the day that their high school tormentor, Amanda Vaughn, comes back to Dallas to stay. The GCB's don't like that whatsoever and are determined to take Amanda down at any costs as payback for their high schools days.This show was filled with nothing but hilarity and great one liners, like the always funny Carlene always saying to Amanda, \"Amanda, Amanda, Sweet (insert diss) Amanda.\" It's such a shame that ABC doesn't care about their fans and that they just cancelled GCB without even considering that it became a hit. I hope one day ABC or even another network will pick GCB back up one day. I would love to see another few seasons from these good Christian bitches."
B007H63DRW kristin chenoweth does not look to be the same age as the star that she was supposed to go to highschool with. i got as far as the star getting a job at the restaurant called Boobies. I am not making up the name! this show was stupid and did not make me laugh. I got it because i saw Kristin Chenoweth in some movie and she was really funny.  not this tv show,that's for sure! 2 thumbs the eff down!"
B007H63DRW Note: I saw this online with XFinity On Demand.This show attracted my attention, despite my having read about the name change the show went through from its disturbing original title, which is extremely disrespectful and irreverent. Based on ABC's excellent track record this year (though they were stupid enough to cancel the reboot of Charlie's Angels, Once Upon A Time and Revenge have been major successes for the network; they should have given Charlie's Angels a shot at sticking it out), I decided to give this series a shot, but just for the pilot, as I also found out that there's a gay character on the show. Why does almost every television series have a gay character on TV these days? It's nauseating. But I digress.Watching the pilot episode of this show was like seeing my cousin on drugs. Primarily, this series makes Christians look hypocritical and superficial. Granted, there ARE some Christians like that, but not all Christians are hypocritical, superficial, judgmental, and promiscuous, as this show strongly implies they are. Jesus saith unto His disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.\" This series is doing exactly the opposite; it's spreading a bad reputation of Christians and ultimately blasphemes the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. And scenes in a bar with an extremely suggestive name? Come on, Disney! Why are you doing this? You're a FAMILY-FRIENDLY company. (Thank God, the gay thing was only IMPLIED, but I do not want to know how far ABC will go).This series is another one I will definitely NOT be watching."
B007H63DRW I am so sorry this has ended.  It was wonderfully entertaining.  I am going to watch it again very soon because it made me laugh so hard.  That last episode in the desert was a scream.  The writers of this show are very creative with the most bizarre and interesting plots.  I am puzzled as to why it was cancelled after only one season.  The whacky characters and episodes grew more endearing to me with each disc.  Thanks for all the zany fun.  Come back!  Come back!"
B007H63DRW Everything is bigger in Texas and ABC's comic soap opera \"GCB\" is out to prove it!  Completely over-the-top (and I mean that as a compliment), this show plays to and skewers every Southern cliche imaginable.  From Dallas society to religious propriety, the sharp screenplays always have their tongues planted firmly in cheek and the ten episodes of Season One are filled with scandal, infidelities, old rivalries, and even a song or two.  Creator Robert Harling adapted the colorfully titled Kim Gatlin novel which doesn't abbreviate just what GCB stands for.  ABC, apparently a bit shy about employing the B-word in the show's title, briefly flirted with the notion of Good Christian Belles (which sells out Gatlin's entire premise) but then settled on GCB as an appropriate compromise (and then promptly and ironically rolled out another mid-season replacement sitcom in which the B-word figured prominently in the title).  Meant to recapture some of the luster of the aging and wildly uneven \"Desperate Housewives,\" the show failed to build on that ratings lead-in and it's a shame.  If more people had sampled \"GCB,\" they might have been caught up in its madcap antics!\"GCB\" addresses what happens when a former mean girl returns to her hometown roots to reunite with old high school friends and rivals.  Leslie Bibb is this reformed baddie who arrives in Dallas in shame after her criminal husband has died under scandalous circumstances.  Her controlling mother (Annie Potts) welcomes her and her two kids with open arms, but a quartet of former acquaintances aren't quite so accepting.  Bibb, though, is truly trying to be a better person.  Her friends, meanwhile, who have all achieved success start to feel old insecurities creep back.  The show is crisp and sassy and quite a bit of fun.  The plots, however, play second fiddle to one of the more spry and hysterical comic ensembles on TV.  The cast is really the star of this show!Bibb is wildly appealing and I'm not sure why she isn't a bigger star.  Potts has her best role in years and chews up every scene she's in as the Republican gun-toting matriarch figure.  Kristin Chenoweth is delightful as the primary foil and serves up diva deliciousness (I couldn't resist upping the cheese factor) with unapologetic abandon.  She is the piece's largest villain, but you've got to love her just the same and her faithful husband (David James Elliott) balances her perfectly.  And she gets to sing--always a welcome diversion.  Miriam Shor is a revelation as she battles Chenoweth for dominance of their little group and her marriage of convenience to her best friend (a great Mark Deklin) provides one of the most interesting relationships on the show.  Jennifer Aspen plays the group's more trusting and easily influenced member, and her attraction to the local pastor is quite funny.  The last lady is played by Marisol Nichols (who is lovely), but in a cast with such big personalities--she can often be overshadowed.Episodes are presented in anamorphic widescreen video, with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, and subtitles in Spanish and French.  This 3-disc set includes all ten episodes (approx 430 minutes) with Bonus Material including:Episode CommentariesDeleted and Extended ScenesBloopersBigger in TexasLiving LargePreaching to the ChoirHigh School LessonsSpicy Scripture - Relationship LessonsThe show doesn't do subtlety!  It's loud, fun and completely outrageous.  Maybe it wasn't the best show on network TV, but it was one of the more wildly entertaining ones.  And as not enough viewers have turned out, these ten episodes are probably the end.  I guess it's back to watching the endless procedural crime shows on TV.  Ughhh.  In that landscape, \"GCB\" felt like a breath of fresh air.  KGHarris, 5/12."
B007H63DRW Good Christian B****es indeed.  This is a good comedy drama with some good acting. They did a good job in exaggerating the Texan big hair and gun crazy attitude. But wait - maybe it's not much of an exaggeration. LOL.Canceled due to the group One Million Moms - FU group. No longer respect this group."
B007H63DRW I really didn't see it as attacking Christianity. It was supposed to be a commentary on how self-righteous the bible-belt frequently tends to get. And I think this is what had viewers (particularly in the region) up in arms. Hell hath no fury like somebody whose flaws are uncovered for all the world to see and critique.All of this said, I myself personally did not find the show appealing.First, it replaced my favorite series Pan Am. Strike One. So I was already naturally bound to come in with a bit of skepticism--even when it says there is satire of my 'home region'.  They should have moved the series for a different night and/or time. And just kept the good show on.Go with what already works. Give yourselves time to workout problems with the new show and build up a 'new' audience.Strike two. These women acted like my stepmother! The big hair, holier than thou blond-bimbo-bombshell diva routine, just was not personally funny in any television script. The series main character is starting over after herself having been a you-know-what. So there was potentially room here to successfully build in audience. Most people like to see underdogs succeed against tremendous odds.But she still contends with 'the attitude' from her peer group. I already get enough of this off camera. And television is supposed to be a relaxing escape from real life. It's not supposed to ailenate the viewing audience ourself from--yes, boredom. People aren't going to watch a 'sitcom' rehashing reality. The odds which she was supposed to come up against were the wrong ones to successfully hold audience interest for a weekly sitcom-drama.It just wasn't 'fun' viewing. Sorry ABC."
B007H63DRW A very cute show - love the cast!  I hope this show stays around!  The story line is funny - a little out there, but funny.  The cast members are stellar!  I hate it that this show was not renewed!"
B007H63DRW This show really surprised me and I like it!  I've never heard of any of the actors, but they did a great job.  I can identify with the holier than thou attitudes, the good and not so good memories of high school, and the drama that comes with reuniting with old friends and acquintances.  I recommend this series."
B007H63DRW This was a great show. The quality for the HD purchase is great. I am very disappointed in them having taken the show off the air. They never even gave it a chance (it was a mid-season replacement). This goes off the air, but CRAP stay on. I miss the days when television of a certain quality was the goal vs how many of this or that age group tuned it to the cheapest made programs."
B007H63DRW I am so tired of every show either having some sort of gay element or bashing on Christians. Are the writers just lazy or have they run out of ideas?I know that \"shallowood\" puts out a lot, and I mean a lot of trash, but this is really something.  Just in the title alone I do not know how women are not up in arms over it. Maybe it is a way to get people to watch the show. The free preview was enough to make me gag.I am up for giving a show a chance, but not this one.Update: Good for ABC. They canceled this garbage!!"
B007H63DRW Another show they took off much too soon my Mother loved this show and the networks canceled it after one season but at least she can watch them on dvd now."
B007HDPJSG It was an interesting video that gave a really interesting view about living in today's world. If you tend to have a closed mind, trust me this is not for you. You may go insane with laughter or overwhelming fear. But don't knock it until you really see it. You might have to watch it more than three times to get the message it is trying to give you. And you may not have the capacity to believe it ( I don't Yet, but it makes sense on a certain level). The video itself was okay, it's documentary approach was weird. It's Believe-ability is up to you."
B007HDPJSG The film lasts about 35 minutes and it had my undivided attention.  The background music was soothing and inviting - not demanding. The people who were interviewed and the moderator - portrayed a spiritual sense of needing to know more and we cannot know more until we share what we know. They shared quite a bit of information on matter, geometry, physics, astrology, and so forth.  It is very informing.I would definitely want to see more films made by Gundi G but this film, as much as they claim to encompass everything - fails to encompass or address the aspect of evil  - a significant reality, which brings me to the notion that I am NOT God. I seek power that gives me the strength to go on and most certainly I have experienced the feeling that I am being carried through difficult times and I am not alone. I believe prayer not only strengthens ourselves, yet when we pray for others, it strengthens them."
B007HDPJSG The theme was boring. The actors/experts were boring. There was no story line. I left the movie after 30 minutes."
B007HDPJSG My favorite part of this film was the final credits, when various mystics and spiritual experts appeared in little boxes and talked about personal incidents from their lives in a less formal, more off-the-cuff manner than during the previous part.  I've gotta say that the repetition of &#34;Who am I?&#34; and the answer (&#34;I am God&#34;) got a little old, but it's the kind of concept that those raised in a western religious tradition have a lot of trouble grasping because it sounds like the ultimate ego trip. So maybe it does bear repeating. Eastern philosophies are much more in sync with that concept.I agree with other reviewers that the beautiful young lady who was silently emoting throughout the film, and the New Agey music, were also a bit much, and there was a definite fragrance of infomercialism to it.  But the message is a good one.  If we each comport ourselves like we are all divine and respond to each other accordingly, the strife and misunderstanding in the world will inevitably disappear.  But that's a very tall order for most of us opinionated souls, and I don't see it happening any time soon.I assume that the book this film is based on has a lot more substance to it, but this is a good beginning."
B007HDPJSG .....Then you'll like this film.  Its almost like a sequel to The Secret, only its not selling you on how to get anything you want, but more of a insight to spiritual awareness.  Quite good."
B007HGY0S8 Army Wives never failed to grab my attention. I loved all the characters especially the dynamics between the different couples profiled in this drama. I asked a woman who had experience as a military wife and she confirmed that Army Wives is very true to the lives of the spouses left behind to bear the burden (and experiencing the joys) of raising children alone while their spouse was across the world serving our great country."
B007HGY0S8 I had to move to Germany when this season started & hated to miss it. I too am an Air Force Wife & can relate to 90% of these storylines. I love them & can't wait fir season 7 to start."
B007HGY0S8 watched first 3 episodes, the hurricane and its aftermath. my wife liked it. I was semi-bored. It's about the army but no shooting."
B007HGY0S8 Just because I love the story line, and the involvement with existing situations, I was a little disappointed to see my favorites leave but looks like there will be some promising characters built in the series as it goes forward. Looking forward to the start of the new season."
B007HGY0S8 This is the best show, and I had lost track of all the episodes, so I thought of Amazon. It was a great picture, and I got all caught up!"
B007HGY0S8 This show is superb and I hope it continues for many more seasons.  I was married to military, and I am military.  This show actually depicts a true life of military with very possible scenarios.  Although it is a drama, it is very realistic."
B007HGY0S8 It was already not the best show on TV, but at least with the original cast as the original characters the show could be good, clean fun.  After most of the cast left, and the producers tried in vain to replace them with equally compelling players, the show clearly went downhill."
B007HGY0S8 This on going story about Army life and family and friends is great. You feel part of the tribe.  love the story."
B007HGY0S8 The glimpse of Hollywoods idea of army wives lives when soldiers are deployed is entertaining but I don't think all army wives (or any military branch) are all so slim, pretty and poised. I think when real problems hit women are strong but not so glamorous in dealing with them.  Thank you."
B007HYMHEE These guys give a slightly new spin to the series of auctions. They are able to keep the subject enjoyable"
B007HYMHEE The show is too scripted. A reality show is SUPPOSED to be off the &#34;cuff&#34; and spontaneous. This show is too scripted. And why is Roy Williams (one of the dirtiest football players that ever played) on the show? He's an absolute idiot!Talk about scripted...when was the last time YOU were able to walk right up to a famous athletes house and ring his door bell?What a crock."
B007HYMHEE There seems to be a lot of conflict between the auctioneer and one buyer, favoritism. Interesting finding out what oddball stuff is and it's value."
B007HYMHEE This is one of the best storage bidding shows out there. I think much of the Items they find could indeed be found in a storage locker."
B007HYMHEE I'm reviewing the pilot of the 2nd season, not the show in general. First take is Moe is the new Barry, the outlandish outsider, '[Moe] looks like a gay pimp', doubtful he'll be nearly as fun as Barry was.  The impression I get is that they had a great formula with S1, and now it seems *formulaic*; combine a goofy rich guy just having fun, a cutthroat businessman, a quarreling 'couple', the covert 'yokel' maverick and you are winning.  They just changed the geography but they are trying to reboot the tropes with a different cast of characters.  Not that this is a bad thing, it's just what's obvious to me."
B007HYMHEE The characters in this show are... well... different!  In a good way!  It is hard to believe what people leave in the storage lockers to be sold off.  Everything is bigger in Texas and some of the items found have big value to the trained eye."
B007HYMHEE NO way no more. how did it make it to a second season. never again. Dumb, just plain dumb. Paint drying would create more drama."
B007HYMHEE I thought this show was exactly like the original Storage Wars show. Everything seems the same, but the people on it. I believe the people on the original show is much better. They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show."
B007IQWYNK I love this show but was really upset with the officer looking into the elderly woman who was slain's case. As a law official he should know better than to bully a bank person into giving information on an individual while on the phone. They have strict laws in every state to protect people from fraud and identity theft. Just because cameras are there filming  you does not give you the right to supersede those laws. And to say to someone that they are helping a murderer, especially someone doing their job and following the law, is just ridiculous!! Shame on him!! I hope he watched this and learned from his stupidity!!"
B007IQWYNK I love the format of \"The First 48\" : there are no actors speaking for the perps, but the actual live as it happens people; you also get to see the disappointments of real cops - as well as the days in which they make their case!  When I think of \"The First 48\", I think of how it is the most real of the real-life crime shows presently out there - in fact, in alot of ways, it's not even comparable, \"The First 48\" is so top-drawer! - that said, you'd be surprised I don't watch too many of them!  Why?!  Because unfortunately most of the people who have crimes committed against them are people I can't even begin to identify with!  \"The First 48\" I'm guessing here in order to portray real-life cops in real-life situations doesn't wind-up with a whole lot of 'average middle-class' types that are willing to even be involved in this show ... until the Peggy Orissa home invasion murder.  Here is a middle-class, middle-aged woman who has worked hard for everything she has and someone wants to take that away from her - boy oh boy do I get this one!!!"
B007IQWYNK In one scenario, one conspirator kills his partner when his partner vomits after their crime.  They interview a man for the case and he has a looooong, John Kerry face, with scary-looking dreadlocks.  The facts seem to be an example of eating one's own.The other fact pattern is more intriguing.  Remember that a rapper said, \"Ladies is pimps too!\"  A young woman tries to act like a babe in the forest, but she's the one who masterminded the crime.  See the movie \"In Cold Blood.\"  There, two criminals kill a family based on assumptions that were absolutely untrue.  Here, half a dozen young people were trying to rob a man of $6,000, but he really only had $300.  The plan was for three females to strip in front of him and start dancing while a male would come in later and steal the victim's pants.  Though this was called \"Tiny Dancers,\" these chicks were quite tiny.  It's never explained why the shooter killed the man, rather than just rob him.  Still, it is just sooooo scandalous.  It points to how the youth can be naive and how conspiracies can lead folk down very dark paths.I liked this episode because it made me feel so indignant.  There was no reason for either murder and now young chocolate-y are going to do major time for this irresponsible mess.  It really has my wheels spinning and my head wagging."
B007IQWYNK Always an eye opener, my only beef is that they should try to have more cities in America.  Miami is getting old...."
B007IQWYNK I have watched probably nearly every episode of this show. I think it is produced really well. I tend to like the single case episodes best just because in a busy household it is sometimes hard to follow the two cases and catch when they are switching back and forth, but they are all good. There was a crazy episode #18 &#34;Dangerous Attractions&#34; in this years cases where the woman confessed to the crimes and it was one of the strangest things I had ever seen on the show. I like the hour long shows because it makes it easier sometimes than sitting down and watching a movie when there are other things going on. I think if you like reality TV then this is one of the best shows out there. Of course the annoying part is the summary of the case produced into the show to catch you up each time there was originally a commercial break, but if you can get past this then it is a great show."
B007JF83YY I enjoyed this show from the first one I watched and will continue buying the season DVDs to watch uninterrupted by commercials until they quit making them."
B007JF83YY A little over the top but aren't all reality shows?This is just plain good fun and silliness with actual good family values."
B007JF83YY They aren't afraid to share their views, and hold no punches. It may offend some, but if you want to feel refreshing honesty and see good family values hard at work, this is the show for you. Sure it's scripted and a bit cheesy at times, but I think each character is true to themselves, even during the scripted scenes."
B007JF83YY Absolutely love this show and I usually hate reality tv. This family is so funny it is better than most sitcoms on the air. Also love that they end each show with family and friends gathered around for a huge dinner and give thanks for all their blessings"
B007JF83YY I put off watching this show because it appears to be ridiculous.  Well guess what? It is. Ridiculously funny! I caught myself laughing out loud numerous times. This is a great family and a great show. I'm only sorry I didn't fall in love with them sooner."
B007JF83YY It's good, honest fun. Something you and your family can watch. You don't have to worry about seeing someone naked and feeling embarrassed in front of your mom."
B007JF83YY Unbelievably unique family with very cute grandkids. Just corny enough to make you laugh and no bad language. Good family entertainment with a conservative philosophy that does not match their appearance. They must be rolling in money if the spin off products in the stores is any indication."
B007JF83YY I wouldn't watch it for a long time. My husband wanted to watch it. I watched it with him and I loved it. It is very funny and you fall in love with the people."
B007JF83YY This is a family who is down to earth and loyal although sometimes get a bit carried away in some of their antics. So what? I love them all."
B007JF83YY The episodes have great fun in them for every member of the family.  They have great religious beliefs and great family values."
B007JF83YY Show promotes family values.  Yes there are many distractions, but the end of the day is family.  Happy, happy, happy"
B007JF83YY Although I&#8217;ve never, and probably will never go duck hunting, I loved this series.  Why, you might ask?  These sequences are created on a basic Founding Father concept:  Unity is Powerful.  In addition emphasis is placed on the first and original unity, the family.  Different as we all are even in our immediate family, we are major contributors to the success and accomplishments of this unit.  The family is we learn to cooperate for the common good.  Is this an easy task?  NO.  But it does work when it is practiced in all aspects of the family.  Great and needed lessons for our country!  Bob&#8217;s Girl"
B007JF83YY Had never seen Duck Dynasty before, but both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the Duck Dynasty season 1 episodes.  The entire cast are natural comedians, and we laughed and laughed.  To us, it was pure enjoyment, and we quickly became fans of the program."
B007JF83YY I am a pure city girl and for some reason this reality show I love!!! I love each person on the show and the old fashion moral and values the parents to the children uphold till this day knowing and having the knowledge that their son's and wives are changing with the times... including their children... and I love the end of each show how they always pray about the togetherness of the family  ... no matter what they went thru that day..."
B007JF83YY I thought it was going to be like most other reality shows but it's seriously funny!  some of it is scripted but it's all pretty good."
B007JF83YY There are a lot of reality shows that I enjoy. But not this one. This one is just not entertaining. I Watched the 1st two episodes and turned it off in the middle of the 2nd one.It's scripted and stupid.i.e. - They really want you to believe that the one brother (on his own) flooded out their loading dock so that ducks would come and they can test out their duck calls!!! Really!!!Even though the opening of the show, shows them at a local lake hunting ducks...with their duck calls.If they want to test their calls, why not just go to the lake? Instead they flood their loading dock, with a hose. That had to take a couple of days easily.Dumb show."
B007JF83YY We laugh at other people's lives.  No different from this show, calling themselves rednecks.  Amusingly, their lives are no different from ours.  It's just that they have adapted to their environment and the people they deal with.  The characters are likeable.  Lots of humor and a very funny show."
B007JF83YY This is so funny to watch especially when you know they are so rich and yet they are rednecks at heart and still catch their food and do alot of things theirselves while teaching the young ones how to keep the traditions."
B007JF83YY I started watching this on the recommendation of my sister, who couldn't tell me specifics about the show, but would always chuckle when she talked about it. I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it, but I thought I should watch at least one or two episodes to make a fair judgment. Once I started, I couldn't stop! These people know who they are and are laughing along with the rest of us. They have to have a lot of confidence in themselves to point out their foibles (real or contrived) to the thousands who watch the show. They remind me of good people I knew growing up who didn't take themselves too seriously. What a hoot!"
B007JF83YY This is a funny show of an everyday family that runs their own business but puts fun 1st. They also are not afraid to show their love of God and family through out the series"
B007JF83YY This show is so funny.  I love this family & wish I could be a part of it.  Not only that, but it is a tribute to what the American dream can be.  Who knew how well they would have it by just making duck calls for a living?  I give them lots of credit & major thanks for all the laugh.  It's rare to be able to laugh & watch a show & not be embarrassed if a child should happen to walk in & see the show.  Great fun & family entertainment."
B007JF83YY I absolutely love Duck Dynasty so i had to buy the season. I haven't watched it on the DVD yet but I know the episodes are good because I have seen them all on tv. I would definitely recommend this show."
B007JF83YY I found myself laughing outloud most of the time. Very entertaining, funny and life lessons. Look forward to see Season 2."
B007JF83YY I love this series. It took me awhile to get around to watching. I tend to automatically roll my eyes at &#34;reality&#34; tv. I think much of it is scripted versus reality. This series might have some scripting in it but I don't care. It is fun to watch. It feels like family. You may not always agree with the people in it and you may find yourself rolling your eyes but that is what family will bring out in you. It does include prayer so if love of God and country offends you, you are warned. I wouldn't let it stop me from watching though. You'll miss out on a lot. Just like you would if you miss out on family gatherings."
B007JF83YY from what ive seen of this show, it's funny and thats good."
B007JF83YY This'n (haha) show about a family biz that spreads 'hillbilly~teri~anism' all over yonder back 40 (acres or more) woods! The show has a great format, getting us introduced to characters that are real, and funny, which equals REAL FUNNY! The family has great morals, and even though the jest, and mess with each other have a deep love of family. Always a great moral, and life lesson at the end of each and every show. 'Hillbillies have ALWAYS been cool, nuff said' ~ Si. (sp?)"
B007JF83YY I didn't get a chance to see any episodes of Duck Dynasty until it became free with Amazon Prime, so I was quite a bit behind on the seasons when I finally got to see Season 1.  By then, Duck Dynasty had been out for a couple years and all I heard about the show was great things.  I knew I was going to like the show, but to be honest, I was hoping to see more about the business.  I gave it 4 stars because I do like the show, but I don't love it.  There is a lot of humor and that's about it.  It's Redneck humor, so it's much more enjoyable than most sitcoms.  They guys hunt and fish all the time, so it's right up my alley.  I really, really appreciate the Robertson family bond and loyalty to each other.  So, all in all, they are great people, doing funny things.  If you're looking to learn about how the Robertson's run a business, you won't find much.  I'll wait until the following seasons become free on Amazon Prime before I watch them."
B007JF83YY The only show on cable worth watching, I do not have cable, so I bought it, it is worth it."
B007JF83YY unkle si is very funny what a cariture and i love the way thay end the show with a prayer, keep this show on your scedule very family freindly"
B007JF83YY I love love love this show. I did not start watching it from the beginning but I caught one or two episodes on TV and really liked it so I watched season 1 on Amazon and I love every show. If every family were like this one America would be a really fun place to live in my opinion. Getting readsy to watch season 2 now. Hope it is as good as season 1."
B007JF83YY A reality show that is actually fun and interesting to watch. I enjoy all of the characters and they are all some real &#34;characters.&#34;"
B007JF83YY Love seeing the family interaction. It's nice to sit down with the family and know we aren't going to be slammed with bad language or sex or violence."
B007JF83YY While the show was kind of amusing, like in the first episode where they block a drain in the loading dock of their company to create a pond, without thinking of where trucks will unload; the entire premise of the show is highlighting the old stereotype of how stupid Southerners are. The Patriarch of the family who advises his grandson that it doesn't matter if his future wife is homely as long as she can cook, got my back up, and then the continuous portrayal of hunting for frogs ( a personal favorite animal of mine) beavers (another favorite) and on and on, put me off, and what might be kind of funny because the characters are so odd, just left me cold. I know people hunt to live, and there are regional specialties of the South(I live near Everglades and frog-legs are big here) I simply couldn't watch frogs having their feet cut off, skinned, etc. I almost want to take Season 1 home and give it just one more try, because there were funny moments I could identify with like when the snake falls into the boat from a tree(this actually happened to me once) and the guy goes over the side to get away. If I can watch vampires feed on people (ie; True Blood) and love it anyway, maybe I can get past all the \"political\" incorrectness by thinking of it as Archie Bunker meets Honey Boo-boo. I reserve my final analysis till after I view one more episode."
B007JF83YY Very funny show. Down to earth, good hard working people. If there is a disaster, I would want people like them as my family or friends."
B007JF83YY Very funny show.  Intelligent witty family.  I cannot afford the cost of the prime membership and to pay individually for the episodes.  But if they were included in my membership I would definitely watch."
B007JF83YY These guys epitomize the concept of good old redneck boys for me and the rivalry between the brothers and Sy is hard to beat."
B007JF83YY I just don't get the appeal of this series.  I watched some of it because of the hype, and as far as I'm concerned it was like watching paint dry.  I might have found it more interesting if it had been realistic: i.e., if there was a depiction of this well-educated but 'country' family who became wealthy though hard work and establishing their niche.  All the camo and ammo panders to those who want to see southern religious families as eccentric idiots.  These people are, clearly, good businessmen/women and the series left me...literally."
B007JF83YY Have a ton of fun with these rednecks as they have a blast while also trying to maintain a multi-million dollar duck call business.  While the show does at times seem a little scripted, it is good family fun being done in a way that has been missing for many years from the TV screen.  The combination of redneck humor and wholesome fun makes for good TV."
B007JF83YY In a day where most shows on TV are disgusting, this show is a refreshing change. I am glad it is on Amazon Prime."
B007JF83YY I love this show. I have not been watching it since the beginning since I don't have cable, but when it came to Amazon Prime, I have been all over it. Great show without the vulgarity of other more riskay shows. Good morals at the end and it is always good to see morality win over sexuality."
B007JF83YY This is the only show I have seen in a long time that makes me laugh out loud.  It makes you laugh but also gives reverence to the family and nature.  Yes, there is an occasional reference made to an adult subject, but it's never in a vulgar way.  Some of the patriarc's views are old-fashioned but you have to see the humor in them."
B007JF83YY We don't have cable or TV, so everything we watch is via the web. We were excited to see this show up where we could finally watch it.The show is hilarious, and it strikes a good balance between a reality show and a scripted comedy. It's like a modern day &#34;Beverly Hillbillies&#34;, actually. Every episode manages to stress the importance of the family, which is something our culture needs to hear."
B007JF83YY great wholesome reality. shows that not every family is obsessed with drama, drugs and profanity. what a treat to see a family that really does work together. even if some of it is staged at least it isn't bogged down with filthy language, actions and such."
B007JF83YY I'm a middle-aged woman and I can't say I actually enjoyed this show.  However, my husband and son really loved it.  It was interesting to see how they choose to live while being rich however.  The footage filmed in their kitchen almost made me sick to my stomach.  Not for the faint of heart."
B007JF83YY I really enjoy this show.  I was skeptical but it kinda grows on you.  I was watching it in HD on my new HDX 8.9 and the picture quality was outstanding."
B007JF83YY Immensely entertaining. Terrific view of a family working together, dynamics, attitudes. Love the interplay, like if you weren't family I'd fire you."
B007JF83YY People at work were talking about this show and so I thought I would check it out. I laugh during every episode.I highly recommend."
B007JF83YY I've only watched one episode.  Seems to me this program is moral, which goes a long way with me, but these guys are so eccentric that they don't seem real.  I may watch more episodes, but I prefer something more serious."
B007JF83YY We need more programs like this that show a real Christian family. The ideals and values displayed on this show is what makes The United States the great nation it is today... we need less Jersey Shore and more Duck Dynasty!"
B007JF83YY We loved Duck Dynasty!  People are craving good clean entertainment and this is it!  People drawn to  this show are a majority of Americans that honor God and their country."
B007JF83YY Authenticity is worth its weight in gold and is as rare as duck's teeth. This is some of the best viewing we've enjoyed in years! I can see why the Duck Commanders of \"Duck Dynasty\" own top television ratings. This gives hope about Americans and our values. We lived in wild places along the Canadian border. Back on the ranch, chicken-feed was stored in the antique copper moonshine still. Now, we're stuck in urban \"yuppie-land,\" as Phil Robertson, the Dynasty Godfather might put it. You gotta enter the \"Robertson Zone.\" It'll lift your spirit. What a treat to see folks celebrating old ways of living off the land, and making a success with their unique talents - this is one smart clan! \"I'm a jack of all trades and a Renaissance Man - ain't nothin' I can't do,\" rightfully declares Uncle Si after out-sewing the gals in making the delightful, voluptuous matriarch (and fine cook) Miss Kay an apron worthy of her attributes. Papa Phil likes a woman who can cook real food, with a little meat on her bones. He dispenses valuable advice to his grandsons on finding the right woman, \"When you're talking 'bout bees, dogs, or women, pain can come up on you real fast.\" That man has a voice made for listening to, he could say anything and make it compelling. He and his brother Si demonstrate the best use of golf balls I've ever seen. Jase, the frog's worse nightmare, nails it (as usual) with, \"Don't mess with another man's woman or his hat.\" Martin and Godwin are great too; ham samiches better watch out. Thank you Willie Robertson and clan for sharing with us!The three DVDs run approx. 5 hrs., 30 minutes total + extras. The Bonus Disk includes never-aired footage. So kick back and enjoy!Episodes:Family Funny BusinessCEO for a DayHigh Tech RedneckFrog in OneToo Close For Comfortleave it ti BeaversA Big Duck-ing CallSauvignon BeardPlan BeeDaddy's Got a GunFishin' for BusinessRedneck RoadtripWinner, Winner, Turkey DinnerWillie Stay or Willie GoBONUS Disk"
B007JF83YY it's nice to see a Christian base family on television again. that like to play with guns and fish.  We need more shows like this one. Philip Robertson is my hero."
B007JF83YY So funny! Uncle Si makes the show.... when he literally makes an apron for Miss Kay, I've never seen anything so funny! I've looked everywhere for season 1 of this show, and was so glad to finally find it on Amazon!!! I've heard rumors that there was &#34;bleeping&#34; done by the editors to make it look like the guys were cursing, when they really weren't. Well, that's not true! There was NO bleeping! Another funny episode was when Jase and Willie challenged each other to a fishing and selling challenge. Jase outfished Willie, but then, Willie had a contact who wanted a lot of fish..so, in the end they compromised and joined forces. It was a great season!!"
B007JF83YY I only watched the beginning of it and then realized it wasn't something that would appeal to me, so I stopped."
B007JF83YY I like the fact that these people are real. Other reality show give us an insight  into the lives of &#34;real people&#34;. Unfortunately what I've seen is a pretty disheartening. Too many people on reality TV are selfish, petty and dumb like the team on Survivor who decided to kill off a chicken to eat when there was a rooster in the cage. Chickens lay eggs, roosters don't. Other show us how thick they are on shows like the Amazing Race where contestants bicker and make stupid choices trying to win money. The duck guys do things with a dose of common sense which I like. If reality TV shows are indicative of average Americans we're in deep trouble. At least the people on Duck give me hope that not all Americans are dumber than a bag of hammers. Quack on Duck Dynasty..."
B007JF83YY Love Duck Dynasty, you can tell some is a little scripted, which they've admitted, but it's good, family friendly and hilarious!"
B007JF83YY I think it is a good show. Talks about values, family and other. Good show for anyone to watch. My Grandkids love it."
B007JF83YY I think there's a little Phil or Miss Kay in each of us.  What a wonderful family--they exhibit true Christianity in their dealings with each other.  We could all learn from that."
B007JF83YY I was so skeptical of watching this...didn't think it would appeal to me, but to my delight I enjoyed it immensely. Have recommended it to my husband. Lots of downright good advice embedded if you listen."
B007JF83YY This is a great show that I'm sure was meant at first to make fun of southern Christian folks.  It looks like it might have back fired though, because mainstream America loves the Robertsons!  So does my family.  We stand by Phil and the whole family. We love the series, and will continue to watch them wherever they go."
B007JF83YY Great show with a lot of good clean humor. They have a great family dynamic and are really fun to watch."
B007JF83YY My favorite part is the dinners at the end of each show.  Totally staged stuff, but funny anyway.  Laugh out loud."
B007JF83YY I enjoy watching this show.  It is clean and provides a great family time following! I am a people water and I enjoy learning about other people's prospective on life."
B007JF83YY I've been hearing so much great stuff about this show, and I decided to finally give it a try. It's really good and I love the family's values. It's nice to see a strong family on TV."
B007JF83YY I wasn't sure I'd like this show, but I do!  It's a little... redneck meets the Walton's and I love it.  Plenty of learning points along the way as they get into some crazy adventures."
B007JF83YY The show is just plain old funny, and reminds me of how my family and I interact.  Everything is in good fun, there is a lot of honesty, when the jokes are coming, and it is not a show that I fear my children to watch."
B007JF83YY I am a faithful watcher of this show when it is on even if it is a rerun and let me just tell you these guys and gals are funny and make me see what a REAL family could be like, thank you Robertson's for showing me what I can only dream of. Also keep up the good work and may several seasons be in our future."
B007JF83YY It's fun to get a glimpse into a totally different culture.  Glad for the Christian stand they take in some issues.  That's refreshing.  Some of the episodes are totally hilarious."
B007JF83YY I love Duck Dynasty!  Love the characters and love the prayer at the table at each meal.  The only thing I'd like differently is if Phil and Miss Kay wouldn't talk about sex quite as much."
B007JF83YY My husband watched this; he loves Duck Dynasty and will be watching all of them.  I watch when I can; they're very amusing."
B007JF83YY It's interesting to see these characters show who they really are behind the fancy clothes and money.I find it entertaining though sometimes I can't watch like when they show animals being prepared for meals."
B007JF83YY This November, A&E;'s popular \"Duck Dynasty\" is getting an actual DVD release.  While the show has been available to purchase for quite some time, it was previously being sold as a DVD-R on demand product.  That means that it was pressed onto discs when you purchased it as opposed to it being packaged for sale at a store near you.  Well, I guess they sold enough units to make it a viable DVD release because, for those that haven't experienced the show, it's coming out in a three disc set.WARNING:  BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHICH VERSION YOU ARE BUYING!  They are both still for sale on this site and all of these reviews are lumped together under both.  So read the description carefully if you want the new version with a Bonus disc of extra footage.Other than the extra disc, the Season One release still retains the fifteen episodes of the show's premiere year for a total running time of approximately 5 1/2 hours.  The DVD also has a Spanish subtitle option.In short, \"Duck Dynasty\" is one of the new brand of reality programs that adheres to a pretty expected format.  Shows that employ a similar formula can be found all over the cable airwaves on channels such as Lifetime, A&E;, and even History.  I mention this up front because, like many of its cousins, this is a show that you will absolutely love or violently despise.  It introduces the Robertsons, a Louisiana bayou clan that has built a sporting goods business empire called Duck Commander.  They are living the dream as an unlikely success story.  As you might anticipate, though, this family is populated by wacky eccentrics espousing down home wisdom.  Are you laughing with the Robertsons or at the Robertsons?  And does it really matter?As with the other shows in this genre, many of the escapades seemed designed for TV (as opposed to being natural).  Once again, though, I'm not sure that it matters.  The hook is that you want to see this clan (that you might describe as hillbilly or redneck) thrive in humorous ways.  Although everyone in the family is quite different, there is an underlying respect and love that makes this warmer and more affectionate than you might think possible.  Either the show is for you or not.  If you've never seen an episode, I might suggest catching one on TV where they rerun frequently or watching one on-demand here to see if it is to your liking.  And if you love the show, nothing else matters.  But remember, be careful which version of this product you are buying!  KGHarris, 10/12."
B007JF83YY Great show for the Robertson family, both to watch and see how they support each other and their rights. Love them, not the network."
B007JF83YY This show is hilarious with a touch of old time family values. We loved it! We will be purchasing season two next."
B007JF83YY Humorous. Light hearted and fun to watch. Clean show that you can watch as a family. I would highly recommend it."
B007JF83YY Love the show. I can see myself in different characters, family and friends in others.  The family dynamic is great in this show.  Faith, Family, and ducks, gotta love it."
B007JF83YY Quality show and safe and fun entertainment for the whole family.  There are not many shows out there that you can say this about.  A & E had better keep with this show or another network will have no trouble scooping them up into their line up. :)"
B007JF83YY This is a great DVD.  It is clear and has good sound.  The episodes are very funny.The product arrived in a safe package.  No problems with shipping.  It arrived ontime as stated.  I would highly recommend this product.  I also would not hesitateto purchase future merchandise from this seller."
B007JF83YY great family normalities! nice to see siblings doing normal things and makes the point about how different we all are even within the tight familyl"
B007JF83YY Again  it is Duck Dynasty and I really Love watching this series and the family working together and the Godly concept it is awesome and wished we had more like it.."
B007JF83YY This is typical American entertainment. Not really with it, but all that these great creators can come up with. Just watch the network channels and you will see the same crap."
B007JF83YY First reality show that I ever watched.  I know that reality is scripted - then filmed.  I enjoyed the stories and liked the people.  Watching a family that loves each other without negative events was delightful."
B007JF83YY My grand daughter absolutely loves Duck Dynasty and so we are watching it for about the 20th time, but it is a good show with good values and she could be watching some real junk, Duck Dynasty is good values show with people who though a little crazy represent all the is good in America today.  I do wish Amazon would carry more G, PG and PG-13 movies and TV programing it is hard to find good TV, its either murders or sex or both and bad language abounds even in the PG-13 so we end up watching a lot of Clean House, we've watched all of a lot of the series and find it hard to find new ones that we enjoy because they are so limited.  We do not and will not watch R rated and will shut off smutty PG-13.  So when we reach our limit on what Amazon offers we will leave it for another channel.  There must be someone who respects the adult viewer who doesn't care for R or close to  it TV"
B007JF83YY I am totally in love with some of the family members.  I find it a fun and entertaining show to watch."
B007JF83YY My husband and eight-year old grandson love this show.  They laugh a lot, which is good.  The show is growing on me."
B007JF83YY Love it!!! Wholesome fun! We watch it over and over again! Great for the whole family! Love the prayer and moral at the end!"
B007JF83YY They did what?????  LOL!  This is a lot of fun to  watch, but you also do a lot of head shaking while watching this series."
B007JF83YY I had heard a lot about Ducky Dynasty but had never seen an episode. Now that I've seen one, I can cross it off my bucket list and get on with life. Yes, these are nice people but all they seem to do is sit around and try to get out of working. Give me Billy, the Exterminator, any time. At least he does something."
B007JF83YY My in Laws are just like them when you come from the south you do alot of the same canning and living off the land alot you grow and hunt your way all year round this is just the best show I have ever watched showing that and funny to boot"
B007JF83YY Cute, predictable. Deserves five stars for family values, nostalgia. Conforms to tried true portrayal of clowns verses noble females. Tired of humor at that expense"
B007JF83YY I do not usually like 'reality shows', but this one makes me laugh.  Very canned and scripted.  Good clean fun."
B007JF83YY While the plot line is primarily &#34;comic&#34;, there is always an underlying course in morality and the &#34;right thing&#34;, that never ceases to amaze. Keep 'em coming!"
B007JF83YY Great show.  Love the close knit family.  Makes you smile over and over again. Feel good entertainment for the whole family."
B007JF83YY I haven't laughed this hard in a long time, and it's a totally family friendly show. Finally a TV family I wouldn't mind my kids seeing."
B007JF83YY I NEVER watch reality Tv shows but I don't consider this a reality show. It's good family values, good clean fun and hysterically funny. I would recommend it to anyone, and if you think these guys are dumb, you are sooooo wrong!"
B007JF83YY There are bunch of fun characters in Si, Phil, Jase, and Willie Robertson as well as the other employees of Duck Commander. There are some episodes that my wife and are almost in tears from laughing so hard. The content is wholesome and it is easy to look forward to each episode. Honestly we have binge watched the first two seasons over three evenings."
B007JF83YY Family bonding, fighting and fun. The duck dynasty family keeps the fun in family even when finding riches. Fun for the whole family"
B007JF83YY This show is hilarious. So many funny and endearing characters. I hope the subsequent seasons come onto Amazon Prime Instant."
B007JF83YY This review is based on the first four episodes.The show is obviously a hit now, but things weren't quite dialed in for the first four episodes. Too much seems contrived, or stiff, or unbelievable. They must take care of it at some point, but they haven't so far."
B007JF83YY Good clean family funWe can all enjoy it together and we all laugh at different things.I wish more under armour was worn... Not"
B007JF83YY Not often I give 5 stars to anything.  I love miss Kay,  nothing rattles her.The main male characters are priceless and not mean spirited.Brotherly horsing around at it's best."
B007JF83YY Never thought I'd like such a show but this just shows one what one can expect with great actors and good writing!  Both are a must for good entertainment and this is it!"
B007JF83YY I know this is one of the hottest shows in cable but I dont understand what all the hoopla is about, guess you just have to be a readneck?"
B007JF83YY I kept hearing about Duck Dynasty and wanted to find out what it was all about. This was a good introduction to the family and each role they play in the business and family."
B007JF83YY Great show my grandson  he is 9 just the it to. There is NOT ONE THINK THAT I WOULD CHANGE. I love that they put God as the main thing in the lives I love that there not afraid to live there life's with prayer, guns, and family."
B007JF83YY its is very unique show and very unusual family doing business a very low key way and making top notch dollars."
B007JF83YY This show is hilarious.  The antics of this family keep my family in stiches.And it is an easy to watch, positive, uplifting show."
B007JF83YY I wondered what all the excitement was recently when the show was threatened with cancellation. Then I saw the first episode. I think I am addicted as I watched the whole first season in two days. What a family. The one thing that stands out by not being present is the lack of profanity. Has some great moral values that many could do well to believe in. When is Season 2 going to be available on Prime?"
B007JF83YY Love their principles and values.  God fearing just like me.Good work ethic just like me.  This is my kind of show."
B007JF83YY While watching Louisiana rednecks isn't my thing, I have to admit that the Robertson clan have decent family values that they've instilled in their family and grand kids. The recordings are great to watch, since you don't have to put up with commercials and the first three seasons provided a neat gift for my daughter and her family."
B007JF83YY This show is really funny and family oriented.  Just started watching and now I'm hooked.  I love the fact that old fashion values and a family that actually loves and respects one another is such a hit."
B007JF83YY I actually didn't know the &#34;real story&#34; behind Duck Dynasty till all the recent publicity.  But the fact that the basis is true makes it even more comical and such a good opportunity to laugh at real life.  The humor reflects care, concern and love for each other while not being the least bit stuffy or hokey.  This is one of the greatest comedies since Red Skelton!!  Real laugh out loud humor.  And not afraid to love God at the same time.  Amen, I rest my case."
B007JF83YY Whether you share their particular beliefs or not let your inner red neck flag fly because this show is too funny to miss!"
B007JF83YY I'm not into reality shows. In fact, this is the only reality show I watch.  I heard something in the news about a remark 'Phil' made and I was wondering why all the hub-bub over this Phil's remark. Anyway, I find the show very entertaining.  You would never know these people are millionaires by their lifestyles.  They are true rednecks and proud of it.  I find the show amusing and fascinating.  They eat things like frogs and roadkill.  The wives are attractive, the men have unkempt beards, but their speech is very articulate. I get a chance to watch about 3 episodes a week. I'm almost done with Season 1 and ready to continue to the next Season."
B007JF83YY Wasn't sure we would like this show but it's entertaining for sure.  For a reality show centering around a famly of redneck Southern people who hit it rich by making a superior duck call.  Again, not too heavy but entertaining."
B007JF83YY I couldn't understand all the fuss about Duck Dynasty until I watched the first season. Granted, it has the same plasticity of other so-called reality shows, you know, the invented issues that make up the bulk of these shows. But what sets Duck Dynasty apart is that these are genuinely likeable people. Sure, I think it's overkill (no pun intended) for 5-6 men to all be shooting at one or two beavers and I don't understand the zen-like quality found in duck hunting or killing game of any kind, but aside from that, the people in the show are just likeable. They aren't anything more than what they are-- a bunch or rednecks who figured out the American dream, have become millionaires and still value family.I have NEVER watched the Kardashians and don't ever plan on doing so because they seem so full of themselves and seem as real as Bruce Jenner's face. But the Robertsons are kind of like the Waltons with beards. The season has some down-home wisdom wrapped up in fairly commonplace dilemmas and while it's hard to tell how much is invented for the cameras and how much is real, these people genuinely seem to be decent, God-loving people who value each other and living off the land. Yeah, they're also living off of the pile of goodies bearing their likenesses and beards found in the stores, but there's just something about Uncle Si's weird wisdom and the brothers' competitions and Miss Kay's home cooking that make you want to come back for more. There's just something about the Robertsons that make them seem like the oddball people in your neighborhood that carry shotguns but are pretty harmless."
B007JF83YY This is probably the most scripted &#34;reality&#34; show I've watched on the net.  The &#34;good ol' back woods swamp boys&#34; are about as authentic as a woman who has had implants and other plastic surgery, and has enrolled in a natural beauty contest."
B007JF83YY This show is great !! Once I watched the first episode , I had to see more. Very funny. And after each episode , the whole family sits down to eat and says grace. Cool."
B007JF83YY Duck Dynasty Rocks! and That's a fact, Jack!  Our family loves the Robertson's.  The show has fun, entertainment, and great family values.  Best show on TV (or Amazon Prime)!"
B007JF83YY Fun show with good family values.  Lots of stuff to make you laugh.  Just a nice feel good show. Love Phil and the advice he gives his grandkids."
B007JF83YY The show is unusual and intertwining. It felt good seeing family values as a priority even though the characters don't always agree. This is a very funny, intertaining series and I will continue to watch more episodes."
B007JF83YY My grandkids love it, so it gets a 5 star rating just for that. Always has an uplifting message at the end."
B007JF83YY I love this show. at first I thought another stupid reality show wtf. but I watched it and laughed my ass off"
B007JF83YY That is some funny stuff right there. Beverly Hillbillies strike oil, but then stay on their own land and build a mansion. The only thing they are missing is Elly Mae. Maybe there is a cousin who they can introduce for that role later on in the series. Si is my favorite. He is the hillbilly version of Yogi Berra with his witism's and slightly twisted folksy sayings."
B007JF83YY I gave this as a gift to my dad, and he loves it! He has watched it and has laughed his butt off!"
B007JF83YY This show was such a cute surprise for me who is not a &#34;hunting for sport&#34; advocate.  This did give me insight into families that do such a thing along with their values and their points of view.  Love the characters & family dynamics."
B007JF83YY I'm not a big fan of reality shows and I don't watch them regularly.  I saw 15 minutes of one episode and it was too much. Scratch this one off the list."
B007JF83YY I'm southern, so it's always nice to see a show that can be funny but still have family values and a strong belief in God!"
B007JF83YY Love having season one!  This show and amazon tv have an excellent selection of the best movies and shows of any other smart tv app"
B007JF83YY Common blue collar family turns hometown celebrity / millionaires in this series from A&E . If you haven't watched or seen it , you simply must to believe it , ONLY IN AMERICA ! Fantastic show which excellent family values far to often lost on todays children and entertaining for adults of all ages , sexes , races , religions , you name it , this show is simply 1 of the best things ever put on the tube ."
B007JF83YY It had its moments, I admit. Watching the more sensible family members react to the less sensible ones was amusing, but only mildly. I like redneck humor as much as anyone, and I don't regret watching one episode to see what all the fuss is about, but I've no interest in seeing more. The trouble is, it's not clever. It's zany and a little perverse, but it has to be clever to keep me coming back. This show has a tremendous following, of course, so there's clearly an appetite for this stuff, but I've got better ways to spend my time. If I were more of a drinker, I'd probably enjoy getting sloshed with some friends and guffawing at these real-life millionaire hillbillies. But I thought a lot of what I was seeing was scripted, or at least heavily edited to make it come out a certain way. But then, that's my general impression of so-called reality shows, of which I'm not a fan."
B007JF83YY I only looked at this program to find out what all the hype was about.  This program is not for me personally.  It's good to have choices of what you can look at; but this program will never be tuned in on my television again.  Different strokes for different folks."
B007JF83YY I am kind of surprised at how they don't seem to be affected by the cameras being around.  This is a good show and fine for children."
B007JF83YY A must see!!  These guys are great and so funny.  If you haven't seen the show, you really should take a peek, you'll love it."
B007JF83YY This show is funny and entertaining. Its amazing how one son takes the business from small to very successful.  Duck calls.....amazing!"
B007JF83YY This more than met my expectations. It is exactly what I anticipated receiving and is very well made. Should the need arise I would purchase this item again. Not only is the Roberston family funny and entertaining they are also very inspiring. Everyone should see this show."
B007JF83YY Christian based, Good clean fun along with a new way at looking at life and family that is so back to basics it makes you happy,happy,happy!! We need more of this kind!!!!"
B007JF83YY This show is the ultimate family show .... Faith, family and ducks.  Wouldn't it be a better if the country's people could embrace this philosophy.  I think we would be a better country.  PLUS it's so FUNNY !!!!!  You will laugh and cry.  A great TV show."
B007JF83YY he must like it cause i own a lot of episodes i watched one it was the chirstmas but  what season i dont know"
B007JF83YY Didn't care for it - just too stupid for me. Maybe if I watched more of it but so far it wasn't worth my time."
B007JF83YY I don't like reality t.v.  But I enjoy this show!!!  Only have watched season 1, but I find it heartwarming and funny at the same time.  Not many shows are funny anymore.  Will continue with season 2."
B007JF83YY Hokey for the sake of hokiness. I will continue to watch because I suspect that somewhere in my psyche lurks a redneck."
B007JF83YY Without going into a long-worded essay, this a fun family show.  I love it, watch it over and over again.  My wife loves it, and my kids love it."
B007JF83YY We really do need more shows about stupid white people because we really don't have enough.  I mean there in only 'The Real World&#34;, &#34;Jersey Shore&#34;, half the shows on the history channel.  I guess this is special though, it has hill billies in it."
B007JF83YY this is one of my favorite shows of all time and i love the actors and the what they do for a living it is great...."
B007JF83YY I watched this show one episode after another, and just got the biggest laugh and enjoyed every minute! I plan to buy all the seasons!!"
B007JF83YY I'm a redneck so of course I relate well with their humor and philosophy of life. Even if you're not of the redneck culture, you'll laugh throughout every episode."
B007JF83YY This is the first reality show I have sat down and watched and fell ga ga over !  I love this show maybe cuz , I grew up with 5 brothers of my own.  I get it."
B007JF83YY When a friend reluctantly said he watches this... I laughed and thought, maybe I should check it out before commenting. It was silly stupid fun.  It's a ridiculous show but light hearted and having known people just like them...I guess I can see why the rest of the country is taken with this family/friends."
B007JF83YY I personally didn't  care too much for this one. I mean it was ok and if I had watched more than just one episode I may have really like it . So I really can't be a good judge of this series because I didn't watch more than one of them. It seems to be popular from what I've heard other from other people. Give it a try yourself. You may like it."
B007JF83YY It is so had to find anything that is family friendly and has a normal Christian view point that is not just a Hollywood preconceived stereotype.  The show is fun and the people are having fun making others laugh, love God, and live life."
B007JF83YY It is a very funny and family friendly show.  You will never have to worry about allowing your children to watch."
B007JF83YY I watched this knowing it was going to be silly but entertaining.  It was definitely both.  It is very funny and even though some things seems scripted all the characters are genuine.  This is a great show for families and teaches simple lessons in each episode.  A LOT BETTER than other reality shows out there that focus on filming drama and issues to get ratings.  This focuses on the life of a &#34;redneck&#34;, family and values.  Great show!"
B007JF83YY Hey, look here Jack. I don't have cable, so its really nice to buy each series on Instant Video and watch when you want without commercials. I can get them A.ASA please.The family atmosphere is what we love about Duck Dynasty. They stay together."
B007JF83YY It comes in with excellent condition.  And it comes with 2 discs.  And this shows is very funny.  I also have season 2 and 3.  Am expecting Season 4 sometimes soon."
B007JF83YY Popular for a reason. Highly entertaining. Better than most reality shows. No over the top fake drama. You will grow to love these guys!"
B007JF8G9Q Both the making of the bread and the aluminum foil look like dirty processes.  They never show the foil being washed at any point. And the production line for the bread looks dirty as well."
B007JF8G9Q I remember years ago when this series came out on Discovery.  I liked it then.  However, I haven&#8217;t watched TV in almost a decade.  Sorry, I have more important things to do than watch &#8216;the box&#8217; (anyone know the reference).  I get time at lunch and each episode is exactly the time I have to eat.  Since I eat in a windowless box I might as well learn something.  Here you will learn things you may not want to learn.  You will enjoy it though."
B007JF8G9Q Each episode is fascinating.  It seems there is something interesting, no matter what is being made.  Informative, entertaining and brief.  A good way to kill 21 minutes."
B007JF8G9Q Love these little stories about how things are made. Great photography and editing. Calm Canadian narration, the show is interesting and yet relaxing."
B007JF8G9Q As of now seasons 1,2,3,4,5,8,9 are free for Prime members.  Seasons 7, 10, and 11 are not free, and there is no season 6.  I wonder if this was intentional.  I noticed that some of the descriptions of the episodes got truncated.  For example, season 1, episode 24 is described as being about \"aluminum pots and pans, artificial limbs, peanut butter and high intensity\".  It should have included \"high intensity light bulbs\".  There are other similar errors in the episode descriptions.  It's a great show."
B007JF8G9Q I find all of their programs very interesting.  At just 22 minutes per segment, they're great to watch at breakfast or any time you want just a short diversion.  The programs are always enlightening."
B007JF8G9Q It's always interesting to see how things we take for granted are made.  This series is okay but seems to be aimed at people with very short attention spans.  Mr. Rogers did a much better job on his field trips on his show."
B007JF8G9Q take for granted , some of the things or 'modern luxuries' these so first adorned trivial, mondaine, or simplistic things  are. But after seeing a 'How It's Made' episode, and how complex, and very interesting their makeup is ~ the show is a MUST watch, and a gem. Thank you 4 this show, educational, informative, and anything BUT mondaine! WE LOVE it! :^D"
B007JF8G9Q Having access to the episodes of this series is like having a technical library of manufacturing.  It not only satisfies ones curiosity about things about how things are made, it is a resource that can serve as an inspiration for invention and problem solving.  The videos are also an excellent teaching resource.  However you use these videos, you'll find that the accuracy and quality of the portrayal is excellent."
B007JF8G9Q I just love this show it is very interesting and informative. I like how they show you in detail how they make everyday products."
B007JF8G9Q Wanted something to watch when I needed a short break.  Found it to be a little dry at first, but the more I watch, the more I learn. Not bad!"
B007JF8G9Q I have always wondered how things are made and this show is great. I have learned a lot from this show"
B007JF8G9Q This is one great show about how inventive people can be--but the best part is being able to go show by show and findout about how something you are interested in is made."
B007JF8G9Q I really enjoy watching how things are made.The narrator keeps thing moving with many interesting facts to keep your mind focused."
B007JF8G9Q I love watching how things are made, It can be very surprising at times.  I find myself talking about it to friends.  Very interesting and informative."
B007JF8G9Q Love this show.  It's so interesting.  It's my go-to show when I can't sleep.  It relaxes me.  It's informative and interesting.  The narrator has a smooth delivery and the subjects are varied so there's something for everyone.  I also watch it with my 7-year old grandson.  He loves it too.  When one show is finished, he begs for another.  Glad there's something we can watch together and neither of us is bored."
B007JF8G9Q My husband and I like to watch this show because it is very informative. Also something to watch when nothing else on tv."
B007JF8G9Q How It's Made documentary series are awesome for anyone who needs to know how common items that we know and use everyday are made. If you are a person with 'inquisitive' mind then these series are a true goldmine of information. We never had cable TV before so I never came across these series before as they were aired on Science channel. I accidentally discovered these while browsing Amazon Instant video offerings for Prime Members.I have just finished watching Volume 1 and I do like it. It was very informative and I am sure you will like these series too. Having said, Some episodes are too crammed and combines various manufacturing techniques in very short period of time. The information is there but the depth is missing. But for inquisitive mind this is a good start. I hope future episodes will get better.Worth watching to satisfy your curiosity. Four stars! for Volume 1."
B007JF8G9Q love it!!!!! i used to have dish tv & WHEN THIS WAS ON I LOVED IT( DISH TO  MUCH$$$$$...SO WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON PRIME I SNATCHED IT UP....."
B007JF8G9Q I like this series. It's interesting, informative and fun to see what goes into the production of items we use every day."
B007JF8G9Q I Love this show. Extremely happy to find it on Amazon Prime.It is a safe show for children to watch and learn about everyday items.I have learned quite a bit watching it with my children.I am sad that there are not more seasons to watch.Netflix canceled the show."
B007JF9DB6 It's an interesting but very simplified explanation of how things are made. The cover 3 or 4 things in each episode so explanations are pretty simple."
B007JF9DB6 Who has never asked themselves how something is made?  I wish Amazon would find a way to get Made in America the series avaliable.  The one that took you from place to place showing how and where items were made in America."
B007JF9DB6 I just love the whole &#34;How It's Made&#34; series, no matter what they show, it is always interesting, fascinating and educational. The producers really know how to make everything interesting, and the camera work is excellent, especially when they show slow motion assemblies, amazing!"
B007JF9DB6 While I like seeing how things are made, this show is NOT really much about the how, so much as it is about the 'putting it together' after parts are already made elsewhere. They show us a few steps, while leaving out MANY others just as important if not more so than what they DO show us.  And thus, it's too short. WAY too short. Seeing up to four or even five 'things' made in 23 minutes? Come on! You can't expect me to know how a firetruck is built in only 1/4th of the whole 23 minutes!! Not even if they used all 23 minutes for that one item! It's far too complicated a build. They barely scratch the surface on almost everything. That's the bad. The good? Well, they DO have a wide variety of things that they get access to, and will sometimes slow down a critical process (Slow Motion) so we can understand it. That's what they are doing right. They do make explanations for some of what they don't show us... Though that's limited to statements such as: \"Now he will place in the pump, already built in another part of the factory\", or maybe another factory altogether. Likely, China, which they seem to avoid saying. That's 'The Putting Together of Already Manufactured Parts. AKA: This is more about 'Assembly! And NOT much about \"How it's MADE\"! I wonder if they think the audience isn't clever enough to understand it? I would pay for it, but not at the same price as say, a full one hour show on a single subject. I think pricing ought to reflect that. No wonder it's in the 'free' (with paid membership) to PRIME members... (Technically, that's NOT 'Free', but I quibble) Except newer shows, no matter their type or length, are (almost) always excluded from PRIME... Up to several years worth. (Usually three). This show ought to be part of Prime right up to yesterday. (If there was one aired yesterday, that is) Buy it at your own discretion. Personally, I want more detail and less \"How many things can we cram into 23 minutes\" kind of stuff... Could YOU build a light bulb in 23 minutes? Even WITH the equipment? I know, editing... Marketing. Argh! I think this show is 'dumbed' down to what they THINK is their audience's lowest common denominator. An insult to every one of US, who DO watch it, and really DO want to know: 'How DO They Make It'?"
B007JF9DB6 Somewhere in the middle of Season 3 of these series the Video presentation format got changed from 4:3 to wide-screen however the screen does not fully fit a 16:9 aspect ratio TVs and is seen to be presented in a 'windowboxed' format which I hated. I had to constantly flip my TV's aspect ratio to 'wide-screen fit' & 16:9 ratio between episodes. I even checked with my KindleFire tablet and that also suffered the same  Window boxed image quality which is why I am rating this with 3 stars. BTW Season 5 is awesome as it is available in Hi-Def!"
B007L8N42A This season of South Park includes some pretty funny episodes. Even though t
B007L8N42A Def some episodes are better than others, but still one of the best comedies on TV. I may have given it a lower star rating if doing a comparison to other seasons, but since I'm comparing it to the crapfest of other TV shows, deserves 6 stars"
B007L8N42A South park is a classic that I hope never goes away. This season is no different. It has the zip line episode where they go live action for a minute. Loved it."
B007L8N42A \"South Park\" has been one of the few animated television series that seems to have only gotten better with age. Every season, the show seems to improve a bit more. The animation of the show, despite being glorified versions of their construction paper cut outs from 15 years ago, has evolved drastically over the years and now features the likes of cel shading, computer animation, and even live-action segments. The writing of the show only gets more imaginative with each season as the show continues to put a viciously comical spin on current events, celebrities, and movies. It's taken 16 seasons to finally check out the show on Blu-ray. Even if you're a massive fan of the show, the mindset is that maybe the show doesn't really require fans to watch the show in high definition. But the show looks and sounds damn good in the format.\"The Complete Sixteen Season\" features all 14 episodes from season 16 in a sleek two-disc Blu-ray package (or three-discs for the DVD). While the Dolby True HD: English 5.1 surround sound is incredible, it probably won't be your preferred choice if you don't have an excellent sound system in your home. Viewing the series with this option on an HDTV with its normal speakers, the music and sound effects of the show are massively loud while the dialogue is a bit on the low side. Be sure to use the 2.0 Channel sound option to help resolve this issue.Favorite episodes include \"Butterballs,\" \"Sarcastaball,\" \"A Nightmare on Facetime,\" \"A Scause for Applause,\" and \"Obama Wins.\" \"A Nightmare on Facetime\" is the first Halloween themed \"South Park\" episode in six years, \"A Scause for Applause\" adds the \"South Park\" spin on Dr. Seuss and WWJD bracelets, and \"Butterballs\" is an exceptional Butters episode that revolves around bullying, Hollywood, and a certain act in San Diego.\"Obama Wins\" may be the season's crown jewel as it seems to cover so much and yet feels so effortless in execution. The endless supply of General Tso jokes helps, but most of the episode is carried by the election, \"Star Wars,\" and Morgan Freeman.Nearly every episode has its strengths or, like other \"South Park\" episodes you may not care for the first time around, become more enjoyable with repeat viewings. \"Reverse Cowgirl\" features one of the best one-liners of the season (\"Dude, you can't force me to wear a seatbelt while I take a dump!\") while \"Cash For Gold,\" \"Faith Hilling,\" \"Cartman Finds Love,\" \"Raising the Bar,\" and \"Insecurity\" are all solid episodes. The least enjoyable episodes are \"Going Native\" and \"I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining.\" The show has dabbled with live-action before, but the \"Ziplining\" episode may be the first time the boys have been portrayed as real people. So the episode is at least noteworthy for that reason.In addition to the Mini-Commentaries on every episode by \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the only other special feature are a little over four minutes of deleted scenes; the best one being one from \"Reverse Cowgirl\" where Jimmy tries to cheer up Craig with some stand-up comedy."
B007L8N42A a tedious episode but a great song that should be for sale on itunes and as a ringtone but it is NOT.The music video is absolutely adorable - about ten minutes into the episode but the episode itself is SO tedious. Butters is such a wuss so no wonder he has a creepy grandma in addition to having creepy parents.  Blech."
B007L8N42A Admittedly we're only 6 episodes in but sadly there's been a big drop in comedic quality since season 15. Something has gone sadly wrong this year where the normally sharp satire has been replaced with parodies of TV shopping networks, other TV shows and 'specials' that don't make any sense in the South Park universe (Cartman becoming Jewish?).I've been a huge fan of South Park for years, often wondering how they manage to maintain quality for such a long running show. But unless things improve soon, it looks like season 16 may be South Park's \"Simpsons moment\", marking the turning point where the show loses its edge. Are the best days still to come for Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman? Please prove me wrong."
B007L8N42A always good."
B007L8N42A OVERVIEW:  The premise of \"South Park\" was conceived by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker in the early 1990s.  Due to its viral-video success, Comedy Central picked up the rights to the franchise and aired the first episode of the adult animated series in 1997.  The cartoon garnered fame as one of the first shows to hinge its comedy on the use of crude language, satirical storylines, and dark humor.  Set in South Park, Colorado, the main characters of the show--Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick--often parody the childhoods of their writers.SPECIAL FEATURES of the Season 16 box-set include deleted scenes and \"Commentary-Mini.\"  If you have never watched the episodes with \"Commentary Mini,\" I encourage you to do so; the short commentaries from Trey Parker and Matt Stone are optionally run during the first three minutes of each episode.  Parker and Stone have used this method of commentary since the early seasons.  Their short introductions often expose insights behind particular jokes, further multiplying the laugh count.SEASON 16 kicked off in the spring of 2012 with fourteen episodes, each written during the week before broadcast.  In true \"South Park\" style, some of the pop-culture references of this season include:  bullying, zip-lining, \"scause\" armbands, voting, the Lance Armstrong scandal, NFL nanny regulations, BlockBuster/Netflicks, airport security/TSA, Honey BooBoo, Amazon addiction, native Hawaiians, memes, Easter/Passover, obesity, and TV shopping networks.  I have been a fan of \"South Park\" since its beginning and religiously purchase each season; however, I feel that the show's wit and charm has been in a slump since season 14.  While I still find the show highly entertaining, much of the recent comedy has felt `forced.'  I am happy to say that the writing seems to pick back up in Season 16 and is nearly fully-operational by Season 17.Episode 1:  \"Reverse Cowgirl\"--New laws governing potty time emerge as backlash to Clyde's inconsiderate bathroom behavior.  The tyranny upsets loggers, thinkers, and top-of-the-tank readers alike.  Can toilet pioneer John Harrington set everyone straight?Episode 2:  \"Cash for Gold\"--When Stan's elderly Grandpa gets swindled by a shop-from-home network, Stan sets out to make things right.  Cartman, on the other hand, capitalizes on the `cash for junk' market.Episode 3:  \"Faith Hilling\"--The boys struggle to stay ahead of the competition for the newest internet memes.  The war turns to survival of the fittest; who (or what) will be `T.he  Swift.est' to adapt?Episode 4:  \"Jewpacabra\"--Cartman warns his friends to avoid the South Park Easter Egg Hunt due to video footage he captured on a strange monster.  To stick by his charade, Cartman becomes obligated to face the beast alone; his only hope lies in prayer for a Passover Miracle.Episode 5:  \"Butterballs\"--Butters becomes the victim of a ruthless bully.  Stan quickly volunteers to be the creator and star of a new anti-bullying video, and he won't let anyone stand in his way.Episode 6:  \"I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining\"--To make the most of their spring break, one of the boys suggests going ziplining.  The adventure is long, uneventful, and irritating....  But when an attempt to escape goes wrong, stuff gets REAL.  Will all four boys make it out alive?  And, more importantly, WHO had the bright idea to go ziplining in the first place?Episode 7:  \"Cartman Finds Love\"--The new girl in town turns Cartman into a giddy, love-struck matchmaker.Episode 8:  \"Sarcastaball\"--After the NFL implements safety-related rule changes, Randy offers his opinions through sarcasm.  When Randy takes a mouthful of Butters' secret weapon, he finally learns to calls things as they are.Episode 9:  \"Raising The Bar\"--Along with the rest of the country, Cartman begins to own his unhealthy and trashy lifestyle; the fate of all integrity is left in the hands/mechanical arms of James Cameron.Episode 10:  \"Insecurity\"--When online shopping invites delivery men into the home, Kyle begins to worry that the `regular deliveries' are actually services to his mother's infidelity.Episode 11:  \"Going Native\"--Butters hits a stage in adolescence marked by unruly behavior; it is a sign that reveals the truth of his origins.Episode 12:  \"A Nightmare On FaceTime\"--The Marsh Family takes over the South Park BlockBuster, forcing Stan to miss out on trick-or-treating with his friends.  As Randy tries to resurrect a dying business, Stan finds a way to join his friends, in costume, through FaceTime.Episode 13:  \"A Scause for Applause\"--When a famous idol is accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, the world loses faith as well as their supportive wristbands.Episode 14:  \"Obama Wins!\"--Cartman sets up an elaborate extortion scheme that holds the result of the 2012 Presidential Election hostage."
B007L8N42A Very funny adult humor, kids shouldn't see but it's great for adults. They seem to keep up with current event very well."
B007L8N42A South Park continues to crank out the seasons & still manage to feel fresh I love the &#34;Raising the Bar&#34; & &#34;A Nightmare on Face time&#34; episodes."
B007LVT9SA In this, the 5th and final season, Mary has many new experiences and learns to accept help from others as her independence is challenged with her newborn.  This season wraps up relationships including her distant father."
B007LVT9SA We love this show! My husband and I started the first season on Netflix and ended up having to watch the fourth and fifth season on Amazon. It is a great mixture of drama and suspense. It has the action and suspense from Mary Shannon's job of being a US Marshall and helping relocate witnesses who hand joined the witness protection program along with the drama for her typical dysfunctional family. It is all around a good, clean show."
B007LVT9SA I HAVE ENJOYED THIS SHOW AND COLLECTED THE OTHER YEARS, THIS WILL FINISH MY SET AND I CAN WATCH IT AGAIN WHENEVER"
B007LVT9SA Mary learns a few things about herself. Mary rips a few new orafices with classic Mary spectacular venacular. This episode is strong stuff. Just her face in the mirror when she was emotional shows you this woman can act way past the snappy banter....."
B007LVT9SA I really enjoyed this whole series.  I like series that have strong female leads and this one was great.  I am very sorry to see it end."
B007LVT9SA If you like this series, then, of course buy it. The only problem I had was that it was only eight episodes long. And I attribute this to the fact that Mary McCormack had her third daughter in the real life and wanted to spend more time with her.If it had been a full 12 or 13 episode season, I would have rated it 5 stars."
B007LVT9SA I vaguely remember this episode.  I usually like this show.  I would like to say that now that it's after the fact, I was really left disappointed and feeling empty after the series finale.  Really, they could have done better.  Why tease us all these years with a possible Mary, Marshall get together only to rip it away?"
B007LVT9SA In the episode \"All's Well that Ends\", the fifth season and the series \"In Plain Sight\" wrap it all up.  U.S. Marshall Mary Shannon must contend with the protection of one last WITSEC person, a comely young model adjusting poorly to hiding out in New Mexico.  Mary must also deal with the consequences of her long-missing criminal father's intrusion into her life.  Finally, Mary must make serious plans for her own future with her baby as her office is threatened with closure.  And, her long-time office partner Marshall needs to talks to her about something...This is perhaps too much burden for one episode.  The witsec issue gets resolved in the usual timeline.  The issues created by Mary's father are untidy and their resolution is also less than tidy, even if there is a measure of redemption for both father and daughter.  Mary comes to terms with her disfunctional family, after a fashion, and there are indications at the end that Mary intends to press on with her life as it is.  There is an effort to wrap up the stories of the leading characters.The least satisfying aspect of the episode, for this reviewer, was Mary's fateful conversation with longtime office partner and virtual soulmate Marshall.  Previous episodes this season suggested both Marshal and Mary knew he wasn't entirely free to just ride off into the sunset with his fiancee, due to his attachment to Mary.  This could have been a life-changing moment, but instead of champagne, we got warm diet soda and this long-time viewer was disappointed.  But you have to see it and draw your own conclusions.\"All's Well that Ends\" is highly recommended to fans of the series."
B007LVT9SA I feel this is a great TV series and just want to keep my collection complete. If you haven't seen any of the show try season 1 and check it out for yourself."
B007LVT9SA In plain sight has been one of my favorite shows since the first episode. Now I finally have all five seasons. I love Mary and Marshall so much.  I hate that they only had five seasons. It is a awesome show."
B007LVT9SA This was one of the best series on TV and I really hated to see the series end. Really Good!"
B007LVT9SA I don't understand why they took it off the air!  Would love to see how Marshall Mann runs the office and how Mary''s life turns around AND who's Squish's baby's father?  Is it  Peter?  Will they get back together?  She's not as far away from his lowly beginnings as she thinks.!"
B007LVT9SA Networks seem to love to get things wrong. Why would they end such a beautiful show with great actors. Anyway I loved to hate those we were suppose to hate and the acting of Marshal and Mary were usually spot on great. Sometimes it's hard to get all those words out. I read however that Mary's real life counter part was saying it was time to wrap it up and move on. As she put it she had one tiny baby when the show took off and now she has three. One baby was easy to manage but three not so easy. She then went out and signed on with another series? I think it's a comedy. Lets hope they agreed to give her time with the kidlets. Marshal & Mary one of the best all time TV pairs.Of course you can't get it back...and no other network picked it up to continue this ride. We only discovered it from great reviews here on Amazon and bought all 4.5 DVD years at once. So it's been a wonderful marathon romp while we ingore all this time of year re-run season on regular TV.I think these two main actors worked well together and some of the other supporting actors and characters they played werefantastic. Especially Stan, just give that man a hand. Kinda makes you wish you had such great male support in your world. Of course if I did then I would know I had lost my sense of reality as this is just that a MAKE BELIEVE SHOW. Unlike one-one star-reviewer here who seemed to be having a melt down and couldn't grasp reality that it was just that a fake show presented only for entertaining the masses. All his emotional buttons seemed to have been punched at once.  There is counsel for that if he realizes it or not. I wish him well but maybe a little less investment of the personal kind in TV.For the rest of us fans....definitely going to be re-visited along with The Closer and Mash and Bones which is still being made and Burn Notice. What do these shows have that make them so endearing and lasting...it's the writers and actors who built up the relationships between the key characters. Dragging us fans into and along for the wonderful ride. So many shows fail because they seem to miss that key to what works and makes for that special kind of ride. And a lot of kudo's belong to the writers and the actors. In this case the acting was amazing. Gonna miss Marshal and Mary but hope their REAL Life PEOPLE enjoy their future path and each lands another great role or two or three. But WOW you got it right this time. And thanks for those WOW's. You had us from the first premier show right through it's a wrap episode. Wish the DVD's had a few more laugh tracks and bloopers as there had to be some fantastic oops by the cast members in the making of In Plain Sight.(See fellas being a Jerk isn't exclusive to Men only...sometimes Networks play that role well. Think Fire Fly and Moon Lighting a few years back too. But I do appreciate that as fans we have 4.5 years only wish they were 20 episode years. :))) ;)))"
B007LVT9SA I find it interesting to see the potential areas of how life would be affected by witness protection.  Following the lives of the base characters and the twist and turns they take keep me entertained as well.  Good acting without being too heavy."
B007LVT9SA I loved this show and am so disappointed that it is discontinuing.  The relationship between Marshall and Mary is so captivating.  I have to say I didn't like the way it ended, but was glad that it did have an ending and wasn't a cliffhanger."
B007LVT9SA ...so now I can see it whenever I want.  I used to transcribe certain of Mary's musings...they were poignant or funny or just an astute commentary on human nature.  It was a shame it was taken off the air, but I will say, they did one of the better jobs of wrapping up the storylines in a way that made sense and showed us what the characters would be doing in the future.  So many shows are abruptly cut off or stopped in the middle of a storyline that was supposed to be a lead-in for the next season, or even had the main character killed off...The writers and producers of &#34;In Plain Sight &#34; did it very well.  Excellent series and I miss having new episodes, but I can now revisit whenever I want."
B007LVT9SA I don't know how they got such a good cast of characters but they did.I will miss the program.  Mary and Marshall Marshall were the best."
B007LVT9SA I really enjoyed this show for 4 seasons but this final season was a mistake, the actors are off center and lost the flow, as it seems Mary did have a baby in real life it, which  squashed the show , a complete opposite of character Mary. Congrats on her new baby but she needs to and did move on, I only saw the first premier episode, which was painful to watch, Having hard in your face Mary turn into a fake hard Mother while goggling her baby, Looked like she did use her own baby which would be cool, anyway its conflicting in her devotion to the job of Marshall,to bad her partner and her didn't get together, everything ends, Good Luck"
B007LVT9SA Mary McCormac is brilliant in this series. Too bad it ended so soon. Only 5 seasnons, and the 5th season ended after only 8 episodes."
B007LVT9SA I was sad to hear that In Plain Sight was ending but the show was always enjoyable to watch and as any tv show goes, all good things must come to an end."
B007LVT9SA Mary and Marshall Marshal have been hiding those people so well for years now. Love the series and the interaction between characters."
B007LVT9SA This is a really nice show that did not last as long as it should. Try hard not to miss it."
B007LVT9SA Mary is the woman that many of us want to be. She is strong, but deals with things straight on. She does not duck when things get hard. Her family is made up of colorful characters, her crazy mom, her sister who struggles with things, but looks to Mary for help. But her best relationship is with Marshall, her partner, her only true friend and in most ways her equal. He does not back down from holding her accountable.It is a serious show that laughs, and is like most people's family. I love this show and can't wait to see what will happen next."
B007LVT9SA If you haven't purchased this yet, don't bother. As another reviewer wrote, Season 2 was probably the best, but it was slowly downhill from there. This season hit the bottom. Minimal effort on all fronts."
B007LVT9SA The only reason I don't give this five stars is because the series ended too soon and not at all the way I had hoped.  But every episode was a lesson in how a TV series should be done.  Great acting."
B007MHB990 For giving us the opportunity to see these wonderful shows all in one place, and pass the Love of Lucy on to the next generation!"
B007MHB990 My six year old daughter and I love to watch these together.  I feel as though it is more appropriate then any Hannah Montana or anything else kids are watching these days and the show gives us all sorts of things to talk about from history to clothing.  this show is so fun and I love sharing it."
B007MHB990 As usual Lucy gets herself in trouble, but this time Ricky also gets caught up. Always funny, that's why \"I Love Lucy\"!!!!"
B007MHB990 I watched the program and enjoyed every moment of it.  the clarity is great.  It is so nice to watch TV from waaaaay back.  Thank you."
B007MHB990 Not before nor since, has there been anything as funny as I Love Lucy!  PS The fact that I am supposed to continue to comment after I have said all that was needed to say is just silly"
B007MHB990 Whenever I need a good laugh, Lucy is a sure bet.  60 years later and this show is still relevant among the young and older generations."
B007MHB990 How can you ever go wrong with I Love Lucy?  This will always be one of the best shows ever made."
B007MHB990 There is no reason NOT to watch I Love Lucy.  You have a comedic genius in Lucille Ball, with a great supporting cast and wonderful writing.  It is funny, touching and stands the test of time."
B007MHB990 I enjoyed the shows and now every time I try to access one it says c content not available this is not the show rather something with Amazon"
B007MHB990 You can't beat Lucy. This show is so much fun to watch and anyone can watch it. You don't have to be afraid the subject matter is risqu&eacute; for your children, because it won't be. You can watch the same show 4 times and get laughs each time. Just watch each character; look at the facial expressions, etc. and enjoy the show!"
B007MHB990 Who can deny that these shows are so part of this country's history.  How many times do we do a &#34;Lucy&#34; line during the day?"
B007MHB990 This show brings back some memories but it is still a very good and very funny show and its amazing to see that people's problems are still the same with so many year between."
B007MHB990 I absolutely love this show!! Brings back lits of memories of watching it with my mother & now I have created new memories watching it with my son!! The best!!"
B007MHB990 If you want to laugh then watch Lucy, you're guaranteed a laugh. There are episodes I actually haven't seen. I thought I had seen all the episodes of Lucy. But even the episodes I have seen before still made me laugh all over again.I feel like Volume 2 was funnier than Volume 1. But don't leave Volume 1 out of the loop, its interesting to see the first episodes and where it all began. But definately, Volume 2 is better!"
B007MHB990 Great show! Hilarious too. Lucy keeps getting into trouble but usually learns a good lesson. Love the depiction of mid-1900s Americana!"
B007MHB990 This is a great show where the couple are a solid family.  There is no sneaking around or drug use it shows family values and in the end a love for each other."
B007MHB990 Well, Amazon doesn't make many errors. I didn't purchase this but rather watched it. This is classic 50's & pure genius from Ms Ball & cohorts."
B007MJSPJA Rebecca (Sarah Bolger) and her best friend Lucy (Sarah Gadon) reunite for another year at a private boarding school. They've waited all summer to see each other again. They are introduced to a new girl named Ernessa, who seems a bit strange. Lucy is drawn to this new student, quickly becoming her constant companion. Rebecca grows steadily more suspicious of Ernessa, especially her apparent power over Lucy. Is Rebecca correct, or is she simply being paranoid? Could she just be jealous of Lucy's sudden interest in Ernessa? It doesn't help that she's reading CARMILLA in class, a book about vampirism and possession. Still, bizarre things are happening, and Rebecca is haunted by Ernessa's hold on Lucy. Meanwhile, tragic events and &#34;accidents&#34; occur, drastically thinning out Rebecca's friends and school faculty. Can she get anyone to help her before Ernessa destroys everything? THE MOTH DIARIES is a neo-gothic horror film filled w/ teenage anxiety mixed w/ supernatural mystery. Dark and fascinating..."
B007MJSPJA When the new girl in school starts to come between Rebecca and her best friend, Lucy, she begins to suspect that there is something far more sinister behind their relationship. Rachel Klein's modern update on traditional Gothic storytelling is brought to life in Mary Harron's screen adaptation of THE MOTH DIARIES, from 2011. Rebecca and the other girls transpose their teenage anxieties like anorexia, depression, suicide, and sexuality on to their ghostly classmate as a means of dealing with their internal struggles. While Ernessa may not be seen physically drawing the blood from her victims, her presence at the school certainly saps the other girls of their strength and happiness, leading them in to despair. The lesbianic undertones that are present in the plot also draw strongly from the classic tale of Carmilla, which is frequently referenced throughout the girls' schoolwork. Harron takes a timely approach in developing the characters and mood of the picture, but unfortunately, her deliberate pacing begins to wear during the long periods of inaction and leaves the audience feeling deprived as the film draws to its anticlimactic ending. Still, we are left on a positive note, having grown with Rebecca as she overcomes her pain and loss to find a renewed strength in herself. THE MOTH DIARIES ultimately falls short of becoming a modern classic, but it does provide another unique and emotionally charged vampire tale in the same vein as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
B007MJSPJA This movie wasn't too over the top with language, adult sexuality, or gratuitous violence. I think it was a fun movie for families with older kids. I love horror, but there are only so many movies we can watch as a family. This one fit the bill. It has some fun twists and turns."
B007MJSPJA Rebecca is happy to reunite with her friends as she returns to school, after the death of her father. Her best friend in this boarding school for young girls is Lucy, until Ernessa enters the picture and destroys the friendship. Rebecca takes it to heart, but then develops a crush on her English teacher as she immerses herself in a Gothic Vampire novel, while becoming convinced that Ernessa is a Vampire, and the drama becomes intense. Rebecca decides to get rid of Ernessa with feelings of mixed-emotions. The drama turns into horror as the bodies of young girls begin to multiply with danger in the air. The haunting story is creepy, chilling, and filled with anxiety. Passion turns into fear with heart-pounding suspense. Highly Recommended for Horror lovers!"
B007MJSPJA typical vampire themes except that in this case the vampire is a girl in an all girls preppy high school. You have your typical sexual tension between the vampire and the girls plus tension between the heroine and the only male teacher in school. ending was predictable"
B007MJSPJA Wonderfully well told story and you can believe every bit of it. I watched it originally because of Sarah Bolger having been in The Spiderwick Chronicles, and I wasn't disappointed."
B007MJSPJA Feminist filmmaker Mary Harron has made some bold and provocative choices in past films such as \"I Shot Andy Warhol,\" \"American Psycho\" and \"The Notorious Bettie Page.\" She is not afraid to push things to the edge of reason and watch them topple over with an in-your-face glee. So I'm shocked by the tepid and somewhat unfocused \"The Moth Diaries.\" The film seems to be borne of some interesting ideas, but it never effectively builds in intensity. The picture is lovely, to be sure, with breathy performances, gauzy flashbacks and ethereal fantasy sequences--but does it amount to much? I didn't think so. Pretty, but empty. That's the first phrase that popped into my head as the credits started to roll. Taking a popular young adult novel by Rachel Klein, Harron's choices here appear content to ape the underdeveloped emotions inherent in the Twilight saga as opposed to creating something that felt distinct or unique.Set in an all-girl boarding school, \"The Moth Diaries\" opens with an introduction to Rebecca (Sarah Bolger). A troubled girl rebuilding her life after a tragedy, she is really getting back into the swing of things with a close knit group of friends. A creepy new student (Lily Cole) starts to worm her way into the group and strange occurrences abound. Is Rebecca justifiably suspicious of the new girl? Or might it just be jealousy? After all, she is losing her best friend's devotion to this exotic new rival. With vampire allusions aplenty and some seemingly supernatural sightings, we're left to wonder what is real and what might be the imaginings of the increasingly distraught Rebecca. The solution, when it arrives, is neither particularly shocking or even interesting. As the entire film unfolds in one monotonous dimension, no suspense is ever really derived from the tale.I think the fundamental issue is that lack of adequate character development. All of the girls (and even the staff) start to be affected, but I wasn't invested in any of them. As such, it became hard to care about their respective fates. It doesn't help that the picture has a sporadic (and deadly wooden) narration by Bolger or that a poorly handled subplot involving a male teacher (the likable Scott Speedman) halts the forward momentum of the narrative. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the film is the Sapphic subtext as the girls form unnaturally close bonds. As alluded to in the movie, gothic tales such as this always have sex, death, and blood. After proclaiming this, though, the movie shies away from this aspect and leaves it largely unexplored. Harron opted to stay in the tween angst realm in this adaptation and the movie lacks an edginess that might have upped the danger and excitement. I didn't hate \"The Moth Diaries,\" if anything I'm apathetic about it. It might very well have made a great movie, but everything feels thoroughly undercooked. About 2 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 8/12."
B007MJSPJA How can you beat that combination?  This is an appropriate film for young adults, not so much for us older folks.  But it's stylish and well-produced, with good acting and a minimum of hokiness considering it's basically a vampire movie.The vampiress, Ernessa, who looks like she's post-Barbie doll plastic surgery--manages to convince classmates in a girl's school situated in a former hotel to disappear in various ways in order to get to the one girl who interests her the most, Becca (for a specific reason that I won't reveal).  Nobody but Becca notices that there's something strange about her.  Ernessa is not evil so much as needy for certain things, trapped in an existence she doesn't want but is stuck with. In the end, Becca comes through for her in a messy but very pragmatic way, her blood supply intact (maybe that's what Ernessa was planning all along, clever girl).  Happy ending."
B007MJSPJA THE MOTH DIARIES looks nice, creating Gothic atmosphere in a modern setting.  Ultimately, though, it's a hollow and uninspired film.  Is Ernessa a true vampire or does Rebecca create her fears to eradicate herself over guilt she feels from her father's tragic death?  The movie's failure to support either scenario results in an uneven film resulting in a disappointing conclusion.The cast does well, but the romantic subplot with Rebecca and the handsome professor has no real impact on the film.  MOTH DIARIES is another example of style over substance."
B007MJSPJA Teenage angst is a fairly common theme in books and movies these days, and I must say this one was done quite well.  At first blush it feels as if the movie is slow paced and simply plodding along, until you allow your mind to wander and you realize all of the subtle nuances your subconscious has been picking up.  This movie is more than a simple girly teen flick, there is psychological impact inside of this story.  Lily Cole was excellent in her role as the new girl; she portrayed a definite creepiness, using minute facial movements and deadpan stares that were still filled with menace.  Sarah Bolger did a wonderful job in her role, and left me wondering if she would find the strength to deal or if she would crack up; I would have liked to see more of Valerie Tian and Melissa Farman, too. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it."
B007MJSPJA Wow,so theres 2 Tim's who reviewed this movie ? I normally review 3d only but I also love horror movies.One of the reviews called it right,\"a vampire movie without fangs.\"I think if you get past that,you might like it.First,it is very well done and has some creepy parts.The other reviews say it all...girls private school,new creepy girl arives,people start dying,one girl suspects new girl of being a vampire.I would advise renting it(as I did),not buying it.I liked this movie.Not cheesy,well done."
B007MJSPJA \"It's like she's invading my mind, even when I'm alone I can't escape her.\" Rebecca (Bolger) is ready for her new school year to start. After the death of her father she is grateful to get back to her friends. She is surprised when a new girl, Ernessa (Cole) shows up. What starts off as a new girl trying to make friends turns into something much more dangerous and Rebecca becomes suspicious of her when her friends turn up missing, or dead. I will start by saying that this movie 
B007MJSPJA Rebecca (Sarah Bolger) is a student of an all-girls boarding school. The 16-year-old girl is also a daughter of a famous poet who died a tragic death. Thanks to her best friend and roommate Lucie (Sarah Gadon), Rebecca almost recovers from the past when a new student Ernessa (Lily Cole) arrives.Rebecca thinks there is something strange about Ernessa (who is never seen eating anything). With the arrival of his beautiful and mysterious girl, Rebecca's friendship with Lucie starts to wither. Not only that; weird things start to happen, but is this because of Ernessa, or just a figment of Rebecca's wild imagination?I have not read the original book by Rachel Klein, but the story is obviously inspired by \"Carmilla\" (1872), a novella written by Sheridan Le Fanu, and to a lesser degree, Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" (1897). I believe the original story has several subtexts as in these Gothic classics, but screenwriter/director Mary Harron (\"American Psycho\") handles these elements clumsily.The film feels rushed in many ways. The three characters Rebecca, Lucie and Ernessa are not fully developed. Rebecca's relationship with the school's handsome English teacher (Scott Speedman) doesn't convince. This is supposed to be a dark fantasy with a heroine who is not entirely reliable, but the film itself lacks wit or psychological insight, anything that would make the predictable story interesting.Having said that, I still enjoyed watching the film for what it is, especially Declan Quinn's moody photography and impressive Lily Cole, perfectly cast as the enigmatic Ernessa."
B007MJSPJA This is a good movie with some really good acting.The director is trying to keep us guessing all through the movie if there is a vampire around us.The story is a usual boarding school/college roommate problem with a spice. Rebecca shows up after summer vacation for her second year in a very selective boarding school. Her father, a famous poet, committed suicide several years ago and she still hasn't recovered. Her roommate (Lucie) for two years is very supportive and acts as her family in the school. All is well until mid semester a new student (Ernessa) arrives at the school. She takes over Lucie's life who drops Rebecca and now follows Ernessa all day long. Lily Cole (Ernessa) provides a stunning performance. She is really mysterious and she moves like a vampire. The acti
B007MS58AA My complaint is that they didn't show Les cleaning the turtle and snake.  Even if he didn't want to show that on TV, I'd hope he filmed it to include in a non-TV version of the show; I'd like to see how it's done.  I really enjoy the harmonica playing and all the survival tips, like how to make fire by rubbing 2 sticks together, and how to prepare grasshoppers to eat.  In this series there is no \"fourth wall\"; i.e. Les is constantly talking with the audience.  Besides that, there is no attempt to hide the cameras.  This series is about survival, but it's also about filming a show about survival.  Les doesn't just have to show how he climbed up a hill, he has to set up the camera, climb the hill, then walk back down and get the camera!  Plus, he has 50 pounds of camera stuff to haul around.  Les seems like a pretty smart guy, and I'll bet he has enough footage to make a whole show without talking to the audience or showing the cameras.  He really is a good camera man and has some great footage of wild scenery.  I've watched all the shows from season 1 and enjoyed all of them, and I look forward to seeing the other seasons."
B007MS58AA I like watching les because he is alone, and has to carry his equipment. Is he aided by anyone else?  -- not sure. But at least he admits to not knowing all there is but shows you how to take a chance without injuring yourself"
B007MS58AA Les Stroud is one of the best if not the best of the survival instructors.HE films alone and is by himself in this series for7 days in the newest ones 10 days.He has really helpful advice and lives the life he portrays.Even  has his own knife brand with camillius and the only reason i bought a camellius is because he helped design and set the specs really is a great buy ( i suggest the artic)  S how is entertaining and informative.two thumbs up."
B007MS58AA Les does this this BY HIM SELF. There is no camera crew. He hauls around 50 lbs of photo gear besides survival in some tough situiations. Very entertaining and educational."
B007MS58AA Survivorman test his resolve in facing survival in the wilderness with little or no resources and while doing all the filming himself. Well filmed and edited keeping a viewers interest throughout the episode and very entertaining."
B007MXEJU0 What can I say? I like things from the I.D. channel but (honestly) -- even with the disclaimer -- this was far too raw for me.After 3 episodes, I must call it quits.Why?Because while I understand that the world can be a wicked place, I don't always want to know just how wicked/evil it is.Because sometimes (and for some people) the suffering of the innocent can haunt you...Because most times (if not always) there is simply NOTHING redemptive (or entertaining) about sexual sadists and the pleasure they gain from subjecting others to their sick and defiled mental and/or physical wanderings...This program (while informative) could not silence the voice inside my head that kept reminding me that it was not \"good\" for me. Nor could it help me not to think about the victims and their families.In addition (particularly in this first episode) it could not quiet the distress I felt in knowing that there are parents who, by their depraved actions, create a heart of depravity in their own children. (For longer than I care to remember, I will be reminded of what her father told her and did to her on the evening of her mother's death... Having suffered another horrendous end, only by the grace of God would it be possible for her to end up being someone other than who and what she became. When it's clear that the perpetrator is also the victim? Nothing entertaining about it. Only fills my heart with sorrow which I really don't need...)Finally it became too much for me to know that there are women who would be, could be, complicit in such acts. (Episode 3 - allowing your husband to rape his own child and you being a part of it -- what more can be said...)Don't get me wrong. I love forensic type programs but...This program is about the utter destruction that 2 depraved hearts (joined together) can bring about against the innocent for nothing other than their own pleasure. In it the worst of what can be found in a man and a woman is lived out. It's about fantasy's becoming real, hearts becoming hard, and consciences becoming seared.All in all, the \"realness\" of it all is too much for me.Just too much..."
B007MXEJU0 What makes this show stands out from others is it vividly shows how as a couple, criminals have more success or more motivation to commit crimes. They truly feed on each otherGenerally speaking, it is terrifying, disgusting but it is not suspenseful as other similar shows such as Nightmare Next Door because it reveals the murderers&#8217; identity in the first 10 minutes.Episode &#8220;The Perfect Couple&#8220;depicts Paul Bernado and Karla Homolka. It is horrifying, and repugnant to see the perpetrator escalate from raping to killing. It is shocking to see how incompetent the local police was. The searched the killer&#8217;s house for 71 days but they did find nothing did not find the tapes that linked him to the murders.Episode &#8220;Madness of Two&#8221; shows a retired couple, Derek and Nancy Hasom found brutally stabbed to death in their home. When the true identity of the killer and mastermind was revealed, it was shocking.In episode &#8220;Mother Knows Best&#8221;, David Kazdin&#8217;s body was found in a dumpster. I was extremely scared after finding out the victim was killed because he refused to take part in a crime even though he did not hang out with the bad guys. It was startling to see Sante Kimes and her son Kenny Kimes graduated from check frauds, and grand larceny, to murder.Episode &#8220;Our Little Secret&#8221; is very unsettling. Police prosecuted a nurse aid, Gwen Graham, for murdering multiple patients based on only the words of a pathological liar, Cathy Wood. There was no hard evidence!Episode &#8220;Hearts of Darkness&#8221; is the strangest and most brutal of this season. A teenager killed 2 people and committed other crimes with her husband.  I could never guess she was a murderer.In &#8220;Murder at Twilight&#8221;, a senior couples were killed people for small financial gain. The killer&#8217;s method used to cover his tracks is sophisticated to me.In &#8220;Death on the Sunset Strip&#8221;, two teenage runaways were found shot to death near a highway ramp. The story regards the killers was strange, and twisted. Nobody suspected the male killer at first. He&#8217;s intelligent, educated, and mild-manned on the outside."
B007MXEJU0 I love all these true crime series on Investigation Discovery!  It's amazing at the amount of evil people there are out there."
B007MXEJU0 This is the 1st time I've seen this seris and my jaw is on the ground.  In law school, they teach that conspiracies are worse than crimes committed by single actors.  There's a multiplier effect on the evil and efficiency and effectiveness.  This episode was painful to watch as the murders were so senseless and wicked.  I don't know why this case doesn't get that much attention when the killers are pure garbage just like the DC Snipers and the Atlanta Child Murderer.The couple commit many crimes and the show goes through each of them.  After awhile, it gets irritating.  This was different from a show like \"Forensic Files\" where some scientific truth is the key to getting the killer convicted.  Near the end, we learn a governor commuted the death sentence of the retarded female in the couple.  I think recently the Supreme Court may have ruled that the retarded can't face capital punishment, so this case may have been a forerunner of that.From the 1st minute of the show, I was ready to put these killers up under the jail.  No wonder \"wicked\" is in the title.  I don't know if this episode will make me avoid the series or become addicted to it."
B007MXEJU0 Love this show!! It opens your eyes to the sick things that people do and I think that it helps you to become more aware so that you are not a victim too!! You watch one and then you cant stop!! Great show!!"
B007N4BTEW We Love Lucy!  I've always loved Lucy, and now our little ones love her show, too!  What more can I say?"
B007N4BTEW Haven't seen ILL for years upon years. The show is no worse for the wear in spite of being 60+ years old."
B007N4BTEW Who doesn't Love Lucy? This show was and still is a funny show that the whole family can enjoy. The best of the best."
B007N4BTEW Lucy can always make you laugh at yourself as she does it so well. She is an amazing and wonderful gift to all of us!"
B007N4BTEW You would have to be comatose not to like the comedy of Lucy and Desi Arnaz.  I sure hope we are piping their comedy throughout the galaxy. It's a sure fire way to maintain cosmic harmony."
B007N4BTEW I have introduced I Love Lucy to my 11 year old granddaughter and she loves it. She laughs and it is so nice to be able to show her TV shows that have no inappropriate moments."
B007N4BTEW Here it is 50 years later, and this stuff is still funnier than almost anything on TV today. Just a fantastic collection of great laughs and fun. I love it!"
B007N4BTEW This was a great series to watch.  Lucy is so funny and entertaining.  The picture display was clear and I truly enjoyed this program.  Thank you."
B007N4BTEW Another classic from all time greats. Laughter is  so easy when watching Lucy and the gang do their thing. So  funny."
B007N4BTEW I have been a Lucy fan for many years. No matter how many times I see the episodes they make me laugh, always. She was a comic genius. Ricky, Ethyl and Fred characters perfectly casted. The writers for the I Love Lucy show were phenomenal. Both actors and writers still entertaining the world over 50 years later."
B007N4BTEW I Love Lucy is a timeless treasure.  It's what all sitcoms of today aspire to be. I can never get tired of enjoying the antics of the frowzy redhead and her friends."
B007N4BTEW The quality of streaming is great.Every episode is a classic. These episodes are so funny, and if you have watched them before, then you'll love to relive them again."
B007N4BTEW I Love Lucy is a classic! Absolutely timeless. The humor is well executed. The show is light hearted and delightful. i Definitely could do a 'i Love Lucy' marathon."
B007N4BTEW It is nice that Amazon has collected all the I Love Lucy episodes so that future generations can enjoy the genius that was Lucille Ball was.  My only complaint is that the shows are out of order, which takes a little away from the viewing experience, and might be confusing for someone who had never seen the show.  For instance, you will have a show with Lucy being pregnant after a show where Little Ricky is already born, etc. . .  As far as the shows themselves, they are classic gems that stand the test of time."
B007N4BTEW I love Lucy is great classic tv. Still makes me laugh no matter how many times I've seen the episodes!"
B007N4BTEW I truly love Lucy. It is the only show from those days that is still funny to people in general. It is what all the comedy shows steal from today."
B007N4BTEW Great humor. Always was a big fan. They don't make them like this any more. Glad to have the time with family."
B007N4BTEW It's great to watch real comedy.  A good comedy makes us relax and feel good about being alive.Theses old comedies were created by people who knew what makes a person laugh.If only modern producers could accomplish what the Lucy show got done."
B007N4BTEW &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; always has been and always will be an all time favorite.  She and Ricky were true innovators of their time.  Still hilarious after all these years."
B007N4BTEW after all these years and even after watching the shows over and over... Lucy and crew are still the funniest!!!"
B007N4BTEW This is the set up for one fantastic television show. As you progress through the series you will notice how the 4 characters, Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel, mesh together and it is truly superb acting. Watch every show of every season."
B007N4BTEW I doubt if anybody could give this historical sit com anything but 5 stars.  We all grew up with Lucy and my children watch Lucy and now my grandchildren are watching Lucy.  A day hardly goes by without a Lucy line for the day.  This is an American Icon."
B007N4BTEW One of the best memories of my childhood is getting to watch this show! It hasn't lost its' charm although those days are quite distant now."
B007N4BTEW I Love Lucy never gets old. I have been seeing episodes since I was a kid and even today they do make you laugh. The HD version is digitized superbly and while the aspect ratio is 4:3 the black & white nostalgic comedy in this series can entertain anyone who has love for Lucy. Five Stars!"
B007N4BTEW It doesn't get any better than this. Funny, original, clean humor. The chemistry worked with real life married couple Ricky and Lucy. Wish all of the seasons were available for Amazon prime, and NOT just the two best of volumes :-("
B007N4BTEW My WHOLE family loves this show. My husband & I get to relive childhood memories of watching this show with our parents, and we get to create new ones with our children. Our 13 yo son laughs hysterically and really enjoys the time we spend together watching. WE Love Lucy!!"
B007N4BTEW Love watching &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; with the family. It's a great way to unwind at the end of the day."
B007N4BTEW I really like this series. It is clean, clever, and funny. I am an I Love Lucy fan. This is more like a series than a best of."
B007N4BTEW I love these shows ---&#62; that were done over 60 years ago is mind blowing for me. A dear friend, daughter of old Hollywood 'royalty', took an acting class with her many years ago and she was dumb-struck to work with her in person. She talks about it to this day."
B007NEZ1L4 Wasn't sure if they would like this one, but they do. It helps their cousins explain and have also gotten them hooked on this series!!!"
B007NEZ1L4 The idea of getting to see Ant-Man go to work with the Avengers, of course I love it! Well done!"
B007NEZ1L4 The Avengers is a solid and fun show.It can be enjoyed as an adult level cartoon or, depending on your tolerance for violence, for very young children.I am tickled pink that CPT America &#8211; he was in the Army so the abbreviation should be CPT &#8211; is back as a character that is all heart and no compromises. The troubled, angst ridden CPT America that I remembered from the comic books in the 70&#8217;s was just wrong.The way the series pulls in other Marvel characters, Iron Fist, Powerman, and Spiderman, is pretty neat as well.The one thing that disturbs me about the whole Avengers/Shield interaction is the new Nick Fury.  I remember SGT Nick Fury and his howling Commandos. I remember LTC Nick Fury Agent of Shield.  Since when did every army guy have to be a four star General or Medal of Honor winner to get the leading part in an animated story or Marvel movie?"
B007NEZ1L4 This is one of the best adaptations of the marvel universe I've seen since the old spider man and x-men shows of the 90's. This is just like this accept its more 21st century, its faster paced, there's so many villains because of the shear ammount of marvel lore that its can be daunting to keep track of whos whos. everything I've said so far makes a show absolutly spectactular because god forbid it makes you use your brain.At ant rate This is tottally worth the price and also you can catch the first season for free on netflx but then support amazon and buy the second season."
B007NEZ1L4 I will admit, I love this show!  I originally found it because my 3 year old son has somehow become obsessed to the 9th degree with Ironman.  I'm talking, he says Ironman probably, easily, 30 times a day.  Ironman is my brother, Ironman is big, I want big Ironman, I want Ironman's friends, I am Ironman...etc etc..all day, all week, all month.  Anyway, since he's too young for the movies, and he doesn't like the newer cartoon with the Ironman teen, I found this and it did not disappoint!  It's done well, like a real drama for adults.  There are the rest of the Avengers, crazy back stories threaded in.  It's so freakin good.  I literally sit in suspense as I watch.  My husband calls me to come to dinner and we (the kids and I) literally ignore him and keep watching.  So, I recommend you watch and get ready to be entertained.  I admit I've always liked superheroes but I never got into the Avengers; more of a Batman, Spider-Man, and Hulk tv series girl.  So now I'm into them, thanks to this show and my adorable boy who loves Ironman!"
B007NEZ1L4 Without wishing to raise the specter of ancient Marvel/DC rivalries, it's impossible not to compare this series withJustice League, and with Justice League's successor series,Justice League Unlimited. For although The Avengers doesn't quite have the philosophical depth of Justice League Unlimited, like the Justice League shows it is nevertheless proof positive that a superhero cartoon can be done entirely seriously and - astonishing as this might be for some people - still wind up as an intelligent piece of television. Far more so in fact than most live action \"grown up\" shows that get made.There is so much to say here, but of course, I don't want to give away any spoilers. One thing I will say is that I particularly love the languid pace at which the broader, season-spanning plot arcs are slowly, almost casually moved into place, even as the audience is blitzkrieged with the superheroic action sequences of the moment. For like Justice League Unlimited, this show is as much a serial as it is a series.So keep your eyes open as you go along!But for me, the best thing about The Avengers is the truly seamless melding of silver and iron age aesthetics. Old-school fans will delight in all the countless references to the original Avengers comic books from the 1960s. This applies on virtually every conceivable level, from costume design to inter-character conflicts. At the same time, we also see at least the beginnings of a far harder-edged iron age cynicism, and even political consciousness - particularly in the characters of Tony Stark, and, arguably, Henry Pym. Neither of these elements were ever even remotely present in the original comics. Contemporary comic book fans will likewise note the merging of elements from both the original and \"Ultimate\" Marvel Universes. Yet here again, these disparate elements are so perfectly combined that it is difficult to imagine them ever being apart.It's also worth adding that on a purely visual level, the \"cover\" art we see in the product snapshot here on Amazon doesn't really do this show justice. The art in The Avengers actually has a very slightly \"gritty\" feel to it that I haven't seen in an animated television show before; at least, not outside of some of the older MTV stuff from the 1990s.Finally, returning to the show itself, there is a lot here to tickle the interest of the more knowledgeable animation and sci-fi fans. For example, Jeffrey Combs, who so superbly provided the voice for The Question in Justice League Unlimited, here voices the classic Hulk supervillain The Leader. Combs will also be familiar to many from his various roles in multiple Star Trek series (always in heavy alien makeup). For the movie buffs, Iron Man is voiced with a downright Robert Downey Jr. quality; albeit not by Mr. Downey himself.Ah well. We can but dream!Theo."
B007NYO4GM An interesting look at the forces of Nature and how they are constantly reshaping our planet. A well done documentary."
B007NYO4GM I've watched a few of these so far. Not sure I'll watch the rest. They're not bad, just uneven. The show on lightening was informative, but the blizzard episode was just lame. It should be titled &#34;Don't you people check the radar?&#34; The show covered people caught in blizzards. One guy decided to get away for a while in the Pacific Northwest, so he hops in the car and starts driving without adequate supplies or adequate clothing. Oh, and without checking the radar. So, he drives straight into the teeth of a HUGE blizzard and gets stuck. For 2 weeks. The moral of that story is to know what you're driving into and prepare for it before you leave the house. With all the mobile technology we have at our disposal these days..."
B007NYO4GM Talk about timely. Several episodes were so current that I just saw parts on today's news. Fantastic filming. Just spectacular"
B007NYO4GM I loved every minute of this program.  It was stunning and educational.  I wish there were more seasons available to watch.  You will not be disappointed!!"
B007NYO4GM 5 stars on this one my personal favorite is tornados super amazing to see mother nature destoy all then volcanoes i just dont feel bad for people who live by one and there house is burned up what did you expect but very good scenes of all of natures fury highly recommend"
B007NYO4GM Definitely an amazing. My 13 yro said this is just like school stuff. My 5 yro thought it was awesome. A show that was informing and interesting. Couldn't stop watching it."
B007NYO4GM While &#34;entertaining&#34; in their own right, these programs are full of knowledge and learning opportunities for all...  You guys keep putting the programs up, and I'll keep renewing my &#34;Prime&#34; membership!"
B007NYO4GM Just think.  This is history and seems it just gets worse as it goes along.  Filming it is going to pretty hard soon.  I sure enjoyed this footage.  We don't live in a fairy tale world."
B007NYO4GM Very entertaining and informative. My nephew loves this a lot. He remembers a lot of information from this. Worth watching."
B007NYOJXK Selecting cases that evolve, rather than simply get solved, builds tension and interest. Each case is built through its interrogations, exactly the way real cops have to deal with it."
B007NYOJXK The interrogation results are gob smacking!  Can one obtain a 'public defender' before being charged with a crime? I wonder if this is why so many people just start spilling their guts. Is it like hypnotism?"
B007NYOJXK real life presentation.  excellent quality which is usual for ID.  easy to follow cases and issues related to interrogation.  if you like detective stories etc. this is right up that alley."
B007NYOJXK Low grade film not very interesting to watch. Story does not build up. Other shows like 48 hours has better interviews."
B007NYOJXK Pretty good show. Highlights real interrogation techniques used by the police to get the information they need to solve crimes."
B007O2TG6Q I used to live in Indy briefly so a tiny connection. That aside to watch such a dedicated professional team at work is a learning experience. I didn't think I'd like such a reality program but it's done well. You never see disturbing pictures of the deceased. So for anyone interested in real detective or forensic work this is a good way to see it in action."
B007O2TG6Q Solid police reality show and was left wanting more. Very similar to what's out there, but without the hollywood music, lights and extras we've become used to seeing. Just raw cops doing what they do best."
B007O2TG6Q A young man breaks into an older man's home.  As punishment, the older man makes the younger man strip down butt-booty naked and walk home.  Unfortunately, the young man went home, put on some clothes, grabbed a gun, and returned to the older man's house and killed him.  It really makes you think about the power of humiliation.  On the one hand, it's logical that the older man thought this would make the youngster never break and enter again.  The older man was being kind by not calling the police and prosecuting.  But on the other, (sexual?) humiliation is so embarrassing that maybe it gives a person, especially an immature person, a killing rage.  There's a movie in which James Cromwell's character is stripped and then handcuffed to a light pole.  That was funny and shocking and fun.  However, this humiliation led to a Black dying, so it gives me pause as a bruthaman.  Since some folk are turned on by humiliation, even though they don't show the act, it may get you hot and bothered.  Moveover \"Friday,\" this is REALLY an example of life in the hood.  Some folk may want to re-read Macchiavelli (sp?) after seeing this."
B007O2TG6Q I like this show because of how real it is. you follow the detectives on each case from start to end. the city of Indianapolis has the most solved murder cases in the United States. I wouldn't recommend watching if you have a sensitive stomach."
B007O2TG6Q I pulled this off Amazon Prime and I had never seen the series and wanted to expose myself to new dramas.  The Shift is a realistic view of police work and procedures.  It reminds me a bit of 48 Hours but with more depth.  I like this series and wish I had seen it before.  It is well worth viewing.  For adults."
B007O2TG6Q this show is well down and informative, takes you to the crimescene and you see and hear the witnesses. well worth watching."
B007O2TG6Q This reality show has interesting insights into what detectives have to go through to solve their cases.  The reality is that it takes time, patience, perseverance, and determination.  I gave this show four stars instead of five because I found it a little too choppy for my preference but the reality of the situations and the people involved make it an interesting take on criminals and solving crime."
B007O2TG6Q Too much reality...did not watch but 10 minutes....not my kind of show. There is nothing more to say. Really, really."
B007O2TG6Q If you are a fan of true crime then this is a show for you. Follow real life Indianapolis detectives as they collect clues, eliminate suspects, interrogate criminals and ultimately charge them with murder!"
B007O2TG6Q It is a wonderful show I enjoy watching it, I look forward to more seasons I hope it happens soon."
B007O2TG6Q This show is simply the best.  My husband and I love the shift.  When we had cable and it was on ID a few years ago we'd watch all the time.  The soundtrack is perfect.  We love dancing in weird hip hop motions when the music starts up...oh, what a classic.  Seriously,  if I go down mysteriously, bring on Breedlove, Tudor, and Minka to solve it."
B007O2TG6Q Love murder drama, it's sad to see this is real. Really like the detectives, down to earth and pretty good at their job."
B007O2TG6Q Don't like real cop or drama shows. If you do you would like this because it shows how the cops handle a homiside."
B007O62JG6 Very cute.  Much shorter than I realized but worth the watch.  It is great for parents that want something short to settle the kids down before bed."
B007O62JG6 What can I say I am into animated movies and Disney has top the scale with this one.  The horse and the lizard without saying a word to each other was priceless.  Their faces was enough.  The princess marry her handsome dream man and live happy ever after.  It gives us hope that we too can live happy ever after with the right man or woman in our life.  God Bless Disney and you too Amazon for having it there for me to see.  Thank You. God Bless You.  Sincerely yours; Georgia from Yuma, AZ."
B007O62JG6 I'm so glad I ordered this. It's short, but hilarious and done in the same spirit as the full length movie. It's entertaining for both children and adults, which I feel is so important. If you are going to watch things with the kids as a family you do not want to it feel like you'd rather have a root canal. Cute and quick!"
B007O62JG6 I love Maximus in the movie Tangled!! This is a great way to get a &#34;Maximus Fix&#34; when you don't have time to watch the entire movie.  My boys and I will watch it when we need a laugh...."
B007O62JG6 Well done movie that entertains both children and adults.  Charming visuals, very artistic.  They made it even better than the original Rapunzel story.  My young niece enjoyed it as much as I did."
B007O62JG6 This was bought mainly for my oldest grand kid who saw it in the theaters, thought this was the whole movie, but is a short version of the original....sort of a continuation of the movie."

B007O62JG6 The only thing I didn't like was that it was too short. 7 minutes of fun for the whole family."
B007OKD3GC I am a sucker that wasted my money by going with the cover picture (the statue ofLiberty pounded by flaming meteors ). Cool picture..could be a good film....NOTSad ...very Sad...  and you will be very sad if you waste any of your qualitytime for this piece of turd.Watched 5 minutes...fowarded the rest...then straight for the Garbage...No regrets on the money that i lost...I think this Studio....is worse that Asylum....can you believe that....im startingtoo................."
B007OKD3GC This movie rates as my all-time worst movie ever made.  A third grader can make a more coherent and interesting movie.This movie is supposed to be about the end of the world, at 4:44am covering the last evening and morning.  To sum up the movie there is:-overly extended sex scene.  Willem Dafoe is gross.  It's not hot or sexy, but if you want a sex scene, don't drag it out... 30 seconds would have done rather than the 5-plus minutes of amateur shots.-painting.  Lady, we get it, you paint.. and your paintings suck.-walking.  Lots of walking for no purpose.  In one scene, a stationary camera filmed the actress walking from one end of the apartment to the other... for 30 seconds.  No cuts, just one long shot.-lots of tv clips of interviews... this is a good 1/3 of the movie and serves no point what-so-ever.-going out on the balcony and looking meaningfully at the McDonald's across the street.-being shocked, absolutely shocked that you watched a person climb over a 4th story railing and jump off the building to their death... and then Dafoe, a few seconds too late yells out like he wanted to help him.  You watched him climb over the railing and said nothing.  Are we supposed to believe you didn't know he was going to jump?-Visiting friends who are partying.  One of the won't do drugs because he wants clarity for the end... are we supposed to believe that.-THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF ANY DISCERNABLE SCRIPT AT ALL.  Everything was ad-libbed with a general idea of what to talk about.. and it shows.  At least reality TV is fun and more scripted than this disaster.-Some asian kid delivers chinese take-out a mere few hours before the end of the world... why?  Like anybody would actually be working?-The movie is one long ad for Skype.I wanted EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER AND PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FILM TO DIE.  Even the ending was messed up as it took about 5 minutes to pass 2 minutes of time.... and the end of the world is a fade to white.  You don't even get to see these horrid actors burn which would have been the only redeeming characteristic of this travesty impersonating a film.I am shocked Willem Dafoe is in this.  Him having made this makes him clearly not Willem Dafriend as the movie and his performance clearly show no respect for writers, cinematographers, filmmakers, directors, actors, the audience, the popcorn guy, not even the cockroach that eats your dropped popcorn.  They should pay you to watch this movie but even that is cruel and unusual punishment.Watched on Showtime as it comes with my cable package."
B007OKD3GC What would you do on the eve of the planet's destruction? That is the question posited by Abel Ferrara's \"4:44 Last Day On Earth.\" The answer, it would seem, is to live it much like any other. I'm a fan of Ferrara as a filmmaker, I find him refreshingly unpredictable. I'm not sure, however, that \"4:44 Last Day On Earth\" conveyed and/or made the most of its intriguing premise. While I appreciate that not every apocalyptic endeavor has to be big, bold, and melodramatic--at times this felt so underplayed as to be virtually non-existent. While the concept and images advertising the movie may make it seem like a thriller (the word suspenseful is used in the description), this is a slow burn contemplation in which not much happens. Luckily, Ferrera had the wherewithal to cast Willem Dafoe as his central protagonist. Dafoe, as usual, makes for interesting viewing. This seems like an incredibly personal work for Ferrera and the intimacy that Dafoe brings to his performance is never less than fascinating.The inconvenient truth of the situation is that Al Gore and his contemporaries were correct about their dire environmental predictions. Catastrophe, however, is way ahead of schedule and the end of the world has been pinpointed with precision. How? Don't ask. Despite the fact that it is supposedly the last day on earth (not everyone believes it, even though news broadcasts have ended due to the imminent game changer), nothing seems too drastically different in Dafoe's neighborhood. Traffic and pedestrians seem normal, stores and bars are open, you can order Chinese food. There is never a real sense of doom. Most of the movie is spent in one apartment with Dafoe and his girlfriend (Shanyn Leigh) dancing, using Skype, painting, making love, or just hanging out independently. Ferrera's point, perhaps, is that life goes on even if there isn't much of it left. While an interesting notion from an intellectual perspective, it doesn't necessarily make riveting entertainment.I do give \"4:44 Last Day On Earth\" a marginal recommendation (mostly for the performances) for the arthouse crowd, I'm not sure the film will have a universal appeal. At a mere 82 minutes, I kept wishing 4:44 in the morning would arrive sooner. The film has a pleasing grittiness and rawness, and I appreciated the use of actual news footage (constantly playing in the background) to make the apocalypse seem tangible. Once again, don't think this is a thriller! It is a stagnant character piece with minimal dialogue. I'm not sure what I'd do on my last night on earth, I can only hope it would be more interesting than what is presented here. Ferrera's vision is filled with shopping, Chinese take-out, and karaoke. An interesting approach, to be sure, but not as compelling as I hoped. Watched it with a friend, he bailed at the 30 minute mark. KGHarris, 7/12."
B007OKD3GC I am very open minded when it comes to movies in general and indie films.  And I am a huge Willam Dafoe fan as he is a great actor, but this movie was a tragic waste of time, space and MONEY.  I can't believe I paid $6.99 to watch this terrible movie!  The script was terrible, character development poor, acting okay and there were NO special effects for an end of war movie.  Throughout this film, I could not help that this was a political (global warming, save the planet) infomercial.That said, save your time and money on this one...not worth watching!"
B007OKD3GC A newscaster telling people to just be with their loved ones because it was all going to end - the scene is rather haunting in its own right. There is a sense of despair and giving up as everything is gone. That's a great moment but it's unearned. It's unearned because it is coming in the middle of a movie full of these non-action moments that are supposed to be haunting and mysterious but ultimately just prove dull and uninspired. Whether Willem Dafoe is going on the roof and yelling at people or they are ordering Chinese food, nothing is really happening in this things.If these moments were part of 
B007ORTYKO This is a tough drama with many twists of fate. It has a driving sense of &#34;what will happen this time&#34;.  Not the best view to end the evening."
B007ORTYKO This was a fabulous serious and I was glad to have come accross it.  It was exciting riviting and kept me wanting more.  Why don't they make those kinds of shows, always!"
B007ORTYKO It's a pretty good show. It shows all aspecs of a murder from a torn family to the detectives trying to solve the case."
B007ORTYKO This series was GREAT. The Best I have seen in a long time. When I watched one episode, I couldn't wait to catch the next one. It kept me guessing the whole time, trying to figure out who was the killer. I wish there were more like the Killing.I loved it, and really hated to see it finish."
B007ORTYKO First & Second season were good. Reaslistic in many ways.I'll give a ONE  star to the third season. BAD!"
B007ORTYKO Season 2 of The Killing continues similarly to the first.  At this point, I very much like the relationship between the two detectives."
B007ORTYKO At first I thought the creators were taking a really predictable way out of solving this crime.  However, that was a red herring and the ultimate resolution is very satisfying regarding the unveiling of the killer. It holds together quite nicely.  I've seen both seasons of the Danish series and it is NOT the same person in the American show as in the original Danish version.I think the Danish one wanted to focus on a big problem in Europe today, Muslim immigration into European countries and the clash between the peoples thereafter. The American one goes an entirely different route and focuses on the desires of the human heart as the core issue at the center of the killing. Although we too have Muslim immigration, because we are so much vaster as a country, it has not produced the powder keg it has in Europe and so it would have fallen flat with American viewers.I don't know what AMC is going to do with this show.  If it is to have a third season, it is going to have to write it from the ground up.  Sara and Holder can be kept as characters, of course, but the Larsen family has moved on now that their tragedy is resolved. I hope AMC is up to the task. Although there was a second season of the Danish original, the new murder it involved fell oddly flat so I hope they write their own season three instead."
B007ORTYKO This series continues to be intriguing. A glimpse into the personal hells of characters circled within the ripples of a young woman's murder. Just when things become obvious the focus eclipses. Layers peel back upon layers. We have to forgive our heroes their sins. We have to rethink our conclusions. Everyone is breaking the rules a little. And the rules are breaking everyone. You find it slow? I find it intense!!!"
B007ORTYKO The Killing was a GREAT show on AMC - it has just been canceled and only lasted 2 seasons.  Does not end on a note that devastates the viewer, you will get closure.  Very entertaining and good twists."
B007ORTYKO I recently saw Billy Campbell on a morning talk show speaking about this program.  I am a fan of Billy Campbell so decided to check it out.  Just last week, I purchased the first episode of Season one and ended up getting the whole season...now on to season two.  I just can't wait to see the next episodes.  I'm addicted.  Can't wait now for Season three."
B007ORTYKO I came across THE KILLING on Netflix. I was so into this show, it was a MUST for me to \" catch-up \" with the series. I was extremely happy to find I could purchase ( watch ) season 2 via Amazon.com. Amazon.com is now my \" go to \" for watching programing previously missed. As for THE KILLING...if you've not seen it, I highly recommend going to Amazon.com and very economically watching it.Not only is the writing some of the best I've ever seen, the ( lead ) actors are amazing. I've since found other work they've done."
B007ORTYKO Revelations from season one into season 2 could have not been done better. Takes a lot to keep me guessing but The Killing nails it. Unfortunately there are too many people needing instant gratification so AMC is not renewing a 3rd Season. So with that said my parting words are \" IDIOTS at AMC you have disappointed a lot of fans\"....................update: YEAH!!! The Killing was picked up for Season 3!!! AMC listened to the fans :)Season 3 starts tonight 02June2013"
B007ORTYKO I love this show and get deeply immersed in every episode, but this particular one was outstanding. I cannot believe there are only 2 episodes left. Please, AMC, continue the series!!"
B007ORTYKO Never a dull moment and lots of twists and turns to keep most viewers on the edge of their seats.  Cannot wait for the next season.  Writing and acting is very good."
B007ORTYKO While a somewhat far-fetched, it's amazing to get 2 seasons out of the same murder. Lots of twists and turns, surprises and drama. Well acted and good storyline."
B007ORTYKO Very dark, heavy rain in almost every scene.  Loved the show but the ending a bit far fetched.  Seemed too many red herrings.However, well worth viewing!"
B007ORTYKO The Killing ended after this second season. That was the worst part about this series. My husband and I watched the first season on Netflix's but they did not have the second season so we purchased it from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for allowing us to know how this story ended and exactly who the killer was or killer(s) were."
B007ORTYKO Not your normal police drama and is generally what I would call a 'Dark Movie', somber in tone.  Not sure where the writers are taking the TV show as they are into Season Two, working on the same murder where the lead officer has actually lost her badge and is still investigating.  Not too realistic."
B007ORTYKO Even though the case was dragged out for 2 full seasons, it still packed a whollup in the end! You knew who might have been involved but I never thought that the aide was the actual killer!!!"
B007ORTYKO ok this episode starts out kinda slow...but then OMG!!! the secrets the Larson family  keep slowly start to come out! i love this show and each episode is better than the last!"
B007ORTYKO The season was better than the first, little less brooding, little less character development, but way more story. And the case is resolved, and for those who didn't know. This is it, as the show wasn't picked up for a third story."
B007ORTYKO This is a great show!  The characters are memorable though low key.  The story is greatand keeps you wanting to see the next one."
B007ORTYKO Each episode gets us closer to the answer (most of the time) but the mystery is unraveling faster and faster."
B007ORTYKO Excellent and suspenseful entertainment! I have enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2 and look forward to Season 3. Even my wife likes it!"
B007ORTYKO For those of you that stayed with the show through Season 1 your reward comes in Season 2.  Go ahead and buy the whole season because it doesn't conclude until the very last show.  It's worth it.  I don't know how.  A ginger in the lead and a partner who epitomizes a meth-head should not have a great cop show by any formula I can understand!!  It was so worth it to buy both seasons!  Enjoy.  You will not figure it out until the end."
B007ORTYKO As I posted in my previous review of Season 1, we loved this series.  The fact that the story line goes through two series and keeps your undivided attention is amazing.  Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman are great!  We highly recommend this series."
B007ORTYKO I loved this show with such a dark theme. I kept thinking I knew who the killer was a I was so wrong. Great actors, great show"
B007ORTYKO Like season one and two so much, had to buy season three.  was well worth it, especially if you like murder mysteries  :)"
B007ORTYKO REALLY  KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES WONDERING WHATS COMING NEXT, REALLY ENJOY THIS PROGRAM"
B007ORTYKO Great season ending.  Lots of action throughout the episodes and really moved faster along the plot than season 1.  Good character acting by all."
B007ORTYKO NO SPOILERS:First and foremost, while AMC officially canceled on 7/27/12, there is talk that Direct TV or Netflix are in discussions to revive.I said it before in my Season 1 Review, this is a \"dark\" series.  Yes, there is resolution, but with resolution there are no winners:1.) A family mourns a daughter2.) A wife copes by leaving her family, committing an infidelity and by virtue of leaving sister behind to take care of things, pushes her husband and sister together3.) A husband reverts back to a violent past that he thought he left behind4.) The Lead Detective becomes so obsessed that she not only is compelled to send her son to live with his father, but also loses her fianc&eacute; and begins to lose her sanity5.) A partner is beaten so badly that he almost dies6.) A honest politician and a good man becomes a cripple and jadedWhen resolution is finally given, it only causes additional pain!This was not a \"feel good\" series that makes you all happy inside once the mystery is solved.  However, there are plenty of twists and sometimes we all need to see a \"train wreck\" (metaphorically speaking), so we can feel better about our own lives."
B007ORTYKO Totally loved this series.  Tense, compelling and well crafted.  I want more and will watch for these actors in other venues."
B007ORTYKO The Killing is definitely a cut above the rest. Excellent writing and performances make for a very satisfying tale. I look forward to season 3."
B007ORTYKO We like it here, but we're the kind that like just the story line, and not all the personal drama. Which we could care less about. More shows should keep the law and order theme. Just the crime show and don't go sticking their personal lives in it.Thank you"
B007ORTYKO This storyline kept me interested from the very beginning, I love the relationship between the two detectives and their strengths and weaknesses complement each other.  The background of rainy Seattle, depressing at first, perfectly offsets the grim storyline.  The mystery, as with the first, kept me involved til the very end.  Can't wait for a 4th season and didn't even mind paying for Season 2.  Great acting as well!"
B007ORTYKO When Season One of \"The Killing\" premiered on AMC, it was an instant critical darling. An adaptation of a successful Danish television series, it was an intense and quiet show with a slow build drama that got under your skin. Those eager for easy answers and constant action might have needed to look elsewhere because the pace of \"The Killing\" was more akin to the unraveling of a fine novel than to that of a breakneck thriller. In the premiere episode, a young girl named Rosie Larsen was found murdered. Each episode represented one day following three distinct story threads. We saw the investigation progress, we examined the painful aftermath on the girl's family and friends, and we reflected on how the murder might be tied to local politicians and bigwigs. But despite its critical praise, which included six EMMY nominations (including Lead Actress Mireille Enos and Supporting Actress Michelle Forbes), the first season ended on a note of controversy. Fans felt betrayed that all of the answers into the mystery were not revealed and their vitriol was quite vocal! (Strangely enough, the show was canceled and then uncanceled and Season Three is currently on TV).Season Two, consisting of another 13 episodes, picks up directly where the first season concluded. Enos and her partner (an invaluable Joel Kinnaman) are now at odds after the season finale revelations. If anything, though, she is even more obsessed with finding the truth. As she doggedly pursues the investigation, it alienates her further from the department. Mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) is facing a new set of obstacles, also due to the events of last season. Seemingly out of the race, he will prove that he still has the stuff to be a major political player in the city. And the Larsen clan is in tatters, with mother (Forbes) on a spiritual sojourn and father (Brent Sexton) left to hold the family together. The three plot strands will weave in and out of one another as Enos follows the leads. Was Rosie a call girl? Is her death related to the suspicious activities of a local Indian casino? Was there a political motivation for her demise? Or was it something closer to home? This time, all will be revealed.\"The Killing\" continues to take its time, and the case takes a number of false turns before arriving at its final destination. There certainly are a lot of nefarious and unscrupulous characters in the Seattle area! Truthfully, I don't disagree that two seasons for this one case seemed to stretch the limits of what was necessary. But there are some tense and memorable moments throughout these episodes. I'm glad I stuck around for Season Two. In addition to smart scripts, the cast is absolutely first rate. Enos is fortitude personified, Kinnaman gives a star-making performance, Campbell is surprisingly strong, and Sexton is a powerhouse. I also liked that supporting players Kristin Lehman and Eric Ladin (as Campbell's staff) really come into their own. Perhaps the show's most unorthodox choice, however, is with Forbes. Continuing to explore the stages of grief, this tremendous performance is sidelined from the rest of the principle cast for most of the season. It's a bold choice, but I could watch Forbes all day! \"The Killing\" is an adult entertainment that requires patience and rewards it. If you enjoyed the first season despite its inconclusiveness, I really recommend Season Two. KGHarris, 3/13."
B007ORTYKO We really enjoy this show. We really love the character of Stephen Holder. We had never seen the actors who play detective Sarah Linden and detective Holder but they prove to very good actors. The show kept us at the edge of our seat and wanting more so we would watch 3 or 4 episodes at a time! Our favorite season is season three."
B007ORTYKO I am disappointed, once again, an excellent show with to notch acting is cancelled. We have more than enough 'realty' shows and not enough for those of us that want some form of entertainment that displays the abilities of actors rather than people making fools of themselves."
B007ORTYKO My husband and I have been riveted to the Killing. It's basically a whodunit, but very well done. Great atmospherics of Seattle, dark & rainy. Great performances, and wonderful chemistry between the two stars. Billy Campbell is a great new find.Highly recommended. Not HBO, therefore no gratuitous nudity, thank God. Just good old evil. :-)"
B007ORTYKO This is a very good crime drama.  However you do need to see every episode from season one to keep up with the whole plot.of season two.  Each episode is a day of the investigation into a murder of a young woman that took place during season one.  The show has a lot of twist and turns until you finally find out WHO DID IT."
B007ORTYKO The central characters of Holder and Sarah are very well done - they have flaws and addiction issues that feed well into the seedy world they are investigating. It's good that the plots are more intricate and as a viewer, you are required to think. Top notch TV, well worth seeing -- after you watch season 1, of course!!!"
B007ORTYKO What a great series.  This is one that sticks with you for a long time.  Great acting with plenty of twists to keep you guessing.  The political plot developed and then joined the murder plot.  I recommend it."
B007ORTYKO I bought Season 1 and got my husband hooked.  He finished Season 1 with a WOW I could hear two rooms away! Since,  he's watched 2, and sometime 3  segments.  We're ready to finish the series and cannot wait or the release of Season 3.  I cannot say enough about the quality of the acting; ALL the cast does their job and with superior craft.  WELL DONE!"
B007ORTYKO I found this show quite by accident and quickly became caught up in the storyline.  I am so glad to hear there will be more seasons!"
B007ORTYKO Just as good if not better than the first season!!!  Love how the second season is a continuation of the first season....same case...short amount of time has gone by. This show just gets better and better!!!"
B007ORTYKO Excellent Story line - Excellent writing - And EXCELLENT acting. Came across the series by accident while searching for another. Best find I ever had."
B007ORTYKO Unrelenting rain and gloom gets hard to take but, the ACTING is great and the PLOTS are tight.A lot of characters to keep track of over time.  A very good episodic mystery.."
B007ORTYKO I hate paying for streaming since I already subscribe to Hulu and Netflix....but...after getting totally hooked on Season 1 on Netflix, I couldn't wait for season 2, so I am working my way through Amazon's stream. I am not as engaged as I was, but I still can't stop watching. I am on episode 7, so far."
B007ORTYKO The sub-plots make this series worth the time.  Character development was better than average.  Got a bit draggy in the last season, but I still enjoyed it."
B007ORTYKO I don't think I have ever watched a series with more twists and turns as The Killing. I absolutely loved the ride. Just when you think you have it all figured out, it twists again. The characters are believable. It was exciting, sad, surprising and habit forming. I couldn't stop watching. Looking forward to the next season!"
B007ORTYKO I very much enjoyed this series.  I enjoyed the female lead.  A no nonsense sort of woman.  Very intelligent portrayal."
B007ORTYKO Excellent.  Suspenseful with a great story lines and great  acting.  So sorry that the series ended. I hope that the series makes a return."
B007ORTYKO Who? What? Where? When? How on earth did I miss the twisted, mind bending show? Am looking forward to viewing Season 1 to better understand all the particulars."
B007ORTYKO After a great first season, this series delivered an impeccable second season. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the episodes, and once you reach the final solution everything makes sense and is neatly explained. I really enjoyed how the personal issue some of the characters were facing were brought into the story-line, such as the whole Sarah Linden situation and the impact the previous case had on her.If there is one small aspect to criticize it has to do with the dark and rainy scenes, which happen pretty much constantly. It did not bother me much, so that is why I did not take anything from the rating, but I can see how some people may be annoyed by it. You will have to have the right lighting conditions in the room when watching this series or you may miss part of what's going on in the dark and gloomy scenes.The performances by the main actors are certainly proficient, and they do get the job done. If you like surprises, you will not be disappointed by this season, I guarantee it. Not only you will be guessing most of the time, once you think you have figured it at all, you will probably get smacked in the face by another surprise, so stay on your toes and alert at all times!"
B007ORTYKO While I really enjoyed both seasons of \"The Killing,\" I believe the audio production is second rate as far as getting to the bottom of capturing Holder's nearly incomprehensible mumblings are concerned. I'm not hard of hearing and he is not nuanced--he just mumbles. It really distorts plot points in a series that has so many convoluted plot points already. I don't understand the production oversight here. All the other characters are pretty easy to understand, but Holder--a truly great character conceit-- is simply an annoyance. That said, I was impressed that they could stretch this story into two years, but there are some things that are just too contrived. But we live in a world of contrivances, so what do i know?"
B007ORTYKO Season 2 is a continuation of season 1 and has a good finale (no spoilers). It did seem to take a long time to get there and there are a lot of layers to this story, but all in all it was good. I like how you think you know who did it, but then maybe not. It really keeps you guessing."
B007ORTYKO Season 1 was outstanding, season 2 still has me wanting more. You have to watch this show if you enjoy investigative police shows."
B007ORTYKO I like the show and could easily marathon watch back to back episodes. It has a very dark style both in content, intensity, and color filter of the show itself. The twists and turns of the investigation sometimes felt like a rollercoaster you were ready to be done with already, but you had to keep watching to see where it was going next. They really string you along but, mostly enjoyable though."
B007ORTYKO The 2nd season definitely made up for the letdown at the end of the first season.  This season was great.  It was filled with corruption, drama, suspense, was very dark, and had a great twist at the end.  I certainly did not see that happening.  I still can&#8217;t believe ******* was involved (I won&#8217;t ruin it for you).  As it was in the first season, the acting was great, the storyline was captivating, and it kept you entertained all season.  If you like suspenseful shows, then you&#8217;ll love this one.T.S. CharlesAuthor of young adult book, &#34;Consumed.&#34;  Available on Amazon."
B007ORTYKO I rated this 3 stars!  I did this for two reasons.1. the plot was central compelling.2. the theme was integral to the plot.I did not give it a higher rating due to the side plots1. the two main characters became too much distracting to the plot.2. if I wanted to see how REAL the characters could be, I'd be a Jerry Springer fan!Enough said!  will not pay for more $%#@!  Too bad because the writer's and the actors were very compelling and good!  Especially since there are too many other shows that I do NOT have to put up with this altruistic BS.thank you!"
B007ORTYKO Absolutely fabulous! The last episode was full of twists, turns, and surprises! I hated to see the season come to a close."
B007ORTYKO This murder mystery was well worth my time even though it was a bit depressing at times.  The characters are multidimensional and its is almost impossible to figure out who the killer might be.  There are many surprises and twists along the way."
B007OV0UYY My girls are 10 and 6.  They watch what the 10 year old wants much of the time.  The content of iCarly may be a little mature for the 10 year old (I'm thinking a 12 year old target) and is mostly boring to the 6 year old, but I am seldom concerned with it and the fun portrayed is mostly slapstick and positive.  I am less troubled by this than many cartoons.  I must say, however, that TV shows like iCarly are enormously effective in setting behavior and family norms and that even my 10 year old is often confused into believing that the real world is &#34;like that&#34; ."
B007OV0UYY Not as funny, and Gibby as a grown-up is kinda sad.  Carly's older brother is not as cool this time around.  He just does the same ol' stuff.  Sad."
B007OV0UYY I chose this rating because, in just about every episode I can relate to the funny things that are happening on the show.  It definitely brings back wonderful memories of my childhood."
B007OV0UYY This show is unwatchable and horribly acted. It is also extremely boring and not funny in the slightest. Don't waste your money on this crap."
B007OV0UYY A goofy slapstick show that is funny as well as creative.  From the first episode to the last, if you want to laugh with the kids, you will enjoy this!"
B007OV0UYY iCarly is a nice show that went for a really nice run. It had a few stars in the show, such as The Plain White Tees, Kenan Thompson, Victoria Justice, Lucas Cruikshank, and Jack Black. The show was entertaining to many viewers. This teen sitcom will have you entertained throughout its 6 season spread of a show. You should just watch it and laugh along like most people in the country would."
B007OV0UYY This show still grabs my kids' attention after years of watching episode after episode. They can watch these episodes several times."
B007OV0UYY I understand that \"iCarly\" is a wildly popular television series, so because of my negative criticism of its quality I will probably wind up receiving a number of negative votes from customers. But, as we start, I just would like to politely ask you to please read my full review first before deciding whether or not my critique was unhelpful.When this program first started, albeit it did generate a few chuckles (and at one point it left me laughing hysterically), for the most part I was not highly amused by it, and seeing as this is usually my sense of humor, I was confused as to why I simply did not find most of this entertaining. But as the years have passed by, I realized exactly why I was not amused: because it can be so amazingly hokey that it is a wonder as to why it grew to be so popular.And I realize that hearing about it may SOUND funny, and hearing about a few comedic elements featured in the series make it seem interesting, but to provide you with an example of what \"iCarly\" truly is like, I would like to ask you to think back to a moment where you tried a new food for the first time that you figured you would fall in love with or assumed would taste delicious, based on the fact that it looked delicious or that many people had described it to you as such before. Then when you actually sampled the dish for the first time, you found it so disgusting and foul that you couldn't bear another spoonful of it, or, at first, you enjoyed it and kept going at it, but, little by little, you slowly and gradually started to realize how nasty it truly tasted and couldn't handle it anymore. Or, maybe you just wanted to like it so badly that you had actually managed to convince yourself that you did, when in fact you did not at all or barely did. That is what \"iCarly\" feels like.Right away, someone may not realize the cheesy qualities of a majority of the jokes featured in this series. But, if you watch a few episodes and really focus on the little bits and pieces of dialogue and their content, you will slowly start to realize how corny it really is. Not to mention that the titular character possesses a few Mary Suish qualities; she is pretty, sweet, \"funny\" (or so the program labels her as) and normally does what is right, albeit she is still prone to a few bratty moments. Not to mention that she is the object of multiple infatuations amongst boys and gets good grades, and she lives a teeny-bopper's dream life; raised by an eccentric (but annoyingly childish and dimwitted) older brother who is noteworthy for crafting the most idiotic art projects imaginable (a Christmas tree decorated with fake noses instead of ornaments, for example), grouchy, ill-tempered teachers who are so mean and furious and over-exaggerated that they can seem stupid at times, and so many over-the-top, unrealistic situation comedy storylines. There is constant shipping amongst characters (\"Team Edward\"/\"Team Jacob\"-type shipping) and the problem is that the main characters almost NEVER LOSE. I can remember at one point where they did, but that is just about it, unless you count the episodes where everyone loses but everything somehow manages to turn out sunshine and rainbows anyway. Carly always manages to come out on top at the end, never comically losing, really, of course everyone loves what she does and she always winds up winning, everything turns out right. I once heard a reviewer comment that the program serves as an escape for children from reality. Yeah, it does, for spoiled teeny-boppers who think that the world revolves around them. \"iCarly\" would not last a day if we were living in a world of children's television of higher quality, mark my words. A lot of times, it's so corny it sounds an awful like the deliberately-horrible attempts at making a cheesy situation comedy you may find people watching on other shows and being bored by. NICKELODEON IS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO THE DISNEY CHANNEL! EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!"
B007OV0UYY iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $28.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!"
B007OV0UYY As with Season 5, I think I like this more. You meet Chip....Chuck&#34;s kid brother....LOOKOUT SPENCER! Sam&#34;s mom is arrested in Las Vegas.....the gang is off to Vegas in a crazy situation to raise 2500.00 to bail her out. As I said, I like this show as time went on even more. The Final Episode was outstanding, they showed quick glimpses of all the best episodes. Salute to Nickolodeon for doing it right. I could watch iCarly over 'n over again and not get tired, or bored."
B007PKOKZY I really like the characters and the actors. It is a different, unconventional approach of the encounters of two people that are lost in life, philosophically speaking.THis movie cheered me up. Perfect for when you are in the mood for something mellow and uncomplicated."
B007PKOKZY Hey, this turned out to be a far sweeter and interesting movie than I expected it to be.  The actors brought some real depth to their roles...if given the chance in bigger productions, I think they will do well.However, it does take a bit of footage to get the premise set up...be patient and maintain course...you'll enjoy this one.  It is kind of like a box of inexpensive fancy chocolates;  they all appear boring on the outside, and many taste pretty bland--but once in a while, you'll get a creme-filled center that just BURSTS with flavor and richness.This is that kind of movie."
B007PKOKZY This was a wonderful movie.  It is really about two people who are just trying to survive, define their dreams, and live them.  The story is simply told, well acted, and spun just right!  Definitely one for the permanent collection."
B007PKOKZY Wow, great characters, story, acting, cinematography, and NO stereotypes. An excellent rom-com for the thinking viewer. Refreshing indie film. Made us feel good! Thanks Prime! Searched for rom-com 4 stars or better, this popped up near the top of the list. Never heard of it before, but we're telling our friends."
B007PKOKZY With an original story that has never been seen, this is a beautiful little love-story that needs to be seen by more people. Chris Messina and Jenna Fischer have fantastic chemistry. Check it out if you haven't seen it already."
B007PKOKZY I thought the makeup & costuming of the mechanical man was good.  Amazing he could stay still so long but the story line lacked zing.  The story was okay but I guess it moved too slowly for me."
B007PKOKZY It was a very interesting movie, different enough which held our attention and kept us focused on it.  Great acting.  I would highly recommend it."
B007PKOKZY A nicely done, sweet romance story.  This is nothing more than a gentle reminder of what really matters in life and what doesn't.  It's not a film for deep thinkers and the portrayal of the self-help expert makes him out to be even more nauseating than the real thing (amazing, but I swear it's true).  The performances are fine and if your wife/girlfriend can accept it at face value it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes.  If you're looking for great depth, complexity or tragedy, you won't find them here."
B007PKOKZY Not your ordinary movie.  It tells a story and portrays the difficulty of life for those who do not travel the traditional path of the 9 to 5 working life."
B007PKOKZY At times I thought that this movie was going to hit me over the head with the \"It only takes one person\" message, but the thing that made it worth watching were the characters. They were deep, clear, and eloquent. This movie is worth a watch."
B007PKOKZY I love Jenna Fischer and Chris Messina and altho the plot is thin and kind of off beat, I enjoyed the 90 minutes of a break. Jenna, you could have put a LOT more of yourself in this show, b
B007PKOKZY This isn't quite a rom-com because there really isn't much going on that is funny, but it's not really a drama. It's two people trying to work out their lives together.Here's the scoop. Tim (Chris Messina) is a street performer who's girl just took a hike. Janice (Jenna Fischer) just lost her job because she's not personable enough. So she's living with her sister and brother-in-law till she gets squared away. Her sister is pushing jer into a relationship with an obnoxious author (Topher Grace) of self help type books. Happenstance lands both Janice and Tim jobs at the local zoo where a relationship starts between them. Will they find themselves, love and happiness?This struck me as a shrewd exercise in casting. Chris Messina is always good and very easy in front of the camera. He doesn't disappoint here. But Too many of the other characters seemed to be here because of their success in other currently notable shows. Fischer from \"The Office.\" Rich Sommer from \"Madmen.\" Bob Odenkirk form \"Breaking Bad.\" It all seemed a bit too calculated. Anyway....this is all just okay. Fischer is supposed to be someone trying to find herself an her place in the world but the way she's written she comes off as being dull and dull witted. Her hidden talent (which was wedged in with a crowbar) comes out of the blue. And Messina, who you like as a person, seems to have no particular talent at all. His one saving grace is that he works to evolve his Giant Mechanical Man street character and does succeed at it. Too much of what happens in the film seems too pat. It were as though they needed to take a little of this and put it here and a little of that and put it there. One crucial scene, where things come to a head between Fischer and her sister was clunky. It was written, acted and directed poorly. I like Jenna Fischer. She's just a super doll, but I think we've seen everything she can do in \"The Office.\" She didn't have the gravity to pull it off.This is a decent enough watch. It won't change your life, but you like these people and root for them. That's a good enough reason to see it."
B007PKOKZY Slow... how slow? I had trouble staying awake. But DO STAY AWAKE -- once the introductions are out of the way -- and that takes a bit of time -- the movie is charming. The three-way relationship between Jenna Fischer, Chris Messina, and Messina's Mechanical Man (a new twist on a love triangle, no? Well, no, not really a love triangle but... well you'll see) is nicely developed and has a good story to tell.3 stars instead of 4 or more because the start was soooo slow. Enjoyed it nonetheless."
B007PKOKZY The Giant Mechanical Man is a good and pleasant movie without quite crossing the line into great cinema. It does, indeed, have a few of the cliche`s of romantic comedies but is not predictable. Good acting and direction bring an interesting script to the screen. It's warm and at times funny without many belly laughs. I didn't quite love it, but a sure liked it, really liked it, a whole lot."
B007PKOKZY With a solid comic ensemble including Jenna Fischer, Chris Messina, Topher Grace, and Malin Ackerman, I was prepared to be swept up in the contemporary romance of \"The Giant Mechanical Man.\" Fischer's charms are on evident display here, she nails the every woman quality that makes her so inherently likable. And Messina steps into a leading role with ease, even though his \"art form\" of dressing in silver paint as a stilted street performer never rings true. As I've seen dozens of these acts, Messina lacks the technical sharpness to be so smug in his skills and contribution to the art world. Of course, this being a thoughtful indie--these two attractive and winning actors represent the lonely and disconnected among us. \"The Giant Mechanical Man\" becomes, thus, a very familiar movie in both its themes and plotting. I even have a nickname for these films, I have truly seen them so many times (and more often than not, they are meaningful low-budget indies). This is what I call a Lonelyhearts films where people who are attractive, intelligent, and appealing somehow manage to live depressive lives yearning for a soul mate.A certain heavy handedness is apparent in the character introductions. Fischer is such a hard case, she gets berated and set-up by her overbearing sister (Ackerman, lacking any form of subtlety). One such hook-up is with Grace (in a terrible wig) as a creepy and unrealistic self-help guru whose bluster masks his own visible insecurities. And Messina is dumped by a girlfriend who doesn't understand his commitment to his art (never mind that he doesn't support her and goes out of his way to embarrass her at a work function). The two wander the city, dine alone, and stare purposefully into space while moody music plays. These are all the cues you need to realize that these thirtysomethings are deeply unhappy. As movie fate would have it, the two both search the newspaper help wanted ads (no computers in the city?) and get different, but instantaneous, jobs at the local zoo. They are, of course, drawn to one another. Fischer, by the way, is also fascinated by Messina's silver alter ego whom she has opened up to in a moment of vulnerability (she doesn't know it's him. Even when she goes to his mostly empty apartment, she must not notice the work table with all the makeup).As expected, there is nothing really keeping these two apart but the screenplay builds in some manufactured obstacles. There are moments of amusement, but things unfold at a very leisurely pace. What do you think is going to happen? Will these two get together? Are nights of depression a thing of the past? I won't spoil anything, but I suspect you already know the answers. But without digging too deeply, the movie ends just as it arrives at its most pivotal moment. As I said, I like both Messina and Fischer. I just wish that I hadn't felt like I'd seen this movie at least a dozen different times in the past. Watching indie films, you'd think every city-dweller is isolated and unhappy just looking for love to complete them. It's a stereotype that is becoming a bit tired (especially when cast with actors that would seem to have everything going for them). Bonus points, though, Fischer finds a small screaming toy figurine. I own the exact little figure! It comes from the aptly titled Horrified B-Movie Victims Set from Accoutrements. About 3 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 10/12."
B007PKOKZY Really touching film about two souls muddling through life and then they found each other.  Very sweet little film indie film."
B007PKOKZY I really enjoyed this film. It is a simple love story based on the mystery of life. My only issue was that it was a bit slow, so there were a few scenes I FF'd. If you are in the mood for a sweet love story I recommend it."
B007PKOKZY **Oops, forgot to mention that I am not liquidtusk, I am Mrs. Liquidtusk. I never write reviews, but liked this movie a lot, and just had to tell someone!**I really enjoyed this movie. I do not watch television (long story), so I rely on the internet (Amazon, Netflix,etc.) It was really nice to see a flick that didn't involve guns, drugs, having and/or losing a child,grown men acting totally foolish. It was refreshing, so to speak. Even though it did include girl meets boy, girl loses boy,yadda yadda.. I have not given the story away,BTW.Topher Grace plays a character that you love to hate. I am glad I watched it, and recommend it. Thanks for \"listening\". Have a great day!"
B007PKOKZY Here we are, the Oscars are over at last, everyone has their bests and worsts for 2013, but when I think about the movies that were real, human, touching, I would say: Blue Jasmine, Enough Said, and The Giant Mechanical Man."
B007PKOKZY Very appealing story of a man and woman who meet serendipitously and are drawn to on another by their likeness."
B007PKOKZY I really enjoyed the whole premise of this movie. I thought the actors did an excellent job. I loved the character development both of the main actors did with their characters. The story was well written and tight."
B007PKOKZY Finding people who appreciate you for who you are is what it's all about.  We really enjoyed watching these two quirky people who didn't fit into regular life molds, and who were lucky enough to stumble onto each other.  Very refreshing movie."
B007PKOKZY A few words about this overlooked nugget of a film that seems to have unwisely slipped everyone by.Written and Directed by LEE KIRK in 2012 - its original title was &#34;The Giant Mechanical Man&#34; - which was quickly followed by its less difficult but more commercially feasible name - &#34;Love In Detroit&#34;. To confuse matters even more - it appears to be only available to UK buyers as an import DVD or BLU RAY that goes under the name of &#34;Karlek I Detroit&#34; because it&#8217;s issued in SWEDEN.I&#8217;m sensing that the sellers of this lovely movie bottled out of the quirky original title and opted for the horrid and cheesy &#34;Love In Detroit&#34; instead - also elevating the prettier Malin Akerman to the top of the cover (the blond) when she really only has a back part in the story (the original poster only includes the two principal leads at a bar).Janice is a young slightly kooky temp (Jenna Fisher of the American TV series &#8220;The Office&#8221;) who can&#8217;t seem to hold down a job. One day on the train platform she spots a street mime artist that she somehow connects with. Tim is kind of hard not to miss - because he stands nearly ten feet tall and is painted head to toe in silver (Chris Messina of Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s &#8220;The Newsroom&#8221; &#8211; he plays the character Reese Lansing who is Jane Fonda&#8217;s son in the TV show). Tim doesn&#8217;t engage with passers-by (except maybe a TV crew who spot an interesting morning segment). Feeling low &#8211; she engages in conversation with the still silver giant whom of course doesn&#8217;t flinch a muscle in keeping with his street art. But Tim has noticed Janice&#8230;Tim&#8217;s pretty but ambitious girlfriend (Lucy Punch) has had enough of Tim&#8217;s art-for-the-people dreams &#8211; and leaves. Her brother is the same and gives poor Tim a pice of his mind (a fantastic speech by Bob Odenkirk &#8211; Let&#8217;s Call Saul in &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;). Tim now needs a job &#8211; so he gets one at a Zoo where he meets Janice. Without his make-up - they slowly and awkwardly edge towards each other (without her knowing of his alter ego). Thrown into the mix to tempt weak-kneed Janice is Topher Grace as a longhaired self-help book-selling twat. Will Janice be able to fend off her pushy sister&#8217;s interventions (Malin Akerman) in her hopeless love life? Will she stop dreaming of her teeth falling out? Will the two society misfits make it in a sometimes cold and meddlesome world?The Region 1 DVD is &#34;The Giant Mechanical Man&#34; with the Blue Sleeve. But the BLU RAY is DANISH and uses their version/artwork of &#34;Love In Detroit&#34; as its title - &#34;Karlek I Detroit&#34;. It has no region locking so will play on both B (UK and Europe) and A machines (USA). It's defaulted to 1:85 (16 x 9) Anamorphic which is FULL ASPECT - so there's no bars top or bottom. And more importantly - the picture quality is truly gorgeous &#8211; a beautifully filmed piece of work.Subtitles are English, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish. I also think the &#34;Love In Detroit&#34; BLU RAY sleeve that is pictured on the Net and Amazon is a mock up that never appeared - it doesn't exist except with &#34;Karlek I Detroit&#34; on the sleeve.A fabulous and genuinely touching film - &#8220;The Giant Mechanical Man&#8221; also uses locations in the presently much-maligned and bankrupt city of Detroit to amazing effect.Give this gem a chance &#8211; I liked it so much &#8211; I had to buy it. I find hopeful and lovely things are like that&#8230;"
B007PKOKZY 2012PG13: It only takes one person to make us feel special, and that's what this movie does. It makes you feel special for having watched it.Hopefully the struggling artists out there will be encouraged by this heartfelt story. The world would be a colorless & tasteless wasteland without art, and this flick reminds us of that fact. A nice love story that both guys and girls can relate to without feeling like a chick flick.

B007PKOKZY Two smart attractive people are at a transitional point in their lives.  They each take dead end jobs at a zoo to keep busy and bring in a little cash and...whaddaya know: romance blossoms with a couple of standard movie roadblocks that almost keep it from happening.  Women will like this one.  Men will see every plot twist coming a mile away."
B007PKOKZY This is a good movie. The title caught my eye and I had to see it. I was surprised, really enjoyed it!"
B007PKOKZY Sometimes people go through life just not fitting in, not knowing what they want, perhaps even not knowing who they are or how wonderful they are. Things just don't work.But - the right person can change everything.  Instantly bring out a really wonderful you... and you just bloom and things just start to work.  This is such a story.It's slow, low key - perhaps boring to many for about the first half.  The main characters are kind of mousey, quiet, odd personalities most people just won't \"get\" or be all that interested in.... but to watch what happens to them when they meet and start to get to know each other is pretty cool.  Like watching a flower grow from bud to full glorious bloom on one of those nature shows.I liked this movie, but it's not one I'd watch again or call my friends and say \"hey, you've got to watch this\" ... you have to be in the mood for something slow and a little odd that takes awhile to start coming together."
B007PKOKZY This is definitely a good and original film. The story has a nice message and the actors were all excellent in their roles."
B007PKOKZY Though predictable, this movie was adorably endearing.  I thought the acting was great, the story was unique and I really enjoyed the plot."
B007PKOKZY I enjoyed every minute of this film. Such great casting and beautiful performances. It is best movie I have seen this year."
B007PKOKZY So heartwarming and relatable. I really liked the artistry of this film. The acting is great.  I could really relate to Jenna's character, Janice."
B007PKOKZY I like small independent films and this one fits the bill. It's not \"great\" but I felt the time was well spent and it beats 90% of the \"relationship comedies\" on TV these days.Actress Jenna Fischer (form TV's \"The Office\") Executive Produced this film which stars her and actor Chris Messina.  As you'll see from other reviews posted here, it's the story of two people trying to find, not only their place in the world, but a person who will understand them. The title comes from Messina's character who paints his face with silver paint and acts as a moving \"stature\" on the streets of Detroit, MI. (I'll point out here that nowhere in the film are you given a clue as to what \"city\" the film takes place - until the final credits. Detroit does not have identifiable buildings like New York, Chicago, or San Francisco.).Both leads are excellent, in my opinion, but the rest of the cast overact as \"happy people\" in Director Lee Kirk's attempt to make Fischer and Messina's character seem more introverted. It seemed forced to me.The 96-minute film is worth your time if you like \"droll\" - though smart - characters.There is one bonus feature: A 3  minute interview with Fischer and writer Director Kirk, that reveals that during the four years from when Fischer optioned the script till the film was released, they began dating, got married to each other and had a child together.As I said, it's not great but well worth seeing on your home TV.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B007PKOKZY \"It only takes just one person to make you feel special and valid and like you belong in the world.\" Janice (Fischer) is having a hard time finding and keeping a job not to mention trying to figure out what to do with her life. Tim (Messina) is doing what he wants to do with his life but feels unappreciated and is not making money at it. Both giving up they take jobs working at the local zoo. They strike up a quick friendship and want to develop more, but there are obstacles standing in their way. This is the definition of a sweet movie. I have never been a big fan of the typical love story movies mainly because they are so unbelievable. The \"good guys\" are overly good and the \"bad guys\" are way to horrible. While this did have a little of that this one is way more realistic and I would call this a real-life love story. This is a very sweet movie and the type of date movie that both men and women will enjoy. Overall, one of the better independent love stories I have seen. I give it an A-."
B007PKOKZY This reminded me very much of a film a few years back with Hope Davis,Next Stop Wonderland, though I liked this one better, also the wonderfulMartywith Ernest Borgnine, another film that seems cut from the same cloth.  The best gifts seem to me to come in simple packages.  Jenna Fischer (The Office: Seasons 1 - 4) and Chris Messina (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) were both wonderful, plus the chemistry between them was POTENT.  Messina is SUCH a talented, compelling actor, I didn't even recognize him from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, went back to see what part he played in it, so different as to seem another person entirely, amazing.**SPOILER ALERT** I don't know about you, but I often have those days when I seem to be on a different wavelength from everyone else.  The two leads, Janice and Tim, have that experience too, indeed, it's the hallmark of their respective lives, Janice's especially.  She wants to come alive, mesh, but those around her seem to be living parts in a play, and somehow, she was never provided the script.  Tim feels at home in a circle of close friends, but yearns to awaken those \"sleepwalking\" in the world at large.The motivational speaker in the movie does a great job of demonstrating the inane, superficial patter that passes as conversation and meaningful interaction between people- SO busy with the trappings of social networking, and full of themselves, and yet, for them words seem to flow easily (how productively is less clear).The Giant Mechanical Man, on the other hand, seems to represent the opposite extreme- stuck, controlled from without, powerless, alienated from everything and everyone (by virtue of his height, metal exterior; rooted as a scarecrow, unable to speak or move fluidly).  I once worked with mechanical people/mimes, quite eerie, performance art, very affecting, and the movie uses that to great effect.  It takes just one honest, sincere person on the same wavelength to break through, someone who actually sees you.I've seen this several times now, like it better with each viewing.  One thing I like very much about it is that at its heart it's kind, understanding of others, not blaming of them.  Bosses who fire, landlords who evict, were not evil or cruel, but doing what they must, often regretfully.  Underlying everything is pathos, compassion for humanity, even the jerks.  I liked the human resources gal at the zoo- honest, caring, such a person can make a real difference in people's lives at work, and she did.  The film has great music, too.This movie is a bit slow moving, but I don't mind that, it built steadily to a satisfying resolution.  It's subtle, understated, simple, I like that.  For me, what could be better than alienation, being lost- and then- finding that special someone who brings you and everything else to life?  It reminds me of a line H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell) says in the movieTime After Time- \"Every age is the same, it's only love that makes ANY of them bearable.\"  The pivotal scene was perfect.  I loved this movie.  (P.S. The film continues through the credits, and the final scene FOLLOWS the credits, so stay tuned!)"

B007PKOL62 Sleepless Night came in under the radar and blew me away with its ultra realistic fight choreography. Our anti-hero Vincent fights like a real man would. He's sloppy, uses the environment to his advantage, and gases out too quick. The action is so intense that listening to the original French audio track and reading English subtitles became an afterthought. Sleepless Night is likeTaken, minus the hokey neocon propaganda and Xenophobic agenda."
B007PKOL62 Good acting for French films go.The movie moved along and kept you interested.Could have been filmed in more locations?D"
B007PKOL62 Believe it or not, SLEEPLESS NIGHT is the kind of flick I could (seriously) go on about forever about why I liked it ... but I'll try to keep it brief.  I've always been a fan of the real-time format put to so popular use on Fox TV's series 24 - starring Kiefer Sutherland - because the race-against-time format just naturally lends itself to quality storytelling when it's done right.  (24 was done expertly on most counts, though its final season really left a lot to be desired.)  There's just something I find endearing about racing to beat the clock against insurmountable odds, and SLEEPLESS NIGHT taps into that dynamic while at the same time turning the predictable police procedural on its head.Vincent (played by Tomer Sisley) and a fellow corrupt police officer pull off a major drug heist with one big mistake: they're identified by members of the mob trafficking the cocaine.  Mob boss Marciano (Serge Riaboukine) kidnaps Vincent's son, holding him in a local nightclub, and he gives Vincent until the end of the night to surrender the drugs or the boy will die.  However, other cops are hot on Vincent's tail, and, before the night is over, he'll be crossed and double-crossed in his attempt to deliver the drugs, right his name, and get out with his son alive.Now here's the trick(*** minor spoiler here so you've been warned but it is VERY minor ***), Vincent may or may not be an upstanding police officer - fortunately for us, the film never makes it perfectly clear - and that's part of the appeal of NIGHT: you don't know if you're rooting for the good guys or the bad guys here.  The story presents plausible plot points I won't divulge but, suffice it to say, it's entirely open for debate and/or interpretation.  Whatever the narrative thrust, it's still easy to get caught up in the action, which unfolds fairly consistently after the opening set piece puts all of the players in motion.  It's an effortless job, well-crafted by director Frederic Jardin, who'll hopefully find more work in the action genre in the years ahead.That point aside, SLEEPLESS NIGHT is just an all-out, no-holds-barred frenetic experience.  As mentioned, there's a modest amount of set-up - all of it handled with great conciseness with a script from director Jardin, Nicolas Saada, and Olivier Douyere - and, once that's out of the way, NIGHT becomes the kind of experience action fans want to immerse themselves inside.  The narrative pushes forward much in the same way a train thunders forward on the track, never stopping or slowing until the engineer pulls back on the throttle.  Secrets are revealed at a brilliant pace, and, once disclosed, they serve as set-up for the next action sequence.This isn't car chases, mainstream actors, or big pyrotechnics on display here.  This is guttural filmmaking.  NIGHT is a collection of hard-boiled gunplay and stone-cold fisticuffs.  Everyone here - and I do mean everyone - has an agenda, and that agenda is all that matters.  From the perceived good guys to the perceived bad guys, everyone is out for their own piece of the action, and it's this winning collision of circumstances that makes for fist-pumping excitement from start to finish.  Give NIGHT a chance, and I'm sure you'll be rewarded.  In fact, the only problem I can honestly say I had with the picture was its name: SLEEPLESS NIGHT.  I was tempted to pass this one up and spin something else in the player, but, after reading the synopsis and doing a bit of my own homework checking into a few reviews, I gave it a chance.  What can I say?  I'm glad I did.SLEEPNESS NIGHT is produced by Film Fund Luxembourg, Paul Thiltges Distributions, Canal+, Cine+, and a host of other companies.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  The DVD looks and sounds terrific.  Also, the film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival as well as serving as an \"Official Selection\" of the Tribeca Film Festival and Fantastic Fest.  The only special feature included on the disc (sadly, I might add) is an interview with the cast.  I would definitely have loved to see some special insights into the storytelling and the challenges of shooting so many fight scenes in some ridiculously tight places (of which there are many in the flick), as well as some commentary by the director detailing his camera trickery and shot-work.  It all looks nice and works so well, I hated for it all to end with no in-depth materials to speak of.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  SLEEPLESS NIGHT is a rare find, one I'd have no reservations about recommending to anyone, be they fans of action, thrillers, or foreign films.  It's a cinematic shot of adrenaline delivered right to the heart - one man's struggle to set the things right that he deliberately had a role in setting wrong - but this is a world where guilt or innocence isn't easily defined at the end of the gun, or the tip of a knife, or the kick to the head.  This is a world where one wrong move may cost you not only your life but also the lives of those you know and love, and thank God for one cop - good or bad - who wasn't going down without a fight.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of SLEEPLESS NIGHT for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B007PKOL62 Eh, it was ok. Nothing special about this movie. A waste of time and money on my part.Take it or leave it is what I say."
B007PKOL62 Vincent is a police officer, but is also involved with drug deals and the mob. His involvement with the mob gets more-and-more dangerous as he makes deliveries, pick-ups, and promises. After he gets into deep trouble from problems with the mob, his son is kidnapped. The clock ticks fast as time is not on his side, and his situation could be tragedy for him and his son. Action-Packed, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and thrilling from start to finish. Highly Recommended!"
B007PKOL62 There are few touching moments in this film.  But you have to wait to find them.  It's the waiting part that ruins the film.  What I remember most is that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities.  They were all weak, is some way or another."
B007PKOL62 The French thriller \"Sleepless Night\" is a movie that pulls no punches.  It doesn't have lofty goals or meaningful subtext and that's perfectly all right.  It aspires to entertain by being a mean and relentless excursion into action movie mayhem and it easily succeeds as one of the year's most exhilarating adventures.  By serving up a high octane thrill ride, \"Sleepless Night\" becomes (for me) one of the year's biggest surprises.  In case you can't tell, I really loved this down and dirty film!  From a plotting standpoint, you've certainly seen it all before.  There are good cops, bad cops, drug lords, and local gangsters all on the prowl for a cache of narcotics.  What makes the movie so enjoyably twisted, however, is that most of the action takes place in an immense nightclub on the outskirts of Paris.  The various parties collide or evade one another in congested parking lots, busy kitchens, labyrinthine back offices, rollicking dance floors, and bustling pool halls.  This is one hot club!  I want to go there NOW!The movie starts out on familiar territory.  A car chase and shoot-out results in the theft of a rather large bag of drugs.  All is not how it would seem, however, as the major players have conflicting alliances.  I won't divulge too much, part of the film's pleasure is how the revelations unfold as the action progresses.  In the midst of the set-up, we're introduced to a local police officer played by Tomer Sisley.  Sisley is in the middle of several rival factions, and his son is taken as a pawn to manipulate him.  This leads all the key players to the aforementioned nightclub and this is where all bets are off.  The pacing is fast, the scenarios are clever, and the staging is perfectly constructed.  While there are plenty of fisticuffs as well as countless shoot-outs, \"Sleepless Night\" always remains smarter and more intellectually stimulating than you might anticipate.  Let's just say that not everything will unfold as you expect it to.Credit must be given to filmmaker Frederic Jardin for making these common plot elements feel refreshingly original.  As the story progresses, I found myself laughing out loud as the stakes keep getting raised throughout.  Again, Jardin isn't attempting anything revolutionary here.  He wants to keep you entertained, and I had so much fun!  The pace never wavers and the narrative will keep you guessing until the final scenes.  Ultra-violent and absolutely relentless, \"Sleepless Night\" might not be for everyone.  But if you're looking for an action film off the beaten track, you won't find one more consistently and wildly involving.  Check it out, I suspect this has the potential to become a real sleeper hit on the DVD market and beyond.  KGHarris, 9/12."
B007PKOL62 Tomer Sisley is an amazingly intense actor! I just discovered he's a stand-up comedian, which I find a little hard to believe since he plays such serious, intense characters in both of the movies I've seen him in (this and The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch). I have no idea what kind of characters he's played in other films, though, since I haven't seen them. I just would never have guessed he was a comedian.This is a good movie, but if you don't like to read subtitles, then this might not be for you. Otherwise, if you're a fan of fast-paced, gritty (French) thrillers, then you should check this out. Tomer Sisley apparently likes to do his own stunts, and his character (Vincent) gets beat on quite a bit in this movie (I kept wondering how much more he could take, until he finally gets knocked out!), but it's not crazy, over-the-top violence a la Quentin Tarantino. It's \"normal\"...whatever that is! LOL! You know what I mean. There's some blood, but not too much. I mean, Vincent is a cop who's tangled up with bad cops and drug dealers, so of course there's going to be some violence...Anyway, if you're a fan of other French actors like Jean Reno, you might like this too.Enjoy!"
B007PKOL62 Before this fine French film gets Hollywoodized, as I'm sure it will, check out this lean action thriller.  Tomer Gazit Sisley plays Vincent, a cop who also does a little side business robbing mobsters of their drugs and reselling them to others.  During a heist on neighborhood streets, he is stabbed and identified by the local mobster, Marciano (Serge Riaboukine).Marciano abducts Vincent's 15 year old son, Thomas (Samy Seghir)and holds him for ransom.  The rest of the movie takes place in a suburban Paris nightclub run by Marciano.  It seems Vincent is also being watched by a pair of police internal affairs officers.  Vincent attempts to return the satchel of cocaine, but through a well-orchestrated series of events, it is misplaced.Beautifully directed by Frederic Jardin, this low-budget film is full of action, tension and hand-to-hand combat within the confines of the packed club.  There are a couple twists included to keep it all interesting, but in the end it's hard not to root for Vincent's relentless effort to rescue his son.  Terrific film."
B007PKOL62 This is non-stop, over the top in the underworld, pulls no punches but throws a lot of them, very violent, very sexy, very French, and very good."
B007PKOL62 To fully enjoy Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Jardin's \"Sleepless Night\" (\"Nuit blanche\"), perhaps you should not read the reviews including my own. All you have to know is that the taut French thriller is about a desperate father Vincent (intense Tomer Sisley), whose estranged son Thomas (Samy Seghir) is kidnapped. The story unfolds at a breakneck pace, showing how Vincent ends up in trouble in the opening fifteen minutes, where a car carrying  a bag full of cocaine is attacked.Honestly, there is nothing in the film that you have not seen before: drug heist, a club owner and kingpin, double-crossing and extended hand-to-hand combat sequences. Vincent's plan to take back his captive son goes wrong when a third party steps in. The strength of the film lies in the skills and confidence of the director, who will not give us time to dwell on how implausible the film's entire storyline is.Like another French thriller \"Pour elle\" (basis of Russell Crowe's \"The Next Three Days\"), \"Sleepless Night\" requires us to accept the premise that is intriguing but contrived, but it is hard to resist the well-told story of a father willing to do anything for his son. \"Sleepless Night\" is ten minutes too long, with a slightly drawn-out final act where things wrap up too neatly, but the film is a thrilling ride nonetheless."
B007PYEWZ8 This movie was boring.  There are some movies that brilliantly let the viewer experience violence, without the violence actually being seen, leaving the viewer to reconstruct the scene in his/her mind, and/or consider ambiguous plot details (who is the actual killer?).  Pulp Fiction comes to mind, at least insofar as most violence was just barely removed from the actual screen.  This film tries to recreate that approach, but it falls flat.  There has to be a strong plot connection for the actual violence/implied violence to have an impact, and that connection is lacking here.  In most scenes, we come to realize that someone has been killed, but rather than having a strong emotional impact, its a simply \"so what\" event.  The viewer is never brougth into the antagonist's or protagonist's emotional sphere, so you never really care. You never feel like the protagonist (Luke Wilson) is actually threatened, so everything else has no impact.  Further, Luke Wilson, while decent for low brow, college-level humor, is way out of his league playing this kind of role.  The movie is just flat and dull, not recommended."
B007PYEWZ8 While it's not quite \"Fargo,\" this is a suspenseful film in the same vein. A lot of comparisons have been made with \"Pulp Fiction,\" and I think \"Meeting Evil\" is at least as good as that one. Jackson shines as the seemingly invincible boogeyman--an African-American guy who whistles \"Dixie\"? Wilson makes a very convincing straight-man. Bibb as his wife is a fine character whose rant against an overly intrusive cop is truly memorable. Though they say little, their kids contribute a great deal with mere gestures and facial expressions. The surreal host of caricatures also notably includes a mysterious little neighborhood girl who flips off the cops. On that subject, \"Meeting Evil\" does an exquisite job of satirizing--perhaps \"burlesquing\" is more the word--law enforcement, the failing real estate market, and \"orderly\" society in general. Although the pacing is sometimes a bit slow and it could have gone a bit farther in certain thematic places, this film has all kinds of subtle little foreshadowings, hints, and nuances that make it, well, what it is."
B007PYEWZ8 Although not a totally creative storyline (something similar was done many years ago) it was creative enough to warrant 4 to 5 stars, especially with the intelligent dialogue and engaging performances by the actors. Overall the script was well done with a nihilistic setting of a singular, nearly foreclosed, suburban home in a purgatory suburban wasteland and nihilistic plot structure where morality seems to be guided by evil itself (hence, perhaps, the title). Well directed and the filming was so subtle that it was almost as if the camera didn't exist.The only weakness was how the movie ended. The writers didn't finish with courage which, incidentally, was one of the major morality themes in the movie. I thought it was just rushed and anticlimactic. It did not hold the creative tension and suspense that preceded it over the duration of the movie. More interesting endings might be:(1.) That the mysterious \"girl with dog\" either be an angel to dispatch the \"Evil Incarnate\" Richie (Samuel Jackson) or, alternatively,  as a \"Kick-Ass\" Chlo Moretz knock-off with a Glock under her coat. Or, maybe the dog was God's angel.(2.) The wife and family resolution seemed to be a safe, middle class friendly, whimper of an ending. The muddy pool and police seemed as if written for a different movie.  I would have scripted out the police and written a creatively appropriate \"teachable\" ending for both the wife and her husband. Something with a bit of nastiness to it.MIght have a bit of \"The Hitcher\" in it; not sure."
B007PYEWZ8 Should be called \"meeting boredom\", \"mistakes on a bane\", \"djang-doh\", \"brown snake moan\", or \"proxy brown\".  Ok I'll stop. I\"m saying this movie is poop and the world is less fun from having seen it.  I think it was made so that Luke and Sam could race lamborghinis off a cliff while high-fiving (lukes' from the uk)."
B007PYEWZ8 I watched this as a Prime customer for free.  It was worth about half of that.  Very similar to stepping in dogcrap.  Now I have to go bathe."
B007PYEWZ8 Fun thriller about a sad sack real estate agent (Luke Wilson) who runs afoul of a very scary man (Samuel L Jackson) who nearly runs him down on the street in front of his house and offers to take the injured man to the hospital emergency room.  Needless to say they never actually make it to the hospital.  At times this reminded me of The Hitcher (Rutger Hauer version), but with a lighter tone and significantly less sadism.  Samuel L Jackson hasn't been this good in anything in years--he's genuinely scary and engaged, which hasn't really been the case with much of anything he's appeared in since Pulp Fiction.  Even though Meeting Evil isn't always all that believable it is very entertaining."
B007PYEWZ8 Meeting Evil follows John (Luke Wilson), a struggling family man, as he is taken on a vicious trip by a stranger, Richie (Samuel L. Jackson). The film packs a fast-paced story with a twisted ending, but has some flaws.The story was interesting and often brutal; but, the audience usually doesn't see the actions of Richie, which slightly takes away from the thrills and tension. Samuel L. Jackson plays the sinister villain perfectly, and Luke Wilson does a decent job. I liked the exchanges/conversations between John and Richie, and really enjoyed the ending. However, I couldn't exactly place my finger on it, but something made the film feel amateurish or \"off the mark\"; it may have been the mixed flow of the story, the editing may have been off, or maybe it was the music which I felt really didn't match the tone of the film. This thrilling ride John goes through in the film simply didn't affect me as much as it should've, it just wasn't an immersive film.Overall, I liked Meeting Evil; Samuel L. Jackson's performance and the great ending definitely redeem the film. As of 12/1/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, I recommend streaming or renting before purchasing.Meeting Evil has strong blood and gore, no sex or nudity."
B007PYEWZ8 Why wait and pay more money at the theatre?  Another great Samuel L. Jackson flick!  Ends with a twist -- and a lingering question."
B007PYEWZ8 You may not have heard of this movie, but it is interesting and appalling and worth watching. Get some popcorn and rootbeer and make an afternoon of it."
B007PYEWZ8 This movie kept my husband & I on edge through the whole thing. Lots of death and blood. Love the actors and they did a great job with the story."
B007PYEWZ8 Luke Wilson stars as John Felton, a real estate agent who can't catch a break. The housing addition he works and lives in has fallen on bad times with the housing crunch. Unable to get a loan, fired from his job, he comes home to be surprised by his wife and children only to lash out at them. They leave to visit the park and a knock at the door finds John facing Richie (Samuel Jackson).It seems Richie's car won't start and he needs a push. John obliges and then Richie asks him to go with him so he can repay him with a drink. The bar they end up in is familiar to John and he begins to feel a bit uncomfortable when finds the boss who just fired him at the bar. John takes the high road and backs away gracefully but Richie just doesn't see the world that way. He suggests John take on a bit of revenge. John declines.Also in the bar is a young woman named Tammy that John worked with at the real estate agency. Not only did he work with her, it comes out that he was having an affair with her, the main reason that his boss fired him. When Tammy's too drunk to drive, he and Richie give her a lift. This is where things begin to change.For whatever reason Richie is evil personified in one man. Anyone who does something to John, for instance the cell phone store clerk who won't allow him to make a phone call, suddenly ends up beaten to death, of course, after a visit from Richie. The three roll down the highway until John thinks he sees Richie for what he really is when he slaughters everyone in a quick stop gas station.In a situation where he has to worry about the Tammy as well as himself, John can't simply drift off alone. When Richie shoots a truck driver who nearly runs them off the road it seems that their fate is sealed. A stop at a nearby house soon after gives John a chance to help Tammy escape but leaves him there with Richie as the police turn up. Richie kills the policeman as well and off they go down the road once more.The police are trying to track down the killer responsible for not only the gas station killings but the cell phone store clerk as well. When they question John's wife its clear that they think John is responsible. He was the last one seen in each spot and no clues concerning Richie are there.John eventually convinces Richie to let him go and he does without threatening him. He does remind John as he drives away that John had invited him to his home for dinner at some point and that he thinks now is the time as he pulls away.John is caught by the police, still the main suspect behind the killings. He knows that Richie is behind it all but how can he convince them? Not only that, can he do so in time to be released and make sure that his family is safe as well?The film has a nice twist during the final portion of the film, one that most won't see coming. Just who Richie is, why he's doing everything he's done and if he truly is nothing more than evil personified is revealed. In any event what we are presented with from start to finish is one of the most terrifying characters ever seen on screen. Jackson does a stand out job speaking calmly yet oozing menace with each word. His actions speak much more than his words but the words give you those chills.I was afraid at first that this film would be boring and take far too long to get going. I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. In a world where people are facing hard times, where everyone feels like someone some where has screwed them over, it's easy to relate to the character of John Felton. At the same time it's easy to see why he changes a bit before the end of the film."
B007PYEWZ8 Sometimes with Samuel L. Jackson you get him playing a hero or a villain and honestly he's good at both. He did a good job playing his character in this one as an evil eyed killer that murdered people \"just because\". His role in the film is one of the movies more redeeming qualities as I don't believe it would have worked so well with a different actor. These \"I met a stranger\" type of movies really require just the right person with the right bits of crazy. The only other movie I think that pulled it off nicely was \"Blood River\" but that's a whole different league.Meeting Evil is the story of a man who's down on his luck with his job,his life, and his marriage. Everything that can go wrong did go wrong for him. He's just a good guy trying to hold on to whatever positive he has left. What is unraveled in this movie is a much deeper personal look into John's problems. The first of which starts as soon as he foolishly tries to lend a helping hand to a stranger that knocks on his door. Samuel Jackson plays \"Richie\" a sadistic killer that's capable of doing anything and everything. John is at first very naive to all of this until he finally buts it all together for himself and finds himself caught in an even deeper mess than he ever imagined.What makes meeting evil good is that it brings up some interesting plot points and what makes it bad is that it never builds on them at all. It just sort of shows you one thing like Johns relationship with his female co-worker and then it never comes back to it. It's sort of just left there when for the first half of the movie you're basically watching the chemistry between the two characters. That's just how \"Meeting Evil\" plays out. Good ideas that never seem to wrap themselves up. The ending to the film is a prime example of that as for the type of movie this is, it's the type where a solid ending is needed but this one likes to leave on an open note.For those reasons I didn't enjoy Meeting Evil much. The majority of the show is watching people being senselessly murders (although it's portrayed very well adding mystery and allure to how Richie works)but the movie never seems to have any uplifting moments or any point to it. It's very dark and leaves you feeling kind of in a hopeless place watching the killer roam free and John dragged into it. There really aren't any heroes in this movie just victims. There's no one to cheer for and Samuel Jackson with make you hate him by the time the final scenes come up. He just completely Evil in this movie and maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it so much. Usually when Samuel Jackson plays a villain he has some trait that makes him likeable but, in this movie he is just sadistically evil.Without spoiling the movie which is easy to do as there are few twists in the shallow story, you really are just watching a movie about a pathetic man whose life turns upside down thanks to not only the killer that bumps into his life but the people that the man trusts as well turn out not to be on his side either.Overall I give the movie about a 2.5 out of 5. I didn't enjoy watching it but, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I can see others watching it and enjoy it as it does have it's good points but for me personally it's just not my taste."
B007PYEWZ8 MEETING EVIL was pulled from its theatrical release after its opening weekend gross of $181(!!!).  While not a classic, I found it entertaining in a quirky sort of way.Luke Wilson plays a down on his luck realtor who finds himself in financial and marital woes.  Samuel L. Jackson shows up at his door and Wilson's troubles have just gotten worse.Wilson plays the sheepish role with his usual non-chalance, which works better in his comedic roles.  A more intense actor like James Franco might have strengthened the movie.  I'm not a big fan of Jackson, who always seems to play the same role in all his films.  His villainy in MEETING EVIL isn't totally convincing.  We needed a Michael C. Hall or Michael Douglas---a different kind of menace,  Leslie Bibb is pretty effective as Wilson's assertive spouse and Tracie Thoms (TV's COLD CASE) is surprisingly good as one of the skeptical cops.  Peyton List (TV's FLASH FORWARD) and Muse Watson (NCIS) are okay in under-developed roles.The ending is rather anti-climactic which is disappointing, but MEETING EVIL is a modest time-waster."
B007PYEWZ8 This is one of those rare movies that I knew nothing about going in and frankly not much coming out.  The film opens with a sinister stranger named Richie (a scene chewing Samuel L. Jackson) knocking on the door of suburbanite John Fleton (Luke Wilson), despondent over the loss of his job.  It seems Richie has car trouble as asks John for a push.  One nit to pick is that Richie's GTO appears to have an automatic transmission, so there is no clutch to \"pop.\"  I digress.Somehow, Richie gets John to go with him after John's leg is injured.  This might be something expected in some teen horror movie but what kind of idiot is middle aged John?  Now I'm still trying to figure out if this is some dark comedy, a horror film or just a by-the-numbers psycho-thriller.  Richie and John travel the area, with several diversions by Richie that result in numerous deaths including at least one kid.  John's wife Joanie (Leslie Bibb) becomes involved after the murders are linked to her morose husband.  One of the police detectives raises the issue of life insurance which of course, throws a possible murder-for-hire scheme into the mix.  Ultimately we don't get many answers in this poorly written disjointed mess."
B007PYEWZ8 Samuel Jackson is good and playing a bad guy!  This movie was worth the buy it before its in movies price of $9.99. This is a great suspense thriller that kept my attention from start to finish.  If you like Samuel Jackson then you will like this movie!"
B007PYEWZ8 Now this takes you on  ride you don't expect. Get it, buy it and watch it to the end... it was very good. again, convincing great acting... action... thriller.... good time spent for all."
B007PYEWZ8 Meeting Evil(released May/12)stars Samuel L. Jackson as Richie,Luke Wilson as John Felton and others,in this surprisingly enjoyable but tense thriller/drama about a man on the edge,who ignores the warning signs when a psychotic killer comes a calling.John Felton is a real estate agent who lives in a subdivision which has got more empty houses due to bankruptcy and foreclosures,than folks occupying them.He comes home,on his birthday,after losing his job and is contemplating his future when there is a knock on the door.Standing there is Richie,a black man,intense in nature,with a fedora,who says his car stalled in front of his house.He asks John for a push and he obliges him.After a few feet the car starts but as it does it stops suddenly,hurting Johns leg.Ritchie offers him a ride to the hospital and he reluctantly goes,despite his uneasy feeling about the man.Along the way John gets ever the more reluctant about Ritchie.They stop for gas where a young attendant gets on the wrong side of Ritchie.While John stays in the car Ritchie goes into the 7-11 style premises and John can see some kind of kerfuffle inside.Just then Ritchie reappears saying the gas was free,and they leave.Instead of going to the hospital they end up at a bar.John had forgotten his wallet,so he goes to a place that sells phones.The lady there is really rude and he leaves.He tries to use the phone inside the bar but has no money.He finds an old girlfriend inside who ultimately offers him and Ritchie a ride home.Before they leave Ritchie has paid a visit to the rude woman in the phone store and has returned verifying her attitude to John.Ritchie guides them to the impound(his car had been towed in front of the bar),but time passes and they are getting farther and farther to nowhere.By this time Ritchie has become much stranger in his behaviour.A trucker suddenly comes up and runs the car off the road,and the driver confronts John.He tells John he murdered his girlfriend(the unfriendly phone woman).Unnoticed by the trucker,Ritchie gets in Johns girlfriend's car and runs the driver over,and they leave.They find a farm driveway soon after and they drive into it.It is apparent Ritchie knows the place,but John finds a phone and is able to get part of his call out to the police about the incident on the highway,before he is cut off.By now John and his girlfriend know this man is just not right in the head and are very uneasy about their safety.Ritchie confines both to the farm,when a cop drives up.While Ritchie kills the cop,the two escape and head out through cornfields and part ways.John walks for a long time until he finally reaches a roadway and a cop car finally arrives.He drops to his knees,only to find the cop is Ritchie in disguise.Ritchie makes John put on the troopers hat and while Ritchie slumps in the back seat,John drives right through a police barricade.Once past Ritchie lets John out and he runs for freedom.He reaches a busy highway and starts stopping cars for help.A police car finally arrives and arrests him for the number of murders they think he has committed.John explains about Ritchie but they do not believe him.Eventually his girl friend shows up in police custody and she verifies his story.John is let free and his wife is there to meet him at the police station.Back home the two are settling back in when there is a knock at the door.Unbeknownst to his wife,who answers,it is Ritchie in disguise as a cop.He comes in and they start chatting.Not too far along she starts getting suspicious about him because of his off hand remarks.When John comes into the living room the cat is out of the proverbial bag.Ritchie explains that his wife has been unfaithful to him by having relations with the pool man;the very reason he came in the first place.Coincidentally(or not),at the beginning of the film when John arrived home,he was greeted by the pool man walking out his driveway.John holds his wife at knife point,at Ritchie's urgings,and when Ritchie approaches John,John stabs him instead.A fight ensues which ends up in a mud hole in the backyard,filled with rain water.The police arrive,and at the critical moment they shoot Ritchie dead.The film ends as John and his wife sit in bed,with the wife asking whether everything will be alright.There is no answer.This film makes one think of what one would do in John's shoes,i.e.would we ignore the warning signs?It makes one identify easier with John as he gets sucked down ever more into Ritchie's quagmire.Jackson plays Ritchie beautifully.He has this maniacal look and attitude,but is always just sitting on the edge.He doesn't go over the edge at John,whom for some reason he\"likes\",but takes things out on others like the lady who offended John at the phone place,or the customers and employees of the 7-11 style gas store.You wait for Ritchie to lose it on John,but it never happens.But that also keeps the tension high at all times.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and is clear and crisp.There are,unfortunately,no extras.All in all a nice,taut thriller which has Samuel Jackson on top of his game playing an intense,psychotic killer type,who stalks Wilson,who is at his wits end in his life.Wilson learns alot about himself and his life through it all.4 solid stars."
B007PYEWZ8 \"Meeting Evil\" is a movie of stupefying logic, inept writing, willful unpleasantry and a couple of good actors who are cashing checks and hoping no one sees them. To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn. This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies (Collateral, Kalifornia, Cape Fear, Jackson's own Lakeview Terrace), so surprises aren't exactly in store, the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people, they don't even bear any resemblance to movie characters; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime, and it is for no discernible reason. Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself, but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply. This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained, perhaps have never seen a better movie, or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.The plot has timed, mild mannered real estate agent John (Luke Wilson) having a real sad sack of a day, he lost his job, his mortgage is in foreclosure, he has a stack of bills that read \"past due\", and he fights with his wife (Leslie Bibb) for no particular reason. Then Richie (Samuel L. Jackson) enters his life, at first unassuming, but soon he reveals his very dark nature. Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree, a dozen in under an hour from my calculations, and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride. Richie's motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him, or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him. Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities, of course it all ends at John's house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.The film tries to work on a more psychological level, I guess, but it totally fails. The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character, it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil, possibly even the devil himself, but he is actually just a remorseless killer, or is he. The film leads to a dubious denouement, followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti-climax. This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study, but it has no characters to study.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation, but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut, he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen (The Cleaner, Unthinkable, Arena) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks. Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character, something else he has been doing a lot of lately, after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch. Luke Wilson doesn't fare much better, in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite, tedious material. But some of the supporting work is much worst, I suspect some of these \"actors\" were just friends, relatives, or investors. Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police, embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran, and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.Directed by Chris Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors), I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb, I soon discovered why I did not know him. Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct-to-dvd potboilers, titles like \"S. Darko\", \"Street Kings 2: Motor City\", \"Dirty\", \"Nightstsalker\", \"Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders\". \"Meeting Evil\" is Fisher's first theatrical film, well sort of, you see it's premiering on cable/satelite TV and then video on demand, before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters. I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face, but they shouldn't have bothered, his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.I know, I know  if you can't say anything nice, ...just one more thing, please. Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography, provided by Marvin V. Rush, a close collaborator on some of Fisher's previously mentioned glories. Even at roughly ninety minutes \"Meeting Evil\" truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture. Yes, I believe that this the definition of torture porn."
B007PYEWZ8 John (Luke Wilson) sells real estate but doesn't sell enough as the bills are mounting. While his wife (Leslie Bibb) is out for a walk, Samuel L. Jackson stops by and through a series of events, John is riding shotgun in a well dressed Jackson's GTO...a man we know has issues. Jackson acts a bit psychotic, confrontational, and criminal, so much so John wants him to take him back home.John, without his cell phone or wallet, finds himself in the uncomfortable position where he is at the mercy of strangers. (Un)fortunately he meets Tammy, an office affair and the threesome take off down the road in her car. Jackson seems to know more about these people than he should. Jackson seems to have been written as John's alter ego. He is what the meek mild John is holding inside. Only together can they be complete. This becomes apparent when Jackson proclaims, \"We are in this together.\"The movie ends with a twist, but not one without hints. The movie was good, and a cut above other \"B\" abduction type films. 4 1/2 stars.F-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
B007PYEWZ8 Meeting Evil surprised the hell out of me! When I read the description, I wasn't all that interested, but because Samuel L. Jackson was in it, I figured I'd give it twenty minutes or so, and I'm glad I did! This dark, independent, thriller was one of the most edgy, exciting films I've seen all year. Luke Wilson plays John, a man down on his luck. Suddenly, a stranger comes knocking at his door, and that leads to an unbelievable chain of events that ends with a twist that you will never see coming. Jackson is terrific as always, whether he's the good guy or the bad guy, he's always so entertaining and always manages to call someone racist, I love that! As for his co-star, Luke Wilson, I kept waiting for his character to open up, to have some kind of reaction to what was happening, but he doesn't, still his performance was a strong one. What I really liked about this film was how you really didn't know what was going to happen next. It seems like a small thing, but very few films like this go to such extremes and turn out to be so unpredictable. I can honestly say, when that twist was revealed at the end, I almost fell out of my chair. Yes, Meeting Evil is an independent film, but its better than any thriller that's come out this year. The acting is terrific, the story will have you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, you find out that you don't know a thing. This was a tremendous movie that fell way under the radar, but I found it, and you should most definitely check it out for yourself."
B007PYEWZ8 \"The world hurts people John, I come in after the hurt. All I do is kill people who are already dead.\" John (Wilson) is having a bad day. He didn't sell the house he wanted and lost his job. Just when he thinks it can't get any worse Richie (Jackson) shows up and asks for help with his car. Soon he becomes involved in a murderous rampage that he can't escape from. I have to start by saying that I am not a big Sam Jackson fan at all. To me he really can't act and plays himself in pretty much every movie he does. That said it really works in this movie. Wilson is good as a weak willed man taken in my Jackson's fast talking character. This is a movie where you feel tense almost the entire time and that feeling adds to the excitement of the movie. The movie kept me guessing the entire time and actually had a little twist at the end that I was not expecting. This movie is a little unbelievable but that doesn't hurt the movie at all. I wasn't sure what to expect from this going in and I was very surprised at how much I liked it. Overall, a tense and exciting thriller that is very much worth watching. I liked it. I give it a B+."
B007PYEWZ8 Perhaps the fact that \"Meeting Evil\" is written and directed by someone responsible for \"S. Darko,\" a pointless and confusing \"sequel\" to a cult classic \"Donnie Darko,\" would be worth mentioning. Yes, \"Meeting Evil\" is a mess. Well, it's not exactly a total mess, thanks to the star Samuel L. Jackson and his mesmerizing performance, though I would rather be watching him in a superhero franchise or Quentin Tarantino film.Luke Wilson plays John Felton, a down-and-out real estate agent, who is visited by a mysterious guy, Samuel L. Jackson's \"Richie.\" Richie seems interested in John, who, dejected and angry, barely controls his emotions. Richie follows John, even when it is obvious John doesn't like it, and wherever Ritchie goes, strange things happen, like people suddenly disappearing.So who is Richie and what is his motive? Without revealing too much about the movie, I would only say that the story doesn't make much sense. The storyline is incoherent and illogical (not in an intriguing way like a David Lynch film), and the subplot about a young woman Tammy (Peyton List) goes nowhere. You notice so many lapses of logic and so much inexplicable decision-making, hoping that they will be explained away before the film ends.But that doesn't happen. (You don't see a big explosion on the DVD jacket, either, if I remember correctly). About 30 minutes in, the film gets boring as we come to realize that the film is nothing but a poorly assorted collection of clich&eacute; ideas."
B007PYEWZ8 This movie is proof that if a movie isn't marketed correctly it won't succeed at the theatres. I loved the suspense, and Samuel L. Jackson played evil so convincingly, that it was, at times, terrifying to even look at him. This is probably a lower budget movie but I loved it! Great ending too! Don't be fooled by the fact that it didn't get top billing at the theatre. Neither did Galaxy Quest, but it is now a cult classic.If you enjoy this type of genre, Samuel L Jackson (Truly at his most evil), and surprise endings, watch this movie. If you are a Prime member you get to see it free, so you lose nothing. Really enjoyable film!"
B007PYEXL6 I watched this because I have a deep interest in Roman history. I may have been spoiled because I had watched \"Rome\" before this one, and in comparison this production seems very . . . well, much less polished and well produced.I was not impressed by the acting or production. All together it seemed rather mediocre."
B007PYEXL6 This historic video first came out in the seventies and my work schedule forbade the viewing of all of these marvelous episodes. When I noticed &#34;I,Claudius&#34; on Prime I jumped at the chance to watch it.The dialog is superb and rockets you back to ancient Rome as if aboard a time machine; the acting is top notch !Well written,well produced, well directed and above all well acted; an ageless story brought to us in a format for the ages. You will not be disappointed.( Contains adult material),Richie"
B007PYEXL6 It is one of the best performances ever captured on film. The depth of the ensemble cast is mind blowing."
B007PYEXL6 I remember watching the series years ago on TV and was pleased to see it listed on Amazon Instant Videos.  The whole cast is marvelous, the history is shocking, and the series is highly entertaining and educational.  I would recommend this series to anyone who wants to understand more about the early Roman Empire and the family backstabbing that shaped the rise and fall of Rome."
B007PYEXL6 I first saw I, Claudius on PBS many years ago and on the off chance it was available I looked it up on Amazon.  This mini-series is well acted and very  true to the books it was based on.  This was the first film I ever saw with Derek Jacobi.  Since then, I have watched anything I come across with him in it.  I wish all mini-series were this well done.  If you like historical dramas, this is the series for you."
B007PYEXL6 Educational and thoroughly enjoyable on many levels.  Highly recommended.  Great story with fantastic acting.  It doesn't get much better than I, Claudius."
B007PYEXL6 When I saw this series twenty years ago, I was very affected by the way the families and royalty of Rome must have lived. It is shocking to see the evil that flourished in the Roman Empire at the time.Rome may have been the Cradle of Civilization, but it was also the cauldron where the seven deadly sins could nurture and grow and repeat generation after generation. Serial killers seem to have abounded there, and if that didn't affect you maybe the lead in the drinking vessels did! (That was not mentioned for obvious reasons). Livia really scared me; Claudius was a real survivor and by the end, I was not surprised of his entire life being one of abuse from others (with a few exceptions that I was glad for). What can I say about Caligula that hasn't already been said? He is so thoroughly evil and misguided and insane.They say this miniseries is the most watched of all time and I can believe it. It is a fascinating study of the darkest parts of humankind. It is very well acted and well written. I can't help but give it 5 stars! Thank you!"
B007PYEXL6 Though 37 years old, this series stands the test of time.  It is a magnificent glimpse into the plotting, back room dealing and intrigue that went on in the Roman royal family during the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius.  Claudius' grandmother, Livia, is especially deadly.  I've lost count of all of the family members she poisoned or had murdered.  In some regards, it's amazing that any of them survived.  Sadly, it seemed all of the better members of the royal household ended up dead, and the worst ones, like Tiberius and Caligula, somehow managed to survive.Great story.  Great acting.  Great entertainment.  A definite thumbs up."
B007PYEXL6 If only the budget for this exceptionally good series had been what could have been offered today!  This is the epitome of good writing put together with excellent acting and plausible human characters fleshed out in detail and given properly understandable motives for their actions,so that their talk and behavior seems like real people doing real things in real time.  The intricacies of their relationships and the development of the characters across the different episodes is plausible and entrancing.  The interpretation of some historical events is plausible as imaginative pseudo-fiction, even if disputed by some experts, and cannot be fully supported by historical sources (many of which are lost).  However the detective work in putting together a credible theme running through the mysterious events of the Julio-Claudian family was, after all, done by a writer who was thoroughly versed in classical history and he made a decent stab at interpreting what he read and at bringing it to life.It casts into stark relief the poverty of plot, research and writing of such recent disasters as Vikings and Rome"
B007PYEXL6 I watched this series when it originally aired on PBS in the US on Masterpiece Theatre.  At that time it was--for me--groundbreaking TV, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As I watch it now, I have tended to focus on the mediocre technical production quality.  And it still does not detract from t
B007PYF66W This is yet another Brit TV show with real characters and great acting with a touch of humor thrown in.Lots of familiar faces in the cast including the lead actor Alan Davies who is always enjoyable."
B007PYF66W The lightness of the character protagonist belies an underlying constant:  frittering away his life and resources on gambling.  This weighs so heavily that one can only wonder at how very much more clever he could be in the court room and in life  without horses and dogs to bet on.  The court room scenarios are first rate, not heavy handed or arduous as is so often the case with such dramas from the US, and I enjoy seeing criminal life without guns.  When all is said and done, the complicated family relationships, the complicated female relationships and the complicated colleague relationships, the law is the thing.  He lives for it and would not have a life without it.  This passion, albeit not totally fulfilling, sustains his life and his destiny.  Well worth the character study."
B007PYF66W The writing and story makes it very enjoyable to watch. English TV series are so well written and the actors are seasoned performers, not just cute."
B007PYF66W I'm a fan of Alan Davies comedies so I didn't know how I would like him as a serious actor. He's great. He plays a character who is a tough mix of really smart attorney with a complicated personal life & a gambling addiction to boot. Through it all he remains kind to everyone but himself."
B007PYF66W I really enjoyed this quality production --- love Alan Davies --- and loved the insight into &#34;chambers&#34;.  Great characters, good sub stories."
B007PYF66W Good series. Held my attention enough to want to see all the episodes. Enjoyed the characters, actors and stories. Giving it 3 stars because it was enjoyable, but doesn't hold up to better, seasoned British shows such as Prime Suspect."
B007PYFAJ0 I wasn't sure I would like this at the start, as it seems very slow and rather chauvenistic.  However, by the end of the first episode, I decided it was worth another viewing to see how the characters develop.  Not something I have to rush to view, but will be back."
B007PYFAJ0 I enjoy watching this heroine and the cases she is involved in. Although the cases are gruesome, she handles herself in this season very well. Later on, she sheds a few tears and because I like this heroine, I am sympathetic and feel that those that have provoked her to cry are crass."
B007PYFAJ0 If you like action this is the series for you, lots of drama, action and very interesting.  I watched all the season's in a week."
B007PYFAJ0 At first I wasn't sure I was going to get into this, but it gets better and better. Kelly Reilly is especially delicious. You'll enjoy it."
B007PYFAJ0 This is a likable police drama, but has no John Frankenheimer SNaP cRacKlE PoP like &#34;Spiral&#34; or &#34;Wallander&#34; (the Swedish original) or the recent film &#34;The Prey&#34;. Its more of a plodder, unfortunately a bit too chauvinistic, and it failed in allowing Ms. Travis to forcefully overcome with sheer ingenuity. Kelly Reilly is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the small screen. Its a good watch so start at one and enjoy. Waiting for season 4 and then &#34;cheerio&#34; to all."
B007PYFAJ0 U watched 2 seasons of these adaptions from some very good novels.  The actors were OK, but I cringed every time I tried to relate to Langton."
B007PYFAJ0 Interesting characters, script, and acting. Love BBC productions!  I can't wait to see Series 4 when it's available to stream"
B007PYFAJ0 OK series. Love Cieran Hinds though. He's excellent as usual. Maybe I was just in a strange mood when I watched this."
B007PYFAJ0 Horrific murder detective case with good acting and plenty of twists and turns.  Not for the faint or young viewer"
B007PYFAJ0 Well written, well cast, good production quality and interesting.  We watched this previously and were hoping for more episodes.  We will keep checking for anything new."
B007PYFAJ0 Somewhat predictable, but nevertheless done very well-- the characters are involving and sympathetic, the undercurrents emerge slowly, the police plodding through their investigation fascinating. Linda LaPlante's books have been favorites and this does not disappoint at all. Kelly Reilly as the unassuming young female DC who makes all the right connections in the case is perfect. Not loud, brash and in your face as the new girl trying to prove herself, just focused on getting the job done well for her statement. Hooray!"
B007PYFAJ0 I must have closed captions (as a hearing impaired person). I chose this program because the listing summary indicated that it was closed captioned. Enjoyed part 1 and then was very unhappy to discover part 2 is not captioned. Cannot understand why this situation exists. Better to have left off the CC indicator on part 1 and not fool us who are hard of hearing."
B007PYFAJ0 British television seems to churn out these mystery standards. Some are better than others (&#34;Vera&#34; is terrific), but nearly all are worth watching. And they get such wonderful actors involved: Ciaran Hinds is a delight."
B007PYFAJ0 Gritty British Crime Thriller features some standard heavies and a fresh young female who gives more by emoting less.  Kelly Reilly who plays a new DC in the homicide unit goes through all the rookie hazing but still keeps kicking.  Her quiet tenacity wins the day in the midst of a gruesome serial sexual predator.  Warning, Brits love nudity and utter depravity in their bad guys and this one will scramble your eggs if you let him."
B007PYFAJ0 I've only watched a couple of episodes, but it's not for me.  The violence and graphic murder scenes just don't define what I consider entertainment.  That being said, I'm sure it will be very popular to many."
B007PYFAJ0 Ouch! Remind me to read the reviews and why it was recommended in the future. Perhaps the idea was to overwhelm the viewer with sensationalism to cover the qualities of the actors. The part of the 'actor' (Allen Daniels) is the most convincing. The plot is reasonable but it seems to lose it's way within the flashes of the past. If one watches part one, part two becomes almost inevitable viewing. Interesting for those who enjoy this genre . . . not recommended for those who are serious students of military history and wander into 'recommended' without questioning why!"
B007PYFAJ0 No! Watched 30 minutes and turned it off. Too edgy, gross, and dragy. Too many other good shows to fall for this one."
B007PYFAJ0 Interesting characters and a good mystery. The UK TV mysteries tend to run longer than our 45 minute police procedurals and can pack in more about the characters and provide more depth to the story. The female lead  shows intellect and skills at handling being the only woman detective in the room."
B007PYFAJ0 I thought that I would never see a more \"depraved\" serial killer than Kevin Spacey in the American movie, \"Seven.\"  However, the British have managed to do it!  Season 2 of this British TV detective series was great, but Season 1 was off the charts -- at least in my book.  Pure evil!"
B007PYFAJ0 This did not disappoint. Can't wait to watch more. I love having a female star in the major role. Good to watch anytime."
B007PYFAJ0 With the current movie &#34;Heaven is for real&#34; and the new TB show &#34;Black Box&#34; Kelley Riley is everywhere, deservedly so. This show based on Lynda La Plait's series is a hit, good story line, great caste. I loved the characters in the book and even more so in this BBC TV series. If you like James Patterson you will love &#34;Above Suspicion&#34; season 1 & 2. a real nail bitter."
B007PYFAJ0 Dialogue good. Acting good. Story good. But not as good as others, George Gently or Jack Taylor. Try the other two series first."
B007PYFAJ0 Season 1 was my favorite season thus far ... I was surprised, pleasantly with the actors, the intelligence of the story line ... and the actors chemistry together.  It's subtle - which is the best kind of Chemistry!"
B007PYFAJ0 Terrific series, not perfect, but very, very good. Outstanding acting. Once again, the Brits eat our lunch. Watch this original before it gets remade in America and turned into an unwatchable pos."
B007PYFAJ0 I have long been a fan of British police dramas as well as the dry English wit (notwithstanding Monty Python & company).  The set period lends itself well to demonstrating the less than enthusiastic welcome to women in a male dominated profession.  Excellent acting by all."
B007PYFAJ0 I ENJOYED THE SERIES BUT MY WIFE THOUGHT THEY WERE TOO BRUTAL, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS A NURSE.KELLY REILLY DOES A GREAT JOB AS A NEW FEMALE POLICE OFFICER TRYING TO FIT INTO THE UNIT. I THOUGHT THE PLOT WAS VERY TIGHT AND KEPT YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE END."
B007PYFAJ0 The series does the obvious demonstration that the apparent frazzled bimbo is actually highly intelligent and intuitive, but it adds an extra edge or two that keeps it fresh."
B007PYFAJ0 I enjoyed the acting - especially Ciaran Hinds.  The plots have fun twists, the to and fro between the actors is good to watch"
B007PYFAJ0 Ciaran Hinds is one of my favorite actors, so imagine my surprise, in watching this on an impulse (before reading reviews), to find him in it!  Amazon really needs to fine-tune its descriptions of Instant Video offerings.  While on the subject, am I the only one who's annoyed by the fact that they disclose major plot points in their episode descriptions- abandon ye ALL hopes of being surprised (yet, often don't bother to list the lead actors)??  Please fix this.***MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW*** I read a few of the reviews, and I agree with the quibbles about the lead actress behaving a little oddly, i.e., looking misty-eyed for no particular reason and wobbling about on stiletto heels after going through intensive DC training.  A slight qualm I had was the women referring to the main suspect as the handsomest man ever, with violet eyes that rivaled Liz Taylor's.  He wasn't, and they didn't, IMO.  And I believe I've seen nearly all of Hinds's films, something was decidely off about his accent- he sounded as though he was trying to effect an American accent part of the time (for example, his pronunciation of \"car\", bizarre).  Perhaps he was simultaneously working on an American production.But other than that, I thought it very well-done, absorbing, superb acting all around, especially in the final interrogation scene.  The two episodes were worth watching for that final scene alone.  I hate gratuitous violence- yes it was explicit, close to the bone, graphic, but NOT gratuitous, in my estimation, not designed merely to shock, but to get as close to the truth as possible (true of the entire show).  I thought the perpetrator's performance was a virtuoso one, chilling, an uber-realistic look into the mind and heart of a serial killer.  And the way his accent changed along with his demeanor and feelings, as he explored different time periods and memories- incredible, spot on.  I was absolutely riveted.  And the young DC matched him in intensity.As for reviewers deeming it impossible for romance to bloom between Ciaran Hinds and the young rookie, I can't agree there, were I in her shoes, I'd be smitten too.  Hinds is intelligent, wise, virile, authoritative, a little tired, craggy, yes, but with an engaging manner and twinkle in his eye, and in need of some TLC.  Irresistible.  And from a male perspective, Kelly Reilly has intriguing qualities of her own (among them, her tendency to discern issues/ angles that haven't occurred to others).  I liked those moments between them, and their subtlety.  While it's no Masterpiece Theater, it's certainly better than 99% of American CSI-type shows.  And as another reviewer wryly suggested, the Brits (with tongues firmly planted in their cheeks) handily beat Americans at their own game (cleavage, spike heels, maggots, red herrings, etc.)!  They did it SO much better.  Recommended!"
B007PYFAJ0 This has been done so much better so many times .... both in books and film that I found it to be quite dull and predictable.  Characters are stereotypes.  I don't know who to blame -- producer?  writer?  director?  I watched 30 minutes then skipped to the end to see if I had figured out who did it  -- I had, but anyone familiar with the genre would do the same."
B007PYFAP4 I gave it 4 stars because of the quality of the story. Acting and plot are very good and will keep you guessing."
B007PYFAP4 I like this show very much.  It keeps my interest.  I don't get bored.  It is interesting to see a different setting than our American crime shows."
B007PYFAP4 I believe that the 3 part Red Dahlia mystery is referred to as season 2. This is a bit misleading, since it directly follows the Pilot. Be careful that you do not buy it twice.It is very graphic with realistic corpses. Not for younger viewers or the least bit squeamish. The series relies more on character interplay than mystery.Good acting with an interesting mix of characters. Ciarn Hinds plays the experienced police detective in a believable manner. Kelly Reilly is by turns engaging and frustrating off as a novice detective. The hit and miss performance could have added to the feel of a novice learning, but didn't quite get there. The director seems to concentrate on her charms far more than on getting a good performance out of her.The 3 part Deadly Intent followed by the 3 part Silent Scream come next."
B007PYFAP4 good intensity, Hinds is great, great energy between the actors. well written story that maintains my attention. I do recommend."
B007PYFAP4 The Cast is very top notch. Never boring. Always well-acted. Keep the series going. The whole cast were excellent choices"
B007PYFAP4 I love anything by La Plante and I must confess, anything from Acorn and the Brits.  They know how to do it right.  Their leads have flaws, physical as well as emotional and what you see is what you get.  No silicone, plastic, botox, etc. The crimes are brutal, but what crime isn't.  Most are gory--this series is no exception.  The two leads are well cast and you do begin to pick up on the magnetism they have,  I am just so happy Amazon acquired these 2 seasons, and I hope there will be more available.  If you like the stuff on the networks, you won't like this, but if you are a fan of a really good mystery with great acting and a great script, you will enjoy this series."
B007PYFAP4 Well acted and written but this is a copy cat murder that is very graphic and not to be viewed by the young viewer."
B007PYFAP4 I watch primarily for the sight of Ciaran Hinds and find Kelly Reilly distracting (I like her better as Mrs. Watson). Somehow this plot did not come together for me."
B007PYFAP4 Other than finding the young heroine a little hard to like, I thought the storyline was excellent and the photography very good as well.  The Brits don't hesitate to add a little grit and horror to their crimes even when they are imitating an American classic serial killer.  I have to say that the ending was remarkably satisfying...no spoilers here."
B007PYFAP4 Love this series. The young female detective is strong willed and smart. The show is exciting and fast moving and I really enjoy it."
B007PYFAP4 `Deadly Intent,' Bestselling thriller of Lynda La Plante, is gritty, fast action, violent crime, and edgy. La Plante (Crime Thriller Writer's Hall of Fame) again lets a sexy female scrap her way into the man's world of murder crime fighting. She's raised the TV acceptance bar for coarse realism of London crime fighting. The ongoing series is lead by Kelly Reilly (Sherlock Holmes x2,Poldark: The Complete Collection), now DI Travis, with her pixie face and tight clothes. She has more confidence, and more suitors. DCS Langton (Ciaran Hinds- `Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy') is the tough, tetchy boss overstepping and infiltrating on the territory of case head, DCI Lewis (Shaun Dingwall).SUBTITLES for all 3 parts (and bonus footage).It opens with a Mexican doctor doing a realistic facelift. Ugh! [The filmed doctor was a real plastic surgeon doing the role. That's realism.]One year later . . .London ex-cop Brandon is killed in a crack house. His wife, Julia (Stine Stengade), is unfazed. DI Travis wants to know why. The murder scene includes, besides blood, body and bullets, Fentanyl, drug known on the street as \"Drop Dead.\"Conflict abounds in the situation room as Travis pursues her own clues, Lewis has a family distraction, and Langston was a past friend/colleague with the victim. DCI Power (Ray Fearon), drug squad, adds inter-circle anxiety.Julia's sister (Benedikte Hansen) and brother-in-law (Julian Sands- Room with a View), an Oxford bio-chem professor, provide answers.But related deaths rise and a confession doesn't end this case. A new threat is massively deadly. Travis makes a connection. Some male staff try to make personal contact with her, proving she may just be too HOT for the team.Cops hurry to avoid Julia becoming the 4th victim. Confessions and CCTV helps the case move toward an identity. But a Colombian drug cartel is also in pursuit.And the winner is . . .And the loser is . . .This is the 3rd  story in this series, streamed in the US prior to DVD release.Above Suspicion, Set 1has two cases.NEXT: \"Above Suspicion: Silent Scream\" This series is proving to be as intensely stimulating as La Plante's \"Prime Suspect.\"`"
B007PYFAP4 I don't know why it is, but the Brits just do a terrific job with mystery series, particularly those involving serial killers.  Ciaran Hinds is just marvelous as strong willed DCI James Langton and Kelly Reilly is equally as interesting as the &#34;new kid on the block&#34; so to speak.  This series has some of the most arresting villains I have ever seen on TV.  If mystery is your cup of tea, do not miss this series.  Thank you Amazon Fire for introducing me to this terrific show!!"
B007PYFAP4 This was a suprise for me as I had never watched any of these shows.  I must say this was very good and a must for all British Police show fans."
B007PYFAP4 Good stories . Good acting . I just  recently saw Kelly  Reilly in a tv series on American channel  Had no idea that she was British. Very good series . I would watch many more episodes if they come about."
B007PYFAP4 She carries the whole show. I still can't believe she is doctor Watson's wife in the Sherlock Holmes movies.If your a male and love eye candy then watch this show."
B007PYFAP4 Well written with interesting characters and relationships in the detective squad. Longer form than most US TV series for one story, this makes for an enjoyable few hours."
B007PYFAP4 Ensemble interaction is first rate.  Suspend imagination and just let the story unfold as crazy as it is and enjoyable at same time.  Well done by all involved!"
B007PYFAP4 I enjoyed watching this series, and recommend it to everyone. It is fairly realistic, with interesting characters. I like it."
B007PYFAP4 Clever intertwining with the real Black Dahlia case.  Again a really good series I would like to see more of."
B007PYFAP4 If you are an avid fan of Hollywood, perhaps, you should move on.  This film is from Acorn Media.  Therefore, it is a classic British TV detective series, which means there's lots of blood and gore and twisting plots.  Also, being British, these features are as much about the crime as they are about the detectives themselves.  This means that there's lots of drinking, politically-incorrect sexual relations, and questionable police tactics.  These typically British coppers are very human -- and very flawed characters.  I love it, but it may not be for you!"
B007PYFAP4 The concept of this show was great but the writing didn't measure up. I liked the cast but again the characters seemed very superficial. It almost seemed like the writers couldn't be bothered to do any heavy-lifting. It's too bad because it could have been a wonderful series."
B007PYFAP4 Another British show that I will watch. I love the main characters, so real and believable. Hope it stays on for many years."
B007PYFAP4 I really like this series but have a hard time absorbing some of the over the top vioence.  However, I will continue to watch the videos.  Such is man."
B007PYFAP4 I have to admit that I have watched each episode three times now. The plots are very interesting. I there is something about looking into Kelly's eyes."
B007PYFAP4 A. S. Season 2 - was even more surprising; more revelations; the story more twisted - a shocking conclusion - a bit &#34;sick&#34; - but I still watched.  You will too!"
B007PYFAP4 This is a really good detective show which is fun to watch because the main characters are interesting. Graphic at times when showing crime scenes."
B007PYFAP4 It was OK to pass the time but there wasn't any real substance to it. They tried to make the girl the one who broke the cases, but she really didn't do anything special. They pronounce dahlia like day-lia and it sounds weird, too."
B007PYFAP4 Black Dahlia features an excellent cast working off well written scripts. The concept: is there s copycat killer following the details of long unsolved LA murders, allows for wink and a nod to cop shows of the past while remaining fresh. Typical BBC restraint: cerebral and still fast paced enough to keep 21st century viewers tuned in."
B007PYFAP4 One no more begins feeling sympathy for one of these characters and then you want them wasted. An interesting and nicely non-American approach where characters are a mix of qualities rather than simplistic cartoon. Ciaran Hinds is always interesting and the young detective working with him is equally engaging."
B007PYFAP4 I am a big fan of Lynda LaPlant's work and wish this series went longer.  Would like the series to run longer."
B007PYFAP4 Can't wait to see Season 4 over in the States.  Hoping that this excellent cast continues for many seasons to come."
B007PYFAP4 The woman detective can really act, the photography is great, and the plot thickens...... scary and good just like I like MURDER"
B007PYFAP4 loved the story but a little gory for my taste yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,yes, yes, yes, yes yes."
B007PYFAP4 Not especially engaging and definitely only worth the 'free' episodes from Amazon Prime.  Ciaran Hind is always good - not much else"
B007PYFAP4 really like the show, but series 4 is not on prime, which is a disapointment.  since I pay for Prime,  I should be able to get all the episodes."
B007PYFAP4 As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan, as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds (e.g.,Law & Order Criminal Intent), I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two-part episode (Anna's wobbly spike heels, the short skirt, the misty eyed but knowing looks, her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor, etc.), and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene, dynamite, she showed what she's made of, mettle-wise, matching the perp in intensity.  His crimes made sense, though there were gruesome details galore, they struck me as realistic, not gratuitous or designed merely to shock.  I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads, where would it lead?  Then I watched \"seasons\" 2 and 3.Gratuitous, preposterous.  So many gaffes, overlooked leads and details, FOR EXAMPLE, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3, they did NO background check on the perp's brother (!), and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp's son at the last minute- gosh, he might have gone there!  And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane, no typing in of the plane's serial number to see what/where it might be, absurd.  The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER.  MANY plot points are left totally unexplained.  It's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE: Season 2, if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity, much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people's brains with glee, this may be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you'd like a story that makes SENSE as well.  ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders, but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her, also sexually tortures his son and daughters, operates on and removes his daughter's reproductive organs, for FUN.  I couldn't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case, but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity, or the dynamics of the coppers' interpersonal relationships, or what makes the characters tick, but no such luck.  The leads and the other officers evince one-dimensional, erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors, ludicrous; for example, one of the daughters assaults detectives on two separate occasions, drawing blood, and no-one says a word (they don't even fight back, one just slinks away)!  They don't arrest people for assaulting police officers in the UK?  Also, they had the perpetrator's voice on tape (I think, or SHOULD have taped his calls), early on could've matched the voice prints, AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him, yet they don't arrest him, simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again.  When they finally do detain him, they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch, and, SURPRISE, he escapes.  And a detective sleeping with a reporter, \"accidentally\" affording him access to her case notes?  And with no repercussions?  COME ON.  Columbo or Inspector Morse this ain't.  Real UK cops must've had a field day with this twaddle.  I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment, but it's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense, (to me, anyway), seeSingle Handed: Natural Justice, a VERY dark (and profane, be forewarned), but superb Irish series available on Instant Video.  And BOTH seasons are free to Prime members."
B007PYFAP4 A little on the gruesome side, but entertaining . Kelly Reilly does  a great job, even the women seem to like her !"
B007QJD6R2 A cute series about a little town in Ireland. It's a British idea of a situation comedy. I liked it."
B007QJD6R2 After watching season 1, 2, and 3 it seemed that 4, 5, and 6 were a let down. I don't know if it's because I watched them in a relatively short time, but the last 3 seasons left me missing the first three. The acting was fine...maybe I just missed the characters."
B007QJD6R2 This season has a lost a lot of the charm and characters from the earlier seasons.  They just disappeared and we're not quite as fond of the new people and situations."
B007QJD6R2 The series has undergone many changes over time.  I liked Father Vincent.  He brought a more down to earth approach to his ministry.  The ending leaves you with the feeling that all would be well, if it had been a real story about a small community.  Overall the series was very entertaining."
B007QJD6R2 Even though I like the Robert Taylor, he can't save this season. The show keeps losing main characters without satisfying explanation. I don't like the new pub owner family, they're annoying. And the ending was too open-ended. I suppose it left it general for another season but just as well the series ended. Season 5 & 6 were kind of bland and sillier. I didn't really care about any of the characters anymore. Plus, the revolving door of priests was getting old."
B007QJD6R2 Like season 5, this one also lacks substance. The new priest doesn't fit the role and comes across as clueless. The story lines are confusing and hard to follow. When I finished it, I looked online to find out about the next season; to discover that there is no other season coming. Many of the ongoing stories were not finished as far as I'm concerned. Several relationships were left hanging.The first three seasons were great though."
B007QJD6R2 The first 5 seasons were outstanding because there was a continuity in the characters and their personalities.  Although the stories are still good and well written, too many new characters, town seem much larger,  After 5 seasons of superior performances, it understandable season 6 is the last of Ballykissangel."
B007QJD6R2 After season five, it appears that the writers ran out of lines. But then they had played the same main story for 5 seasons. Priests falls for woman, stops being a priest. While season six appears to have an independent story line, it is limping along. Which explains why no season 7."
B007QJD6R2 This season was not as good as the other 5 seasons. I really enjoyed the other ones very much but was let downWith this one."
B007QJD6R2 My wife and I watched every episode of each season and could not have been more pleased. It reminded us why we loved visiting small towns in Ireland. The people were so welcoming and friendly, and the landscape was unforgettable. The series captured all of this marvelously."
B007QJD6R2 Anyone who watches the five star earlier seasons must see what the characters who remain get involved in and solve their problems.  The viewer does not blend with the characters in the later seasons as much as the first season but, knowing what is possible with the story line, the viewer keeps looking for the passion and tension experienced in past episodes."
B007QJD6R2 This curate was quite good looking but his story did not make it for me. Also the loss of the actor who played the owner of the golf club was a real loss for the series. I did watch until the end, but I was not as impressed as the first two."
B007QJD6R2 This is a soap that makes you laugh and cry! Cheer on your favorites and boo the bad ones! I will watch this over and over..."
B007QJD6R2 When the series first started the Characters were great and the plot was really good. After the Bar owners death it kinda went down hill. The first priest fell in love with the Bar Owner and after her death he left. He was replaced by another priest who came from a monastery. This priest had a wild side sister who also live in Ballykissangel. During the first part of the series, the Constable's Wife fell in love with a former resident who's family wasn't liked very much. On the day the Constable's Wife was going to tell him she loved another man, the Constable died after rescuing a stranded couple who was caught by an in coming tied. I think the Constable knew what was up with his wife and went to the Cliff's near the ocean to kill himself. I also think he killed himself after the rescue. There are several Characters who stayed through the entire series. I must say they were really good. Over all I would watch this series again or recommend it."
B007QJD6R2 I agree with other reviews I have read about season 6 in that it was certainly different from the first 5 . The new characters seemed to have made the difference. Maybe should have quite while the writers were ahead. Loved the first 5 seasons."
B007QJD6R2 I really enjoyed the entire series of Ballykissangel. I was sad to see it end. Entertaining and funny with a little drama thrown in for good measure"
B007QJD6R2 It is just not the same without Niahm, Ambrose, Quigley, and Aidan the priest and sister Orla. The cast is only the minimum of what it was in the beginning."
B007QRER4K \"Eurekia\" was a totally entertaining series. I watched the entire series as I'd never seen it before. It was a bit fluffy, but in today's reality shows and crime drama, this was family friendly and didn't pretend to be anything it wasn't. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a program with engaging characters, suspense, at a reasonable price."
B007QRER4K Sadly this is he last season of the series but it was great none the less. I would still have loved more but all things come to an end eventually. Also not a bad price either :)."
B007QRER4K This series and the charioteers will be missed. I have enjoyed seeing what would happen every week and the calamities that would befall Jack Carter. I am happy that he and Alison finally got together and would love to have a house like he lives in although I would want it solar power backup due to the electrical grid problems.....LOL..."
B007QRER4K I loved this show when it was on but missed some of the episodes. Now I can watch the last season while working out."
B007QRER4K What can I say about Eureka?  Colin Ferguson and cast gave this quirky series so much heart and charm....loved this show and I HATE Syfy for cancelling it for stupid wrestling shows.  If you have not watched this show...give it a try.  You'll love it."
B007QRER4K this series is getting a little bit long in the tooth by season five but it is still one of the most endearing series that my family has watched. For the price&#8230; Definitely worth the entertainment value you receive. If you like the previous season she will like this."
B007QRER4K Eureka was one of my family's favorite shows and we are sorry to see it go since there was still likely a season or two of life left in the series. That being said, this episode did a good job closing the major plot lines, but did leave me wanting more. I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a spin-off on the Holly/Doug story or perhaps even with Sheriff Carter, but that is likely wishful thinking on my part.Recommended!CFH"
B007QRER4K We knew it was coming one of these days. I think they did a good and appropriate job of ending the series. If you remember episode 1, you can guess what the last scene will be. I will miss the characters of Eureka, but I thought this was a good curtain call."
B007QRER4K Much to our dismay, the show came to an end, boohoohoo! However, knowing it was The Final Season, the writers (and actors, of course) handled it well and closed it out terrifically. We miss our evenings watching Eureka -- we felt like the characters become old friends, but unlike some shows (i.e. LOST and/or HEROES), this one wrapped up well, closing off the story lines, not leaving anyone out, and with a relatively &#34;happy&#34; solution."
B007QRER4K You can watch this show with just about anyone and get some good laughs along with a dose of &#34;what could possibly happen next?&#34; The seasons got better each time, especially season 5. Too bad it ended. Love to see it come back again."
B007QRER4K Silly, imaginative, and fun science fiction series. Does contain various adult situations so I don't recommend this series to young viewers."
B007QRER4K Quirky show, great mindless entertainment.  We are slowly going through this season as we know it is the last.. and don't want it to end!"
B007QRER4K We started watching this series and got hooked.  I knew I was missing a connection between shows, so I came to Amazon to save my butt again, lol. It wasn't one of my favorite of the series, but it was good. Anyway, it completed my viewing of the entire season, tx Amazon video!"
B007QRER4K ***Possible plot SPOILERS in the first paragraph***EUREKA, in its fifth and final season, still throws caution to the winds, still dares to redefine itself. The Season 4 finale closed with an edge-of-your-seat cliffhanger, as the deep space mission to Titan was sabotaged during launch and the Astraeus crew deployed to some unknown destination. Season 5 revolves mostly around the wayward Astraeus crew as, moments after the events in the Season 4 finale, they return to Earth to learn that four years had elapsed and things had changed alarmingly for the worse. And so cue the shuffling of status quo and the relationship shake-ups and the drastic shifts in personality.But the more things change, et cetera... Eureka remains the most dangerous hidden community on the planet, with its unending barrage of faulty scientific experiments. Sheriff Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson, consistently awesome), the genius town's dimmest resident, still races around Eureka, saving the day with his common man's heroics. Five seasons in, he remains our likable point-of-view character. Still, whenever the egghead discussion swivels to topics like smart dust and body printing, no one puts on a more amusing baffled expression than Colin Ferguson.So who will die? Who will tie the knot? Who lands the unexpected promotion? Who gets an impressively menacing  heel turn? And who is the mole? And what is Matrix Eureka? The Astraeus crew's return unveils a sinister conspiracy. As usual, things aren't what they seem. Gratifyingly, recurring guest star Felicia Day is featured heavily in these shady shenanigans. I love that this season exudes a whiff of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. EUREKA is most notably a lighthearted sci-fi show, rife with screwball moments, but it does often enough raise the stakes and adopt a darker tone. It's all the more telling when a sense of paranoia is injected. In Eureka, home to enthusiastic mad scientists, the most improbably terrifying things are very much achievable.EUREKA is hands down my favorite series on SyFy. It's too bad that, ultimately, its episodes proved to be too expensive to keep making. And I guess it's better to go out on a high note. Season 5 gives us plenty of strong episodes. The first three episodes - \"Lost,\" \"The Real Thing,\" \"Force Quit\" - had me chewing my nails. \"Jack of All Trades\" showcases Ferguson's knack for mimicry and physical comedy. In this one, Carter inadvertently swaps bodies with certain of the Astraeus crew (this is very awkward for those keeping deep, dark secrets). In maybe the series' most rewarding episode for fans of the Sheriff, \"Smarter Carter\" has Allison's highly critical genius brother dropping in for a visit just as Carter's I.Q. inexplicably expands (but at the cost of his humanity). It's so much fun to watch Carter spit out the multi-syllabic, hi-tech jargon. \"Mirror, Mirror\" and \"Double Take\" serve as the action-packed climax to the season-long Astraeus arc. In the farewell episode, \"Just Another Day,\" the DoD shuts down the Eureka project even as the town is rocked by unstable wormholes. Or, as the residents call it: Tuesday.I had such a fun visit in this town. And here I thought the Pacific Northwest was dull. And I think I'll hold Erica Cerra to her parting words in the DVD's bonus segment: \"We'll come back. A movie! I don't know!\"EUREKA Season 5 comes with 3 discs and offers these bonus features:- Holiday Ep \"Do You see What I See?\"- Deleted/Extended Scenes for 6 episodes- Gag Reel (00:02:50 minutes)- Anatomy of an Episode: \"Jack of All Trades\" - a behind-the-scenes look at the body swapping episode (00:17:04 minutes)- \"Ode to Carl the Jeep\" - clips featuring Sheriff Carter's work vehicle getting beat up (00:02:40 minutes)- \"This Song Is on the House\" - Tally Deushane on the ukelele singing about SARAH and Deputy Andy's A.I. romance (00:04:11 minutes)- \"A Fond Farewell\" - the cast and crew say thanks and goodbye (00:03:29 minutes)- Audio Commentary on \"Just Another Day...\" with co-creator/exec. producer Jaime Paglia and exec. producers Bruce Miller and Todd Sharp (in which we learn the plot trajectory of what would've been Season 6)"
B007QRER4K This show had everything:  Drama, comedy, mystery.  It was fun, exciting and just plain excellent.  It was a standout among all the garbage being put out on television.  Sad to see it go....Now pass the tissue please!  :-("
B007QRER4K Awesome trailer, awesome show.It's the last season so don't miss an episode or you'll regret it.It's sad that it's the last season but it should be a great one."
B007QRER4K C'mon. Someone ran out of material. Timelines? Who gets back? Why don't they want to go back? What happens to the beings they replace?"
B007QRER4K Have not received my dvd yet, should arrive soon. I am so sad that this show is ended. I think my favorite episode of this season is when Fargo and Zane go into space. I disliked the \"fireball\" episode, it was extra stupid. One more episode to go this Monday. Sigh. I don't much care for the evil clones reprising the virtual world either. Been there, done that earlier in the season. What I liked about the show was the bewilderment of overly technical science and the interaction of the main characters with their quips and snipes, and the sheriff in his everpresent uniform saves the day with common sense. Unreal? Sure. That's entertainment."
B007QRER4K I never watched Eureka while it was on TV so Ive spent the last few weeks binge watching and now I'm wondering why I wasn't watching it when it was on the air. Overall its a pretty good show, but having watched it all in a short amount of time has given me a little perspective too. I felt like the show was least interesting during the last part of season 2 and most of season 3, with a pretty good rebound for 4 and 5. I also enjoyed watching the show get a little more serious towards the end and wish it had more of that throughout the series. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief a bit when it comes to the science and how Eureka manages to practically blow up the earth every episode, but its fun to watch. The end of the series was also one of the best that Ive seen for many tv shows out there and think they did a great job connecting the beginning and end of the series. I love the characters in the show and think they all did a great job playing their parts and working well together. Nathan Stark was a good character that I was sad to see leave and I really liked seeing Fargo go from being annoying to really being pretty bad ass at the end. The one real issue I had with the series was the Carter/Allison relationship just didn't work for me. Early in the series I could see it, but once she went back to Nathan Stark I disliked ever seeing them together. It really felt like Carter should have ended up with Tess or even Lupo more than Allison, but again, that's a storyline that goes back to the beginning of the show so we all knew it was probably going to end the way it did even if the show evolved to the point it probably shouldn't have happened. Overall Eureka is really fun to watch and worth seeing if you havent already."
B007QRER4K As this was the last season of the series I was expecting the writing to be a lower caliber than the rest of the seasons. it was not. I liked the way they wraped it up."
B007QRER4K I now have the entire series of this program, now I dont have to wait for reruns to enjoy the perils and pitfalls of this fun town and all the characters involved"
B007QRER4K Season 5 (2012)On August 17, 2010, Syfy announced that there will be a fifth and final season.[1] On August 8, 2011, it was announced that season 5 will be the final season;[3] it was later announced that the network has ordered an additional episode for season 5 to wrap up the series. On February 16, 2012, Syfy announced that the show's fifth and final season would premiere on April 16, 2012. A case was made to Syfy that this would leave a lot of story lines open and would really not give the fans closure.  On that basis one additional episode of the fifth season was ordered, which aired on July 16, 2012.This is a three disk set containing 13 episodes and Special featuresSpecial Features:Holiday Episode: Do You See What I See?Gag ReelDeleted and Extended ScenesAnatomy of an Episode: Jack of All TradesOde to Carl the Jeep&#8220;This Song Is on the House&#8221;A Fond FarewellJust Another Day&#8230;: Episode Commentarywith Co-Creator/Executive Producer Jaime Paglia and Executive Producers Bruce Miller and Todd SharpOn a personal note.  I think the Christmas special may be the best episode ever.  After watching it I really began to cheer for Carl the Jeep.  Also the combination of special effects was truly hilarious to watch.  This was an over the top laugh fest which did not disappoint.  If you&#8217;re a fan of the series this special is worth purchasing all by itself."
B007QRER4K This was a classic body switching comedy with a lot of sex jokes thrown in. Plus, you get to see all the hot cast members practically naked. What else could you possibly ask for from one of the smartest comedies out there."
B007QRER4K We are so bummed like many others that this was the last season of the show. We all hope they will create a Season 6 and beyond!"
B007QRER4K what a shame they discontinued such a unique show.  always looked forward to the next episode."
B007QRER4K I got into Eureka when I was bored and thought the pilot was pretty cheesy. I never finished watching the pilot (though I thought I had) but jumped right into season 1, which surprised me by being both funny and profound. Unlike many American shows, these writers were righteous enough to wrap up their show without waiting for ratings to tank and the ending was perfectly conclusive. There were only a couple of story lines that I felt could have been more adequately attacked, but I felt satisfied.This show isn't for everyone. If you're a science-y person who can't suspend disbelief when watching sci-fi, don't watch this. I sincerely doubt most of the SCIENCE! they use is plausible. If you're a happy-ending person, this is for you because nearly every episode wraps up the outstanding issue with a few notable exceptions. This show explores the moral dilemmas that have always faced scientists, but none so much as using technology to help mankind versus using technology for war. Loved the cast, loved the plot, glad I watched it."
B007QRER4K Wish it was back.  Don't know why they always cancel the good shows. Get rid of all those reality shows and bring back real tv.Awesome show!"
B007QRER4K Season five meant the end of Eureka on television and the town and the characters will be missed. Thank goodness I have the entire series on DVDs. I look forward to watching the episodes and reliving the charm and chaos in this quaint little town."
B007QRER4K Rather than try to review each season separately I would say that as a sci-fi fan I enjoyed the series immensely and am very, very sorry that whoever, SyFy or NBC,  cancelled the series.  However, Jaime Paglia did leave it open-ended and altho Government support has left, the good doctor jumped in and bought the town so Eureka lives on (altho only in our hearts.)  I live in hope that someone with more money will pick up the show.  It was a solid, intelligent, scientific show with a great deal of humor and a certain amount of emotional turmoil, even from the robots!  Will miss it greatly.Linda Sheean"
B007QRER4K The final season, was a little sad to find out this was the last season, episodes series.  They had a good run, wonder if they will make a special mini series."
B007QRER4K One of the best written TV shows ever. Highly underrated and quietly a gem. Strong acting, strong writing, pretty good editing to the end."
B007QRER4K Good clean prime time ready for all the family fun.  I love the characters and the crazy science.  I just wish they could have kept the show around for more seasons."
B007QRER4K Perfect blend of comedy and drama in a Sci-Fy show. After watching all the Deleted scenes and Outakes, we put in Season 1 and started all over again."
B007QRER4K It was a dang shame they took this show off the air.  It was really well done.  I miss it a lot!!"
B007QRER4K my husband and i have really enjoyed this series wish it hadn't have been ended and i rewatch all seasons as i can"
B007QRER4K I enjoyed this series.  Didn't really want it to end but all good things must.  Worth watching if you like comedy with a slight sy-fy twist."
B007QRER4K THIS IS SAD TO ME. I ENJOYED GOING TO EUREKA. IS A GREAT WAY TO END THE SERIES. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS AS WELL. GOOD BYE EUREKA"
B007QRER4K The perfect ending for this zany series.wraps up every single character and five years of storyline in this last season"
B007QRER4K While it is a bit mindless at times, the characters are likable and the stories at pleasant. Occassionally they went a little over the top with stuff, but I recommend it to anyone who likes their Sci Fi more on the tame side, with a hefty dose of wit and satire."
B007QRER4K Quirky, dramatic and funny, the episodes tie off all the extended plot lines from prior seasons.  Mostly that works and make good entertainment."
B007QRER4K This was a series with a different twist.  If you like syfi this will be fun to watch!  See it from the beginning!"
B007QRER4K I love this entire series  - the primise as well as the characters. I am over 50 but love science so was into it although I see the show as better fit for teens. A positive and entertaining message."
B007QRER4K This is a great tv shows I love it, sorry it when off the air. If you like science fiction you will like this program."
B007QRER4K I really enjoyed Eureka, Season 5. I liked how they ended the show with a good sense of closure and a nod to the way the show started."
B007QRER4K Eureka is the perfect show for the entire family.My son and I love it and thanks to Amazon Prime we are able to watch the entire series from beginning to end as often as we'd like.Eureka is the #1 show Syfy has ever aired and it is an absolute shame they decided to cancel it. My son and I are still hoping Syfy comes to their senses and starts filling this great show again."
B007QRER4K Great show. Will miss it."
B007QRER4K I am so sad that this series has ended, it really was the thinking persons series, I do hope another network picks it up as it ended in a way that it could return any time, loved the Christmas episode, half cartoon, anime and real life, I realize that it is an expensive show to create as the quality is high, both in acting and the special effects, almost movie quality, sad days."
B007QRER4K Not as much as former seasons, season 5 is dark. My husband and I enjoyed the goofy-ness of the former seasons and lightheartedness. Killing off one of the main characters and then trying to bring them back to life in another body form- crosses some moral boundaries. Anyhow, loved the series - always a big syfy fan but Eureka was about a community of people who loved each other and committed to each other."
B007QRER4K So want to cry.  Love the show from all the way from the first season.  Sadly it had to end.  Still great season."
B007QRER4K I wonder what awesome top secret project Holly and Doug have been recruited for. Lots of traveling... please tell me she is going to be a starship captain. A follow-up to the Astreaus mission? A spinoff perhaps? :D"
B007QRER4K So many great lines, physical comedy and plain ol' fun in this episode that kept the action, drama and comedy in good balance.  Eureka is one of the best examples of a show that manages to be diverse, witty and funny without ever stooping to low blows.  It's sweet, charming and this episode highlights how great the writers and producers are at making sure every character is rich, well developed and integral to each episode; there are no throwaway characters on Eureka."
B007QRER4K Great Sifi show, a mix of comedy, science, and action. Always an interesting show. What the future may bring. Wished for a next season."
B007QRER4K i really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. it seems like the cast  lost interest in season 5,the scripts were very bad."
B007QRJRAY This was really disappointing.  As a long time Spiderman fan this show comes off as silly, and targeted at the youngest of children."
B007QRJRAY \"Exclusive\" is probably the best Ultimate Spider-Man episode so far. It's still not up to the standard of \"Spectacular Spider-Man\", but it's a massive improvement. Unfortunately, I don't think this signals the start of better quality for the series as a whole. \"Exclusive\" was good because it was outside the mold of the rest of the episodes. No psychedelic cut-aways into Peter's hyperactive brain. Not too many lame jokes. Only one brief glimpse of Peter's \"team\" in what was probably the most irritating scene of the entire episode. But there's nothing to suggest that these elements aren't going to be back in full force for the rest of the season, and they are what's ruining the show. For me, \"Exclusive\" is sign that Ultimate Spider-Man COULD be excellent. It may take a whole season of disgruntled fans shouting abuse for the writers to figure that out and get to work on fixing this mess."
B007QRJRAY With so much hype and talent on board, I was hoping for a much better product.  Spectacular Spider-man was great and way too short...I am still watching them every few months.  Ultimate Spider-man has too many different styles, and too much story jammed in this, to makes it any fun.  Shield, highschool, electric webs?  a spider-cycle...c'mon!  The greatest hero in the world swings around NYC not rides a motorcycle!  Some of the fights have been good, but the quiet story parts are uninteresting.  Marvel please look at Young Justice to see how a good cartoon is made or bring back Spectacular Spider-man.  Spidey deserves a good cartoon....please, please, please...."
B007QRJRAY and spiderman uses it like a toy and that's even the name of the episode like a toy..love to be able to watching it for free on Netflix, but very disappointed that I had to pay to watch it on amazon when I can watch it for free on Netflix, thanks again amazon for being to tricky sneaky and cheap"
B007QRJRAY My son loves this show, and i have to admit i do too. It is a departure from the dark and some whhat depressing versions of spiderman  we are used to seeing. I love how funny the show is and i find myself laughing a lot."
B007QRJRAY I am a huge fan of several principal Marvel characters, and have spent several years collecting the animated and live action versions of characters I enjoy. I was especially interested in the Ultimate Spiderman cartoon, as it seemed like more than just another take on everyone's favorite webslinger. I can honestly say the show is entertaining -- downright laugh out loud funny at times -- and that is pretty exceptional for a cartoon! I am glad I bought the season and can say without a doubt that of all of the Spiderman series I own, this one is by far the most entertaining for me -- and my kids. They really did a good job this time!"
B007QRJRAY I bought this then realized it was streaming as part of my net flix subscription,  So compare 29.99 to 7.99."
B007QRJV0K My boys still love their Avenger shows....so this one is great for car rides to our family's house and for quiet time."
B007QRJV0K Loved season 1 and loved season 2 even more. I hope to see a season three very soon! Ant-Man! I need more Ant-Man in this!"
B007QRJV0K I love this series and am a big fan but.....Giant robots???  Seriously???  All the other episodes are outstanding but this one is pathetic."
B007QRJV0K I love this show and am bitterly disappointed it was canceled before it really got going. The writers handed the twisting story lines expertly and made sure to give all the Avengers enough face time to make the viewers care about each one of them. This show has a really good Loki too which is very hard to do and currently only this show and the Avenger's movie have managed to pull off.This show is a must watch for kids and adults."
B007QRJV0K Fun to watch!  It shows how important a team like the Avengers would be.  Love the character interaction and the fight scences.  Good job marvel.  Lets get some more shows like this on."
B007QRJV0K As far as superhero action series go this isn't bad.  They stay fairly true to the characters and even parallel the actual comics books for the most part.  My kids enjoy this and the older X-men series."
B007QRJV0K When Michael Korvac, a half-naked man with weird scars on his back is brought to Avengers Mansion The Wasp (fresh from being dumped by Ant-Man) develops an attachment to the mysterious Korvac.Michael claims he was abducted and tortured by Aliens until he escaped. The story seems unbelievable until a group of Aliens arrive. After a short battle The Avengers meet \"The Guardians of the Galaxy\" a group of Heroes who protect all sentient species in the Galaxy. They are led by Star-Lord, a human named Peter Quill. Korvak is actually a mass murderer responsible for the deaths of countless people, his powers a byproduct of an artificially activated X-Gene.The Avengers and Guardians team up to bring down the now Berserking Korvac"
B007QRJV0K Me and my 7-year-old both love it!  (But why did they have to change the song to a voiceover, c'mon).  Of course, a month after I bought the last episode in season 2, it became available on netflicks....grumble....but that's more a gripe about amazon than this series.  Watch the hell out of it on netflicks!"
B007QRJV0K SPOILERS WARNING!!!--------------------The series started out good. It picks up exactly where it left off from season 1, where they introduced the the first sign of Skrulls are on the Earth trying to take over. The Skrulls still hiding themselves from most people knowledge and are slowly replacing every hero on Earth, one by one. But at the same time the Avengers learn that the Skrulls are on Earth trying to do that. The heroes don't know exactly who is a Skrull and who isn't until it's too late.  But one hero actually did find a way to identify Skrulls, but it's was too. Then, the final battle(s) for the ending of the first half of the series.The first half of the series got me interested in the season and it was great seeing NEW heroes and villains. If you recently played Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 (UMVC3) than you would most likely know the new people in this series. It seems like the writers used UMVC3 as their selection list of new people to have in the series. It's fine with me because I like the game and the people in it.The second half of the series seemed to rotate around fighting the Kree invasion from Earth. But before all that stuff happens, they seemed to have many filler shows that are used to gain more and more Part Time Avenger Members. By doing this, it didn't seem like the second half of the series was as well made as the first half. I felt a little disconnection from the main plot and point of it.In the second half of the series for some reason people won't see the Hulk. He is there, but for like 2 shows out of 14. The time he is there, he barely did anything. He just seemed to disappeared from the whole series after he was free from capture. Now, you would think he would be in the show even more afterwards, however, he's not! For some reason, he seemed to want to become just a part time member.I heard they won't be a 3rd season, so it seemed like the last show of the second series was to end the whole Avenger series for good. The last show could had been like a whole season by itself, but they manage to do it in 1 show. I feel like they could had stretch out the story telling exactly like how they did it for the first half of the second season. Just as they did it for ending the first season, show the next villain and end it at that. But instead, they showed the villain for the 3rd season, but also took care of him too. It really doesn't make sense since he's not a regular old villain at all. But, I guess, since there's no more plans on future Avengers episodes, there was no choice otherwise.Maybe it for the bests. The Avenger second half got pretty bad and the story was thin and at the end got kind of boring.And, if this show was actually so good, why would they cancel it then? Because it's not that good, and it will be canceled!"
B007QRJV0K Very happy with this season -- and with the purcha
B007QRJV0K This one I'm going to keep short and sweet.Almost everything I raved about in my review of season one applies equally to season two. The art continues to be extremely stylish, and to preserve that ever so slightly \"gritty\" comic book feel that we rarely get to see in animation. On the level of the individual episodes, the storytelling is action packed, lightning paced, and riveting. The season-spanning story arcs are cleverly put together and emotionally engaging. Indeed, I should really say \"series-spanning\", because the continuity here is seamless: much of what we see in season two flows on directly from season one.The bottom line is that this is a great show that both children and adults can enjoy. It's smart, but accessible. It may not deconstruct its own genre in the way thatWatchmenorJustice League Unlimiteddid. But it does give us both characters and a universe of genuine depth and complexity. One of the many things I love about this show is that very occasionally, it does dip its toe in the waters of the broader Marvel Universe. Just as in season one we had a couple of members of the Fantastic Four show up for poker night, this time around we get a team-up with everyone's favorite hometown hero, Spider-Man. Not just the kind of team-up that simply means that there's an extra guy in spandex to punch the baddies, either. All the classic Spider-Man braggadocio and angst come along for the ride.So yes, as superhero cartoons go, this is one of the great ones.About the only down side worth mentioning is that they've spoiled the rather stylish season one opening titles by overlaying an extremely cheesy voice over, consisting of a kind of micro-bio of the team as a whole, and of a few of the main characters (e.g. \"The Hulk! Strongest hero there is!\").That, and the fact that this, the second season, is also apparently the last.Why, Marvel?Why???Theo."
B007QYRCX6 Avatar The Last Airbender was an amazing and critically acclaimed series, and the Legends of Korra, it's sequel, has big boots to fill.  Fortunately Korra is up to the task.This series keeps the basic setting of the Avatar series, and fans of the original will quickly adapt.  However, Korra has a vastly different tone and feel to it, enough to set itself apart without alienating the existing fan base.  It is not an easy task to accomplish, but the writers and producers have managed it perfectly here.Where Airbender was set in a very mystical East Asian type setting, Korra has a very steampunk feel.  Technology begins making an appearance, and even the dress and mannerisms of the characters reflect this change.  At the same time, the setting of the original series, completely with spirits and mysticism, remains intact.Overall Korra has a much darker tone to it than Airbender did.  Enemies are scarier, situations are more tense, and you actually fear for the characters.  It is a logical progression assuming that the age group that airbender targeted has aged since the premier of the original series.  The show is still perfectly fine for kids,  but teenagers and adults will find more drama and tension than before.  Arguments and politics are never presented with a winning or losing side, always leaving the decision of who is right or wrong up the viewer.Overall this is one of the best and smartest shows on television right now, enjoyable for people of all ages, and I highly recommend it to fans of the original series and newcomers alike."
B007QYRCX6 This is another of those rare series I can put up for the kids with relatively little worry. The storyline is good enough to keep me entertained and the kids love it though they don't &#34;get&#34; it all yet."
B007QYRCX6 There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review. If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn't follow along with the masses, then don't read this. There are other reviews better suited to you. DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is. If you want that, then I strongly recommend you go there. Heck, Shinashi didn't even write a review of the first episode, but she felt so strongly about it that she'll attack total strangers to defend it. I guess if you judge a thing by the company it keeps, then let your eyes be the judge and read on.Just to warn you, if you read this you will probably hate me for it. You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am. Likely, you will want to pick apart every word of my review. It may be an attempt to mirror how \"harsh\" one person called this review, or how \"brutal\" another dubbed its author. At this point, I don't even care*. I wrote this to offer another opinion besides the hyperbole being showered upon this episode.Finally, this review is for this episode only. I have watched no other episode in the series. This episode was bad enough that I could not follow it any further. I'm sure you'll want to attack me for that too.I am not writing this to attack or offend anyone... except maybe TLOK. If you feel like my perspective is faulty, ignorant, or just plain belligerent, I don't care*. If you don't even care what I have to say, but want to bash ME for making the comment, I don't care*. If you are a parent just looking for a show for your kids to watch, eh, this will keep them entertained. It has lights and motion. Lots of bells and whistles. It's either this or the Backyardigans (although I think the latter is better conceived). Pick your poison.*When I say I don't care, I don't mean that I don't think other opinions are valid. I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, \"necessity is the mother of invention\". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire \"Facebook Developers\" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand \"likes\" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, \"like\" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don't let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell."
B007QYRCX6 This is a good, though somewhat short, series.  Great follow-through from the original Avatar series.  The steampunk background is quite engaging.  My 10 year-old son loves it, almost as much as the first Avatar series.  Would recommend."
B007QYRCX6 I liked Legend of Korra.  It reminded me of old superman movies which I loved as a child; and this one was a school, how to get from there to being a Legend.  I think it was great!  Thank you for offering this movie."
B007QYRCX6 The Hundred Year War ended when Avatar Aang defeated the Fire Lord Ozai and brought peace to the Four Nations. Aang and Ozai's son, Zuko, founded the United Republic of Nations where people from all over the world could live together in peace. Its capital, Republic City, became a beacon of hope and integration for all of humanity.Seventy years on from the end of the war, Korra, the new Avatar, arrives in Republic City to begin learning the art of airbending from Tenzin, Aang and Katara's son. Born and raised in the Southern Water Tribe, Korra is initially overwhelmed by the bright lights and perceived glamour of the city. But there are inequalities and simmering tensions in the city, stoked by the enigmatic Amon who desires a world where magic-benders no longer exist. When he reveals that he has the power to strip a person's abilities from them, he becomes the biggest threat the city has ever seen...a threat that only the Avatar can defeat.The Legend of Korra is the sequel series to Avatar: The Last Airbender, arguably the greatest slice of western animation of the past twenty years. The task of crafting a sequel to such a beloved show was daunting, but the producers have risen to the occasion by doing the only thing they could: take the sequel in a very different direction from the original series.Whilst Avatar was more of a traditional adventure story featuring Aang and his adventures travelling from place to place, Korra is much more locked into the location of Republic City. Heavily influenced by both New York and Shanghai in the 1920s, Republic City takes influences from history, retrofuturism and steampunk. It's a towering collection of skyscrapers, sporting arenas, industrial parks and cars (sorry, 'Satomobiles') where fortunes can be made and lost overnight. It's clearly the same world as seen in Avatar, but the technology we saw beginning to develop in that series (such as airships and steam vessels) has moved forwards dramatically. The show makes use of these stylings in various ways, from the 1920s-influenced soundtrack to the cinema news reel which plays at the start of each episode and acts as a recap of the story so far.  Moving away from the setting of the original series was a clever idea and provides not just a great backdrop for the new series, but also (via flashback) brief opportunities to see the later adventures of Aang and his friends as they built up this society from scratch.The setting is beautifully-depicted, but characterisation is a more mixed bag. Korra is a sympathetic and winning heroine, even if she does settle into the 'brash and headstrong teenager' trope a little too easily. Mako and Bolin, the pro-bending brothers who become Korra's key allies, are more standard archetypes: the square-jawed hero and his wise-cracking sidekick. The non-bending member of the 'new Team Avatar', Asami Sato, may be the most interesting character of the bunch but she gets relatively little development compared to the others. The supporting cast is better-handled. Tenzin is a stoic, serious man clearly overburdened by the weight of his late father's expectations but who opens up a little to Korra. His kids are played for comic relief, but provide quite a few excellent laughs as the series progresses. Another key supporting character is Lin Beifong, Toph's daughter and the city's chief of police, who starts off being thoroughly unlikable but grows into a more relatable character over the course of the season. The enigmatic Amon, with his smoothly threatening voice and blank-faced mask, is also an effective villain.As with Avatar, the show can be watched and enjoyed by kids and adults on different levels. Kids will likely respond to the action-focused storylines and cute animal characters, whilst adults will likely appreciate the allusions (and even satire) to our own history and society. The inequalities in the setting, based on both the growth of capitalism and the fact that benders are almost able always to get jobs whilst non-benders suffer (fuelling Amon's revolution), are tackled head-on in a surprisingly mature way for a kid's show. However, the socio-economic tensions emerge organically from the setting and its development from the original series rather then being developed too incongruously. This extends to magic as well, with the new forms of bending discovered towards the end of the original show (metalbending and energybending) both playing key new roles in this series and being developed logically.The show suffers a little from being restricted to just 12 episodes in its first season (compared to Avatar's 20 episodes per season). Story arcs that the viewer might have expected to last a bit longer are compressed into just an episode or two, and sometimes the pacing feels off. This lack of time also means that some elements - such as the size of Amon's forces and the firepower available to it - feel a little unconvincing. More damaging is the decision to base the season's main emotional arc around a love triangle between Mako, Asami and Korra. With more time to develop, this could have made for a more effective background element (much as how romance was handled in the original series), but here it's much more front-and-centre and dominates two episodes to their detriment. The limited screentime also means some characters (like General Iroh, Zuko's grandson who amusingly shares his grandfather's voice actor) aren't really fleshed out at all and just show up, do some stuff and disappear without much being learned about them.Still, the flipside of the fewer episodes means that there's less hanging about and each episode feels busier, developing multiple storylines in tandem as well as building up the setting and the backdrop. It could all have exploded into an incoherent mess, but the writers manage the chaos quite well.Despite some flaws, The Legend of Korra - Book I: Air (****) is a worthy follow-up to Avatar: The Last Airbender. It tries to be different whilst also exploring the consequences of the preceding series and manages to pull both off. The characters aren't quite a match for their predecessors, but this remains a highly watchable and engaging animated series. It is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA). Book II: Spirit will be released in 2014."
B007QYRCX6 Although I cannot say that I like it as much as the Last Airbender, it is still a five-starer.... We are all enjoying watching this as a family.  Each night one of us will say, 'let's watch just one more'...... You really enjoy the characters.  Good, clean fun entertainment."
B007QYRCX6 My daughter convinced me to watch The Last Airbender series, and it was truly a great story. Those who enjoyed The Last Airbender probably wish the TLOK was a direct continuation of that series, but it is not. TLOK is a good series on its own and I think we all wish it answered some of the deep questions we have about Ang and the other key characrters. Hopefully, Nickolodeon will see that there is room for a continuation of the The Last Airbender series, which is what most of us are looking for I think."
B007QYRCX6 My daughter likes to watch cartoons, but many of them are so violent and show how to be disrespectful to others.  many of them hark back to RoadRunner/Wiley Coyote  days..where the protagonist just keeps on trying to kill the character...using various methods.This series is an amazing relief from those animated series.  The plot is intriguing and the characters believable.  The animation is very good, although not on par with Disney...I don't care about that part.  My 9-year-old daughter loves this series and I make sure I watch it with her.  And I enjoy it, too!"
B007QYRCX6 I just started this season.  I'm only a couple of episodes in.  I do enjoy the show...(but it is important to remember that it's not quite Avatar!)"
B007QYRCX6 It was a nice production and a good attempt at connecting the stories without making it a sequel.....i do feel they were rushed in the storyline to get it out there.....i dont know if they felt they were getting a second season..... I feel they would have developed the characters and storyline a lot more......"
B007QYRCX6 I wasn't sure I was gonna like this because I was such a huge fan of Avatar the Last Airbender and I wasn't sure how to feel about different characters.  The first episode actually didn't interest me at all, but I kept watching and it grew on me.  I gotta say I do really like where they are trying to go with the new series.  Pleasantly surprised me."
B007QYRCX6 The Legend of the Avatar continues with this 2nd Series, and a plucky new avatar, Korra hence the series name. Well worth the watch for fans of the original series now all grown up :P"
B007QYRCX6 Korra may be the Avatar, but she is not Aang. She is actually quite the opposite of an Air-Bender, and she's not nearly as peaceful when it comes to resolving domestic issues. But that's part of her character, and it's a reason why Korra is fun to watch. She starts of a bending prodigy with only one element to learn how to bend. It takes an extremely comprising position, but she figures AirBending out. With the help of Aang, the previous Avatar, Korra is on her way to becoming the next Avatar, and she is to become the world's next savior."
B007QYRCX6 My daughter and I enjoyed watching the &#34;Last Air Bender&#34; series togther and were excited to see this new spin-off. We watched all these together and enjoyed them just as well. This story line is more of an older teen style but was clean good vs evil adventures."
B007QYRCX6 - Korra, seriously sleepy and railing against her morning regimen: \"What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?\" (voice drops to a whisper) \"The morning is eeeeevil.\"So I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon show. When you mention AVATAR I think of giant blue aliens. And, to me, airbending is what you do when you've had too many spicy chimichangas. Except that I saw THE LEGEND OF KORRA on Nickelodeon and was impressed enough that I'm now incentivized to touch base with the source material.AVATAR:THE LAST AIRBENDER was oriented towards a wandering heroes theme, something which THE LEGEND OF KORRA eschews. Our protagonist has it over Avatar Aang by some years, and so I understand that, in comparison, the storytelling is darker and more ambitious. Some seventy years after Avatar Aang's turbulent era, here's Korra, an impulsive teenager, being projected as the next Avatar, except that Korra can only bend three of the four elements. Seeking mastery over that elusive fourth element, determined to learn airbending, she leaves her training outpost in the South Pole and journeys to Republic City to train under the stern airbending master, Tenzin, who happens to be Avatar Aang's youngest child, now grown to middle-age adulthood. Korra brings along her wicked awesome polar bear dog, Naga, who is so awesome I'm compelled to use the word \"awesome\" three times in a sentence.In Republic City Korra is initially regarded as a rube, a rustic, but she's adventurous and high-spirited and so confident. As her frustration at her inability to airbend grows, her notoriety as the Avatar exposes her to public scrutiny and to the twisty politics of Republic City. She becomes aware of the increasing anti-bending sentiment harbored by the non-bending populace. She finds solace in competing in the hotly contested pro-bending sports league. Imagine the hubbub when it's outed that the current incarnation of the Avatar is one-third of the Fire Ferrets. They've just qualified for the playoffs.Meanwhile, looming over everything is the malevolent presence of Amon, the shadowy figure that leads the anti-bending movement calling itself the Equalists. A non-bender (and proud of it), Amon uses his ability to strip away others' bending skills to inspire the Equalists and to foment a violent revolution. He wants to reshape the world. He sets his eyes on Korra. He's a fantastic villain, even if the show does play dirty pool with regards to his true identity.\"Book One: Air\" presents this series' marvelous first twelve episodes. Week after week, these episodes keep on topping each other. I couldn't believe how good it was. I dig the backdrop, Eastern mysticism hand in hand with western innovation, a rich blend of the medieval and the progressive. Seventy years had elapsed from Aang's own series, enough time for the way of life to evolve from feudalism to something resembling industrial Shanghai circa 1920s. I love those touches, the vintage automobiles, that voice on the radio that just reminds you of the flapper era. The animation is so visually striking and gets only more dynamic when Korra and her friends spring into action. And, yes, Korra makes friends and, in fact, goes on to form an informal posse that engages in bouts of vigilante justice throughout Republic City.The action sequences are so boss and made even more epic by the presence of metal benders and blood benders and sinister chi-blockers, as well as the more traditional benders. I love that Korra fights with reckless abandon. I really like her character's arc, her growth as a person. I also became fond of Tenzin, Bo Lin, Asami Sato and the stoic Police Chief Lin Beifong. Seeing Beifong and Tenzin unleashed planted a big grin on my mug. That grin only got wider when Tenzin's adorable little kids get in on the act (that young boy is a riot).Did I even mention how funny this show is?Even if there were no more LEGEND OF KORRA episodes after this, I'm satisfied. This is an arc rich in plot development. It's constructed with a definite beginning, middle, and end in mind, and I can't recommend it enough. If there are any naysayers, it's those who demand even stronger ties between THE LEGEND OF KORRA and its predecessor, never mind that Easter eggs pepper the episodes. It's a good thing I don't have blood-bending talents. However, I'm down with those who say that the narrative could do without the cheesy teen romance bits. Mako kind of ticks me off. I can't wait for the next season, or is it the second half of Season One?The DVD set comes with 2 discs. The bonus stuff goes like so:- \"The Legend of Puppetbender Presents: The Making of a Legend: The Untold Story, Part I\" - spoofy interviews with a fake LEGEND OF KORRA cast... as puppets (00:06:00 minutes)- Audio Commentary by Creators, Cast & Crew on 4 episodes: \"Welcome to Republic City\" (with creators/exec. producers Mike Dimartino and Bryan Konietzko and Janet Varney who voices \"Korra\"), \"A Leaf in the Wind\" (Dimartino, Konietzko, Janet Varney and David Faustino who voices \"Mako\"), \"Skeletons in the Closet (Dimartino, Konietzko, and composers/sound designers Ben Wynn and Jeremy Zuckerman), and \"Endgame\" (Dimartino, Konietzko, co-exec. producer Joaquim Dos Santos and Steve Blum who voices \"Amon\")"
B007QYRCX6 I was a little skeptical about The Legend of Korra, but as a fan of the first, I couldn't resist to watch.  I initially thought it started slowly, but perhaps that was with my skeptical eyes wanting it to not be as good as Team Ang.  Nonetheless, I was hooked and, more importantly, impressed.  The writers/creators have somehow managed to use the same charm as the first one -- through its excellent writing, humor, and nice animation (even better).  I also feel it's a little more grown-up, which is great because it recognizes that its original fan base has also grown up, making it very relevant.  The last few episodes were epic.  I need to re-watch the last one ... right now!"
B007QYRCX6 It took me a few episodes to get into it and get over the fact that all of the characters I  liked from avatar were the history of these characters"
B007QYRCX6 Although not as deep as the original , it is still very entertaining. The original had more growth to the character development as Aang had to learn the other elements, this one skipped that process. More action oriented, due to the shorter season."
B007QYRCX6 If you like the Avatar, you will likely like this. I would recommend the avatar first though, as you don't get much of a background to &#34;bending&#34; in this production. Done well and great stories. We like the characters, voices and animation."
B007QYRCX6 The different books in this one are complete stories, both so far interesting and well done. I love the cultural fusions and well rounded characters. Definitely a must for any Avatar fans."
B007QYRCX6 This show is not bad and a decent follow up to The Avatar. They just don't have quite the same impact that the originals did. Not sure I like the timeline advance."
B007QYRCX6 This brings back a lot of the beloved feeling of the original series, while still introducing enough new to make it interesting. Very funny, and if you liked the originaly, I suggest setting aside some time to view this one too!"
B007QYRCX6 I never really liked Anime but the storyline of the avatar is very spiritual and moving. This second installment to the last Airbender isn't as good as the last Airbender but definitely noteworthy and worth watching I believe the writers did a great job making this show and I hope they continue to add to it."
B007QYRCX6 I can't wait until season 2.  If you like the original avatar you would definitely like this one.  Characters are really developing."
B007QYRCX6 This series is the sequel to the animated series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender.\"  You can understand this series well enough without having seen \"Avatar\" first.  In this fantasy world, certain people have magical control over one of the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, or Water.  The world was split into four kingdoms:  Firebenders rule the Fire Nation, Waterbenders rule the Water Nation, and so on.  In the previous series, the Fire Nation attempted to take over the world, but Aang, the last Airbender, stopped them.  Only one person can control all four elements - this is the Avatar who, upon death, reincarnates yet again as the Avatar.Teenage Korra is the new Avatar.  Since the Fire Nation was defeated, there has been peace.  Technology has advanced to around the 1920's of our world, with electricity, automobiles, blimps, biplanes, radios, and so forth (dieselpunk.)  Korra has already mastered three of the elements but ironically can't airbend at all.  She wants to learn from Aang's son Tenzin, who eventually agrees to teach her.  A new threat is arising - the Equalists, led by a masked man calling himself Amon, who has the ability to take away people's bending powers.  Can Korra learn how to airbend, fully become the Avatar, defeat Amon, and figure out which young man she likes?  Watch and see.Does anime have to be made in Japan?  I don't think so.  This is one of the better anime out there.  It's more intense than \"Avatar,\" which was aimed more at younger viewers.  The animation quality of \"Korra\" is better, and the CGI and cell drawings merge well.  The voice acting is mostly pretty good."
B007QYRCX6 Korra should be an interesting character to follow in the new Avatar series from Nickelodeon. This animated series is poised to be as big a hit as the original and there are some CGI elements that have already surfaced in the premiere episode. The visuals are astounding as well as the fight coordination and I expect that the lessons that the avatar will learn along her path will be good life lessons and keeping with the tradition of the original show. We'll have to see how the new world of the avatar pans out as it is set in Republic city (at least to start) which seems to follow a 1910's technology with air-ships and automobiles of the era with high-rise buildings like those of New York at the turn of the century. So, time will tell, but so far, it looks promising and I am eager to see more."
B007QYRCX6 The Legend of Korra is an okay sequel to the Avatar.  It starts out a little slow but later episodes start to get better.  The animation is great and like the original Avatar the characters are written with depth if not sometimes a little too silly.  I hope the series continues to get better with time and became a true classic like its predessor."
B007QYRCX6 Korra is a fast paced, excellently written animated series for all ages.  I would recommend it for anyone's video library."
B007QYRCX6 As a series that honors its origins without ever being merely imitative of them, this may well turn out to be one of the all time great television spin-offs. Indeed, the very term \"spin-off\" seems somehow inadequate. For this is a true sequel, and one fully up to the task of standing on equal terms with its predecessor.A lifetime has passed between the ending of Avatar and the beginning of Korra, and in that time the world of the four nations has moved on. Even during the scope of the original series, we saw that world in a state of technological ferment. In the time between the two series, this process has clearly marched on unabated. By the time Korra begins, we find ourselves in a world with technology comparable to early 20th century Earth.To those who fell in love with the world of the first series, I'd say only this: don't worry, for there is nothing to fear here. The  writers have not destroyed or replaced their original creation. Rather, they have profoundly deepened it. There is the sense of a real world with its own internal logic and course of development - a world that changes precisely because of its own reality. Integral to this is the fact that it's not just the technology that has moved forwards. Everything from the society's economic basis to its martial arts has changed since last we were here, but always in logical and internally consistent ways. You can tell that this is a show made by people with a deep respect for the integrity of their own creation.As with the original series, this logical and consistent quality - this ability to just plain think things through - applies not only to the world-building, but also to the plot and story. At all times we have the sense of a tapestry being woven. Even when we don't quite know where all the threads are heading, or what dark warp in the weave is yet to surface, we  instinctively know that _something_ is happening. Something we can't help but get caught up in and want to follow.Fittingly for an animated show, the world, the story, and all its many moods are communicated to us in large part through the art. At all times we know we're in the same world we were first introduced to in the original Avatar series. There are no sharp breaks here. However, in keeping with the early 20th century feel of this new era, the coloring is significantly more subdued. On a concrete level this manifests in such details as the sepia hues of early photography and the drabness of industrial landscapes. But it is also used to convey the sense that the world we are visiting is now a murkier place, one where the true nature of the threats faced is significantly less clear than it was in the original series. It is a tempting if imperfect metaphor to cast this show asThe Empire Strikes Backof the Avatar universe.I also find that I cannot let this review go by without mentioning the background music. As with the original series, this is composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, and is once again superb. It is both beautiful in its own right and integral to how the show's creators communicate with us as an audience. It speaks to us of the nature of the world we find ourselves in, of the story we are following, and again, of all the many moods that this story takes. And it not only speaks: it speaks eloquently.There is so much more to say here, but I'm going to cut myself down to two final observations.First, Andrea Romano, whom I shall forever think of asHawkgirl, lends her considerable talents to the voice direction. One never knows quite how much credit should go to a director and how much to the actors. But when everyone just plays off each other perfectly, you've got to figure that a significant slice of the credit should go to the director. Props to you, Andrea.Second, one of the things I've loved the most about this series is how, in the character of Avatar Korra, we do have the sense that at the core, this is the same person we were first introduced to as Avatar Aang: even though that person is now manifesting through a very different personality.This is far and away the best thing Nickelodeon has done in years. It is the kind of show that both children and adults can enjoy. But unlike so many shows that wind up being described in such terms, it is not \"multi-layered\" in the straightforward sense that there are some things that the less sophisticated viewers will miss entirely. Rather, its generation-spanning appeal stems from far more basic strengths: a well thought out story, real emotional depth, and compelling characters; to say nothing of meticulous world-building coupled with wonderfully lyrical art and background music.That, in the end, is why both children and adults will love The Legend of Korra.Theo."
B007QYRCX6 I found myself waiting for Ang to show up to brighten my day.  The whole beauty and artistry of the original was downgraded in this.  It shows that the producers wanted to make a quick buck by tapping into the children's market.  The original Avatar was actually beautifully put together. This is a piece of crap and destroyed most of my feelings about the original characters.  Save your money"
B007QYRCX6 We loved the Air Bender series and was so glad to see you offer this.  We can't wait to see the subsequent seasons."
B007QYRCX6 I really like the show, I haven't yet seen all the episodes but so far it's good.  It doesn't have the same elemental quality of teaching the spiritual fundamentals as in Avatar and that was something I really liked.  I hope that I will see more of that in later episodes.  In the meantime, great action sequences and interesting characters."
B007QYRCX6 I really enjoyed the story and felt it was a little better than Avatar: last airbender. I like how they tied everything together from avatar to present day."
B007R9XAB8 These girls reallty do learn how to dance professionally. A shame the mothers behave like idiots.  Abby Lee does her job otherwise the girls would not be so good"
B007R9XAB8 I watched this because I really like the original Dance Moms with Abby Lee Miller.  This is about a dance studio taught by 2 guys and it is enjoyable.  I think the original Dance Moms is better but this show was with an interesting cast of characters in it.  If you like Dance Moms you will enjoy this show"
B007R9XAB8 Like the dancing, the kids, the moms ... the dance teacher seriously needs therapy to address her multiple issues!  Also would have liked more backstory information - i.e. the mom who couldn't make the stage performances because she had to work - what type of work does she do that's so urgent she can't get out of it?  and why are there no other family members that can sit in her place?"
B007R9XAB8 The coaches have the best interest's of the children at heart. The contrast between the mothers and the coaches is sadly remarkable. The dancer's trust their coaches but are so manipulated by their mother's it's hard to watch. The children have no say in their dancing futures because of their mom's selfish whims. Tragic for the children, but if you'd like an example of how NOT to parent, watch this show!"
B007R9XAB8 I wasn't prepared for this.  I have seen crazy 'stage' moms on T&T;, but they're kittens compared to these rabid banshee dance moms.  These women are just wretched, their behavior certifiably insane and so obviously living the life they wished they had through their children.  So if you like watching presumed adults at their absolute worst then this would be a good match.My heart broke for these kids who are trying their best to learn an art they obviously love.  They are thrown into the meat-grinder by moms who are screaming at each other daily without a care that the children are hearing every hurtful word.  This one bad-mouthing that ones child, complaining about assignments, about the time each gets, the dance they get to do, whether or not they get a solo, etc.  Shame on them.  They should not be allowed to watch rehearsals, they should be forced to leave the building, go home, go shopping, just go.  Let the kids dance.The children are marvelous.  It's amazing to watch these kids all under the age of 12 dance!!  I loved watching them, but the mothers always ruined it, not only for me the viewer, but for the children.  The dance instructors are firm but good and it shows in the advancement of the kids, and the kids love them.What I would like to see is the family and friends of these insane women watch each program.  I would like to see them forced to defend their behavior with those closest to them.  I would like them to feel the sting of humiliation, just like the kids are forced to week after week as the quasi-adults misbehave behind a thin sheet of glass."
B007R9XAB8 SEEMS THAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO PLAY OFF &#34;DANCE MOM'S WITH ABBY MILLER&#34; EXCEPT THERE ARE TWO DANCE COACHES ONE WHO IS LIKE ABBY AND ONE WHO PAMPERS THE KIDS, AND IT IS TWO BROTHERS WHO RUN THE COMPANY, THEIR MOTHER RUNS THE DESK AND TAKES CARE OF THE DANCE MOMS."
B007RV6X2Y Foley spent twenty-five years in prison, had plenty of time to erase the past, gets released and begins to contemplate on a New beginning. However, regardless of his efforts, he finds himself getting involved with ghosts of his past. Once again, he's out on the streets and meets trouble face-to-face. Intense Suspense, Action-Packed, and Great Acting Performance of Samuel L. Jackson. A compelling story with chills and thrills. Highly Recommended!"
B007RV6X2Y By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiThat's Foley's (Samuel L. Jackson) new monto, \"Nothing changes unless you make it change.\"&#8200;He should know. He's spent the last 25 years in prison for killing his partner and best friend,Up until that moment he was one of the best grifters around. He had business savvy and knew how to work a con the smart way.Now that he's finally getting out, Foley is determined to change.But there's a problem. Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former partner wants to be a grifter, he wants to learn from the best and he won't take \"no\" for an answer.He's got a mark, his boss Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) and claims with Foley's help they can take him for eight million.Foley has met a young woman Iris (Ruth Negga) and feels he's got a real chance of leaving his old life behind. Ethan won't give up and finally get's his way, when he forces Iris into the mix.The Samaritan is an OK&#8200;movie, that could have been a great movie. It has two major things going for it. First, Samuel L. Jackson - the way he rolls his eyes, that road-weary persona, that determination not to go back to jail but a necessary convincing flip-flop when they include the woman he loves. Second, The Samaritan is a good con movie. You constantly find yourself trying to figure out who is conning who, or if anyone can be trusted at all.The downside is the film tries to balance too many themes in 90 minutes, worth a look but forgettable."
B007RV6X2Y Anyone anticipating \"The Samaritan\" to be a high octane thrill ride will probably have those expectations thwarted.  Truthfully, I also didn't expect much from this Blu-ray and thought it would be an exercise in conventional action mayhem.  It is, however, a movie with a lot more on its mind. \"The Samaritan\" is a surprisingly contemplative film about redemption and second chances.  Featuring a solid Samuel Jackson, the screenplay takes its time in building a genuinely interesting story.  Jackson gives one of his more complex performances as a man struggling to create a new life, a new identity, and start afresh.  He's great and the movie serves up some terrifically unpleasant surprises (the twist at the half way point is a doozy)!  But just as the movie approaches the final act, it falters.  An intricate con to swindle a crime lord out of millions of dollars is set up with almost zero preparation and back story.  If a clever grift is essential to your screenplay, however, it needs to be smart and believable (or in some cases breezy and fun).  This one is so ill-conceived (major players change out hours before the meet, this must be one idiotic crime boss to not check out ANYTHING) that it almost derails the picture just when it's reaching the most pivotal moments.Jackson plays an ex-con, recently paroled after a 25 year stint.  He wants to live a quiet life, but he gets drawn into the criminal world again by the son of a former associate (Luke Kirby).  Although reticent, Jackson allows Kirby an entrance due to the fact that he was personally responsible for his father's death.  When a young woman in Kirby's employ (Ruth Negga) comes between the two, it just might be the leverage that Kirby needs to get Jackson to sign on for a job.  Can Jackson extricate himself from an ever-tightening web?  The build-up leads to a final confrontation (Tom Wilkinson plays the mark) that is effectively staged and emotional.  But it really falls short in a set-up.  Without believing anything about this final scenario, it really lessened the impact of the movie.  The vibe of the film is gritty realness, this ending just didn't follow through on that promise.Still, if you are a Jackson fan, this is one of his more nuanced roles of late.  Beaten down by life, his detachment has a chilly truth.  He is still a great actor capable of showcasing complex and multi-leveled roles, and this definitely qualifies.  I liked Kirby's cool menace as well.  Once again, \"The Samaritan\" works best when considered an introspective character study.  It is marketed more as a non-stop action movie, though, and that really doesn't address the primary audience for the movie.  This has a slow burn pace that builds tension.  I just wish that the payoff was smarter.  I went from being deeply engrossed to rolling my eyes in disbelief within minutes.  About 3 1/2 stars.  Let's hope Jackson keeps taking more challenging roles.  KGHarris, 9/12."
B007RV6X2Y I will admit I picked out this movie to watch because Samuel Jackson plays the main role.  He is a convict who leaves jail after serving 25 year sentence for killing his best friend.  Once out of the jail he wants to go back to living a normal life.  All of his former convict buddies who went back to the life of crime end up dead sooner or later.However, our character just seems not to be able to break away from the people who want to suck him back in to the life of crime.  It is a game of grift and $8MM is at stake.  Too much money to pass and his enemies are willing to pull every trick in the book to pull him back into the game.  There are some quite unexpected twists and turns in the plot as movie goes on.  I enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed the story and Samuel Jackson has pulled this one all by himself.  I just loved his acting."
B007RV6X2Y Samaritan(released Mar/12),otherwise known as Fury,stars Samuel L. Jackson as Foley,Gil Bellows as Bartender Bill,Tom Wilkinson as Xavier,Luke Kirby as Ethan and others.Filmed in and around Toronto,this drama of a grift/con gone wrong,with a twist,is nothing we have not seen over and over again,and nothing in its make up suggests it to stand head and shoulders above the rest.The story involves an ex grifter,Jackson,who gets out of prison after 25 years.He went away for having been forced to kill his partner in crime.Now Kirby,his ex partner's son,is back and is dogging Jackson and wants an explanation as to why Jackson killed his dad.He gets a pretty grim story.The son is running a club,ultimately owned by Wilkinson,who comes around every so often to check out his property.Thrown into this mix is a young lady who Kirby gets to cozy up with Jackson.He spurns her advances but the next night she comes into a bar with a john,and he forces himself on her in the bathroom.He breaks up the situation and the young lady,after that night,keeps asking after Jackson repeatedly until one night she finds him.They end up a little drunk and back at her place.The two eventually end up sleeping together,with Jackson moving in.Things are starting to get a little too comfortable for Jackson who,with a suspicious eye,asks the girl if Kirby sent him.She admits at first he did but after it was her choice,as she developed real feelings for him.One day Kirby comes sniffing around yet again with an idea for a con.When Jackson refuses Kirby tells him that his girlfriend is really his daughter.Jackson is totally gobsmacked and gets physically sick.Jackson goes to a close friend of the woman he had the child with and who brought up his daughter and she confirms his suspicions.The next time though he meets Kirby,Kirby has a deal he cannot refuse or otherwise his daughter will find out the truth.Jackson is forced to go along with a grift to con Kirby's boss.Kirby enlists the aide of a lady who is totally familiar with the con game,but she ends up hanging herself at Kirby's apartment to get out from under Kirby's debt and the huge risk involved.Jackson walks out only to have Kirby show up at the bar he is in and he hands Jackson his phone.On the other end is his daughter pleading for his help.She is pretending to Wilkinson that she is Jacskon's daughter and she is in debt for $1.5 million.The con has started without him.Jackson may be enraged but he now must go along to save his daughter.Jackson appears at an abandoned house and the con begins.Just as things are rolling along Jackson daughter spills the beans and admits the whole thing is a con to Wilkinson,much to Jackson and Kirby's amazement.The girl also tells Jackson that she already knows she is his daughter.When the dust all clears Kirby and Wilkinson are dead and Jackson is severely wounded and his daughter near death.Jackson rushes her to a prison friend who knows a little bit of doctoring skills.He is forced to give his daughter a blood transfusion,which unfortunately ends up killing him.The film ends as his daughter,with a renewed life,and the money earned from the con gone bad,is walking on a tropical beach.The story certainly has its twists and turns and the cast,especially Jackson,are on game throughout.The picture is ably directed and edited but there is just nothing here out of the ordinary to speak of to set it apart from a myriad of other such films from the past,recent and older.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.Extras include interviews and a featurette.All in all a pedestrian film of grifting and its consequences.An average film with an average mark."
B007RV6X2Y This movie was pretty decent. I like most anything Samuel Jackson is in and this was no exception. Good action."
B007RV6X2Y Here comes something a little unexpected in the dawning weeks of the Summer blockbuster season, it's an old school action-thriller with a film noir soul, the kind of movie in the hard manned style that a few decades earlier could have easily starred screen greats like Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. Playing just a few screens away from superheroes, aliens, and water logged battleships is this, a movie relying on acting, emotion, thought, empathy and good old fashion butt kicking. However, don't let me sell you a bottle of snake oil, The Samaritan is the kind of movie where the sum of it's parts are better than it is as a whole, but it does offer some juicy cuts.Samuel L. Jackson, in one of his best roles in ages, stars as Foley, a former grifter just being released from prison after serving a twenty-five year stretch. With no intent of ever going back, however old troubles from his past come looking for him in the form of Ethan (Luke Kirby).  Ethan is the son of Foley's former partner, whom Foley killed in sucoomanstances that bear special consideration. Not looking for revenge, exactly, but wanting Foley to join him in a confidence scheme. Foley refuses in hopes of starting his life anew.Enter Iris (Ruth Negga), a angel with a femme fatale body,  who befriends Foley after he comes to her aid as a good Samaritan with a bad attitude. The wounded old dog and his anguished young paladin, a drug addict and sometimes prostitute, find a real kinship and love for each other. However, like all good things in the movies, it wasn't meant to last. Ethan, and his boss, a merciless gangster named Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) pull Foley back into the life, now that they've found leverage that wont allow him to back out.The story is told pretty straight forward, devoid of the expected convoluted twists and turn. This works both in it's favor and against it's self at the same time, it's refreshing to not be in the realm of the ludicrous, but it does make the proceedings seem fairly obvious, but never stagnant.  It's lack of complexity helps to keep it in the style of  the genre's triumphs of the distant past, in some ways it reminds me of last years undervalued and little seen Michael Caine old school vigilante flick Harry Brown.This Canadian made movie is directed by David Weaver, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Elan Mastai,  Weaver has mostly worked in Canadian television up to this point, but he shows real promise as a film director, he has a keen eye for detail. The script isn't the greatest, it could have used an infusion of snappy dialogue and the resolution is a little too tidy and forced, still there are a few good tender scenes written in for Foley and Iris, well played by the actors. Good production values, enhanced by fine looking cinematography by Francois Pagenais keep the low budgeted film from ever appearing as such.The casting is very good, I can't remember the last time that Jackson was this good on screen, he served as one of the executive producers on the film, so his belief in the material is evident. After a few years of forgettable, mostly unseen films, some of them actually going directly to DVD, he know seems to be back on track.  Alongside his scene stealing role in The Avengers and a well received turn on Broadway as Martin Luther King, Jr., I hope that this is nothing less than the redemption of Sam Jackson.Tom Wilkinson, the wonderful British character actor who can also be seen in theaters right now in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, steals his few, but delightful scenes. He has a real menace, laced with strychnine charm and a hint of Hannibal Lector in his voice. Newcomer Ruth Negga is also very good as Iris, an Irish born actress I learned, but you would never guess it here, her Canadian accent is flawless. I  have not seen her before, but she makes an immediate impression. The weakest link in the cast is another new face, Luke Kirby in the pivotal role of Ethan, he's too banal and farcically self confident to ever make the role his own. You can't believe this guy as hoodlum working for Wilkinson's Xavier, he would chew him up and spit him out before the opening titles finished.So if big bangs and special effects got you down, and your not exactly looking for art house fare, but rather something a little grittier this could be the answer, at least until Savages opens. Fans of old school killing and action stars, will welcome this, as there seems to be few genuine tough guys out there anymore; welcome home, Mr. Jackson.check out m reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B007RV6X2Y Samuel L. Jackson gets out of prison after 25 years. There is no one there to greet him. He attempts to locate people from his past, only to find out they are dead, moved on, or don't want anything to do with him...all except for one man, Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former grifter partner, the man Jackson killed. Jackson attempts to avoid criminal activity and Ethan, but his past is there to haunt him. You know a con is going to happen, but who is going to con who?The movie limps along holding your interest, but like any grifter movie, the ending is what determines the genius and likability of the production...dropping clues and hints along the way about the sting and twist. This one really didn't do it very well, although it does have a wicked twist. Rental at best.F-bombs, sexual situations, nudity (Ruth Negga) 2 1/2 stars."
B007RV6X2Y \"Nothing changes unless you make it change.\" After 20 years in prison for killing his friend Foley (Jackson) is out and is determined to go straight. Less then a day after being released he runs into some old friends and discovers the old life isn't easy to escape from and the only way out is to go back in. I have to start by saying that I have never been a Samual L. Jackson fan. I liked him in \"Pulp Fiction\" but he plays that character in every movie that he has done (except \"Resurrecting The Champ\"). This movie is no different, although for some of it he is toned down and isn't screaming every line. The movie itself is really not original. Guy gets out of jail and wants to go legit...meets people he used to know...has to pull off one last job...yada yada yada. While the ending of the movie is really good and helps the movie getting to the end is a struggle. Some parts are good while others are pretty boring and tends to drag on. There are really interesting plot points that are brought up and forgot about which makes no sense. The movie isn't all bad though and if you are a Sam Jackson fan you will really enjoy this one. For me the last movie he did \"Meeting Evil\" was much better. Overall, not a bad movie but nothing to rush and see. I give it a C+."
B007RV6X2Y In \"The Samaritan\" Samuel L. Jackson is Foley, an ex-grifter set free after serving twenty-five years in jail. While he finds solace in living with a young, drug-addicted girl Iris (Ruth Negga), Foley is forced into a swindle by Ethan (Luke Kirby), whose dead father was once Foley's partner in crime. And Ethan seems to know some secret about Foley that even the former confidence man does not know.The film is best described as a film noir. Like some of the classics of the genre (\"Night and the City,\" for instance), the twist-filled story revolves around our anti-hero with a criminal past, who dreams of a better life with a woman he loves, and whose plans may go wrong at any time. The difference is that Foley is not very willing to take part in the scheme, as money is not exactly what he is after.Samuel L. Jackson delivers an effectively restrained performance as a tired ex-con man whose only concern is to stay out of trouble. But trouble follows him wherever he goes. He is a sort of a person who, while running away from one predicament, runs into another bigger and nastier one, and Samuel L. Jackson as that person is convincing. The interesting cast includes Gil Bellows, Deborah Kara Unger and Tom Wilkinson.\"The Samaritan\" is flawed, however, and flawed in more than one way. For those who have seen a certain Asian thriller (which should remain unnamed here), the idea upon which the plot of \"The Samaritan\" rests may appear a familiar one. That itself didn't bother me as writers David Weaver (who also directs) and Elan Mastai have developed it in a totally different way, but the ending is disappointment because the dilemma and complexity Jackson's character faces are sorted out in a too neat fashion.\"The Samaritan\" is a crime thriller that requires a pretty big suspension of disbelief at some scenes (and I am not just talking about the genre conventions). Once you get past that part, you will find the film a thrilling ride with Samuel L. Jackson's strong performance."
B007RV6X2Y This is a very good movie that will keep you guessing all the way to the end. Samuel L. Jackson performance is outstanding as always. Ruth Negga, a newcomer, is also really good.Foley (Jackson) gets released from prison after serving 25 years for killing his partner. His partner's son wants revenge. Not the usual kind, a different kind of revenge. Then Iris (Ruth Negga), appears and falls in love with Foley. Everything is slow and for a moment we think is a love story or a back stubbing plot. At the 40 minute mark of the movie the plots gets really twisted and then we start guessing all the way to the end which is a surprise.Four stars for the decent plot and the acting. Look forward to watch more movies with Ruth Negga. She has a great future in the business."
B007T05BSK I read the other reviews before writing my own.  The interesting thing is the case was solved.  It would be great if the episode was amended to include the rest of the case.  The &#34;psychics&#34; were basically dead wrong, and the police were right all along.  If the detective had found the lost tip, instead of wasting time with these &#34;psychics&#34;, the case might have been solved sooner.  To read about the case, just google &#34;Susannah Chase murder&#34;."
B007T05BSK excellent true life presentation of issues related to use of psychics for investigation.  well balanced and no hype. usual quality for ID"
B007T05BSK I found this fascinating.  It is amazing how they pick up on the facts of a case.  I think you will enoyed watcing it too."
B007T05BSK Reality check here! Nothing is actually solved, no one is identified and there is no 'closure.' Given the same information, what would your 'guess' be? Obviously murder lurks unsolved and foreboding, who committed the crime, where and with what? Ah! Perhaps  it was Mrs. Peacock in the library with a candlestick . . . or could it be Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with a knife? There would appear to be no doubt as to why this series was canceled or is there? Have some funky fun and find your own answer!"
B007T05BSK these women never discover anything. they 'sense' things that have been in the news for months at one time. even tho they've faded from public view, they never really come up with any enlightenment."
B007T05BSK Though physics are brought in to help the police in most cases they can't or don't solve the crime(s) and updates aren't given (thus what I have seen so far.) I think when putting together a series such as this with programs already product and shown that updates should be added after each program OR noted that the case is still cold."
B007T05BSK Down to earth, real life episodes into cold case detecting. Easy to follow, understand, and leaves you to make up your own mind as to outcome."
B007TADRIG I like CSI: 
B007TADRIG I Just started watching this series and I am up to episode 12.  I love the cast, particularly Gary S.  and since I live in NY I am veryfamiliar with the settings and feel at home watching this.  It took some getting use to because though I am a big CASTLE fan andthat is set in NY too, this show seems to be darker and much less humorless.  I hope as the show goes on that I will find a bit morehuman feelings between the  characters develop.  Still, I find it good enough to order the first 7 seasons on DVDs; goes along wellwith my BONES, CASTLE and MENTALIST sets.  Now I am watching season one on my Video Library.  I do recommend this tomy fellow telly watching crime fighter viewers.Since I wrote the above review I have finished season 1 of CSI NY.  I think it was splendid; in some ways it reminds me of CASTLE, beingset in Manhattan and visualizing the landscape with very similar photography.  But it is more gritty, like CHICAGO PD, than Castle withoutmuch of the humor, though the last few episodes seem to humanize the cast better.  I happen to think that Gary Sinese is splendid in the chiefrole of boss and the other cast members do well also.  I have ordered the entire 9 season DVD sets from Amazon and trying to be patient waitingfor them.  I think it takes some getting use to the darker stories in the programs if you are used to Bones or Castle, but watch it: it willgrow on you.  Though I live in NY and love the city, I don't really like Manhattan though this show makes me almost like it.  Its a hell ofa town though the Sears Tower is still technically taller than the \"Freedon\" Tower.  But the subways are nice.  enjoy!"
B007TADRIG As usual csi ny grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the hour. Good starter for season with several twist which makes the audience become involved"
B007TADRIG Characters are good but they could do a little more to make the characters moreinteresting.  Stories are well written."
B007TADRIG This is one good show.  Everthing about it is great....stories, cast, production, video, etc.  This show did not need to \"develop\" or mature.  It was great from episode one.  I really enjoy it more than other CSI shows.  Although Ted Danson and Elizabeth Shue made CSI more outstanding.  Recommended."

Made in Canada with excellent production values, casting, directing, acting, and music.  The series centers around an Agoraphobic Russian Chess Champion that lives in the Huxley luxury hotel and solves cases to pay for his expenses.  After his wife's death in a drive by killing he fears the outside to such a degree he has panic attacks when he gets near an exit.  He enlists the aid of a hotel maid, bartender, and security staff along with a college student to assist him in solving cases at the Hotel and elsewhere.  After watching the free rental pilot I bought the first and only season (2011), and I love this short-lived TV series.  They considered making additional seasons but unfortunately didn't follow through.Recommendations:Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4,Masterpiece Mystery: Endeavour [HD], andJustified: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray].CA Luster"
B007UMJSZE My husband and I love this series, we couldn't wait till evening to settle in and watch this on our Roku together! Funny, heart wrenching, snarky, and super fun! I sure wish this series was on the TV, why do they always cancel the good ones?!"
B007UMJSZE The star of this show is a former Russian world champion Chess master. His wife was murdered, but he also believes the murder was an attempt on his life - a conspiracy. This occurred outside the \"Huxley\" hotel in what appears to be Vancouver, B.C. As a result of the trauma, out star is agoraphobic and will not go outside the hotel. He attempts to solve the mystery of his wife's murder with help from his sister in law, the very cute Pipa (sp) (the underlying ongoing subplot).To make ends meet, he solves various crimes that occur in and around the hotel. Since he will not leave the hotel, he is aided in in his investigations by a graduate student (Sam) who helps in exchange for chances to play the grandmaster; Dani, the beautiful bartender; and a delightful maid.Being arrogant, demanding, and disruptive, he has love/hate relationships with hotel management and security, whom he constantly insults yet they too often need his help.While solving each episodes mystery, there are very nice sequences where he plays the possible scenarios in his head (while we watch and listen).Although the mysteries are good, it is the humor and quirkiness that endear me to this show. It is both funny and a mystery; a unique idea and perspective. I was not immediately impressed by this series, but after a few episodes, I was hooked. Can't wait for next season. It is not expensive so I recommend buying the entire season and give it a chance or at least a few episodes before you write this one off."
B007UMJSZE Endgame has interesting characters with challenging plots that provide for good drama and comedy. I would have enjoyed a second season if it wre available."
B007UMJSZE I really enjoyed this one. Cute, quirky, fun characters. Original, unpredictable stories. Good acting- I really thought this guy was Russian. (He's Canadian.) I would have loved a season two."
B007UMJSZE NO SPOILERS:Arkady Balagan, a Russian chess champion is in Vancouver for a competition with his fiancee Rosemary, who is gunned down in the street outside their hotel seemingly without reason.  Balagan has developed agoraphobia and cannot leave the hotel. A case falls into his lap and while initially reluctant, to help with his mounting hotel bills, Balagan takes the case.Arkady is aided in his endeavors by a young chess protege who works for lessons, his sister-in-law Pippa and a sexy bar manager at the hotel.  Throughout the season clues to his finance's murder come to light.This is a very unique show and I almost subtracted a star for ending the series without resolution.  However, it is different enough to merit a watch."
B007UMJSZE I guess Im the only person that watched this show. ( Which is to bad cause it rocks!) This show is about a Russian chess player with sever agoraphobia. Except in his case he is trapped in a very expensive five star hotel that he can not leave without having a panic attack and passing out. He wants to stay but is running out of funds. Through a quirky turn of events he starts to make money solving crimes, so that he can stay in his hotel. Acting by the lead actor is well done to say the least. The supporting cast is a quirky bunch of misfits. And the female bartender is super hot! (my opinion) If you like shows like Life, or Castle, or Leverage, you might give this one a try."
B007UMJSZE Clever and funny with a flakey chess master who can solve mysteries without leaving the hotel in which he lives.  Found this program while searching for something that I could justify paying to see."
B007UMJSZE I really enjoyed it and am now eager to watch further episodes.  Hope they are all as delightful.  What a character!"
B007UMJSZE For more info on this show and the cast, Wikipedia has a very good article: Endgame (TV series).I enjoyed the series.  It is different and not the usual detective story.  The writing is smart, complicated, interresting and always with good heart.  The filming is creative and innovative - very good storytelling.  Not for everyone apparently, this Canadian show was canceled after only one season of 13 episodes."
B007UMJSZE This is an intriguing plot idea about the workings of a bright human mind & heart in a colorful chess master. It does so with a light touch & what as a Texan, I would describe as the quirky Canadian sense of humor . The settings feature  playful, colorful backgrounds. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
B007UMJSZE The idea of a chess master, crime solver is nice. Add into that he can not leave the hotel. The supporting characters are wonderful. The show just kept getting better and we were so disappointed to discover it had only one season. I really like Elementary, The Closer, Monk, Psych, Due South and this show seemed in that vein. Also no gratuitous violence or sexual imagery."
B007UMJSZE The series is good . . . great . . excellent, but I just didn't like the main character.  True, it means the actor has portrayed his character excellently!  However the character is one that I would never want to be around if such a person existed in real life.  Unfortunately, the personality grates me and I hung on through the first episode mainly so that I would never have to put up with that character again."
B007UMK3SA I love the Irish countryside and hate Costello! The show starts to get a little to much like a soap opera for me. But I still enjoyed it."
B007UMK3SA Taut murder investigations, with interesting plot-lines and characters.  As incredible as some of the stories can be, they still seem possible."
B007UMK3SA It's not the fastest moving series but the good guy triumphs in the end. It's a worthwhile series to watch. The scenery on the west coast of Ireland is beautiful too."
B007UMK3SA This shows off the beauty and darkness of rural Ireland beautifully, and the actors are very good, but the background story (at least two seasons worth!) overwhelms the individual episodes and it's presented in an annoying manner."
B007UMK3SA Thankfully there is a second season, was fearful that it was a one season wonder.  Still more devious doings in the west of Ireland, and we thought that they were all saints and scholars there.  Makes for an exciting and intriguing watch always a cliffhanger that somehow gets tidied up in the most unexpected way."
B007UMK3SA Interesting series about a Sergeant in a remote area of Ireland.  Not everything is black and white.  There are a number of murders which must be solved.  As with most UK films, I wish they would provide captioning so that we could understand what they are saying."
B007UMK3SA The story lines are well acted and thought out but our main character lets his emotions get him. I like the multi plot lines and hints of intrigue to come.i only wish there were most epeisodes as ther is a lot to uncover in the town by Jack,."
B007UMK3SA Just as good as the first Season.  Really liked the characters and the plot was engaging. Worth watching more than once."
B007UMK3SA Atmosphere and intensity. I wishes they made more of these. This is the kind of series I like to marathon.  I'll be back to flesh this out, just wanted to mark it as a good one. Dark, serious, almost relentless."
B007UMK3SA I enjoy the slower, thoughtful drama with interesting characters. I especially like the fact that guns aren't used, or even seen.Characters are realistic, not perfect, not all nice:human."
B007UMK3SA Good stories, well developed.  Good characters, well drawn and excellently acted.  Good scenes of Ireland.  Highly recommended not the least because there is good suspense but no gratuitous violence or bad language.."
B007UMK3SA Owen McDonnell does a fantastic job of portraying Jack Driscoll, a former Dublin cop who leaves his post in Dublin for reasons unclear at this point, and moves back to his home town to take over the 2 man police department.  Problem is, before retiring, his father had held this position for many years and his father has ruled the town with an iron fist and back room deals.  Can Jack step out of his father's shadow?  Can he navigate the murky political waters of this community and retain not only his integrity and his job but his also his life?  I like the character of Jack Driscoll because he is flawed and he makes some rather large mistakes.....his choice in women being his number one mistake.  Good cast, good writing and the town in which the story is set is just beautiful to see.  Can't wait for the next season!"
B007UMK3SA These keep getting better and better!  I hope they continue with a season 3!!  Better than most cable and pbs series currently available to watch!"
B007UMK3SA The series was well thought  out and it takes place in Ireland. I coiuld actually understand most of the language. To bad the series is over. Lots of plots thru each episode. Worth a watch."
B007UMK3SA This is an interesting look at police life in a small village in Ireland.The problems of politics in a small community take their toll and it is amazing to see how much."
B007UMK3SA Though at times this protagonist seems unbelievably stubborn and somewhat self righteous, he is in fact mostly right about how he acts amid a great deal of difficulty amongst a population which seems more likely to behave in an underhand rather than a totally honest way.  I wonder if  Ireland is really like this.  I would hate to think this is an accurate rendition of the general population, but I find the acting excellent, the stories always interesting, and the scenery glorious"
B007UMK3SA Being a police procedural freak, I found this series like nothing I had ever seen on the screen.  The starkness of the countryside painted a back drop for the characters living and working there.  While crime and murder come into play, I found the character development to be what actually made for a 5-star review."
B007UMK3SA At times I'm not sure how I feel about this show.  Worth watching, though.  I wish there were more characters to actually like."
B007UMK3SA I loved the cinematography of this program. Excellent characters and well acted. Enjoyed the three seasons immensely, however I had to get used to the Irish accents. Love it."
B007UMK3SA I resisted watching this because of the price. I was pleasantly pleased when it was included in Prime.At first, the series may seem slow. An young Irish detective from the city returns to his childhood home - a simultaneously bleak yet beautiful village in a remote, small, Irish village. The star has returned home as the ranking detective, with only an older officer (who has highly questionable loyalties) for help. He is also replacing his father, who is retired .This series explores the complexities of small community isolation and borderline incestuous relationships developed as much out of isolation as love. So are the mixed loyalties.This is predicated upon a well written crime mystery which does not have the predictability of American television. The actual mysteries are complicated by the fore-mentioned complexity of the isolated community. The starring detective is young and idealistic even as personal connections and the haunting of his father's misdeeds test his ethics. At first, this series seems to move a bit slow, until one realizes the intricate relationships are the story and the crime mysteries are a vehicle to explore them.Watch season one first for background as this review applies equally to both (the first episode of the first season being especially good). I agree with the previous review - only one episode a day. It is too much for more, a testament to the the depth of this series, and how overwhelming the dreariness can be impact one. Not an mindless show, nor always easy to watch. It is not \"short attention span theater\"."
B007UMK3SA I liked the second season better than the first.  I may have become invested in the program and wanted to see the characters succeed.  Shaun, the young police sergeant trying to fill his father's shoes to prove he would be a better policeman is a good story line. I think there is a lot of potential for this series."
B007UMK3SA Lesser known actors and a good sturdy plot give this stoical tale of Northern Ireland cop shop a nice different flavor compared to the unusual police formula show. The scenery alone is delightfully different and the dilemma faced by N. Irish Jack in facing corruption and incompetence and a forlorn love life is compelling and we'll worth a second look."
B007UMK3SA I picked thi program because I love the police and mystery series from the isles and this one is superb;  intense, realistic, and held my attention thru and thru."
B007UMK3SA A good detective/police stories of a very small Ireland country city. Good look at the Ireland cost-land and country side."
B007UMK3SA Reasonably entertaining with decent acting and interesting story lines. Recommended for those who are into the genre as well as those with an interest in Ireland."
B007UMK3SA Jack continues to be a one man struggle against evil; his own interior demons as well as the external criminal ones he must catch and deliver to justice.  He is attracted to another flawed woman, and again must manage the difficulties of adult, ambivalent relationship.  This is not an easy series; Jack is an interesting character; a bully, a softy, a devoted son, a lover, and a moralist.  He even veers toward parenting in this series: not his own child, but the cherished child of friends.  In short, this series deals with  the mature complexity of competent middle age.  Worth re-watching."
B007UMK3SA It seems every episode has both a criminal case and family/personal issues for Jack that manage to intersect as he tries to solve both.  Gritty and sometimes disturbing issues, but it keeps your interest.  Sorry that this series ended so soon."
B007UMK3SA This is a great show. It's well written, has wonderful cinematography and interesting story lines. I would highly recommend this show, especially for people who enjoy British mysteries."
B007UMK3SA This was an entertaining series about two generations of law enforcement officers in a small town. Throw in a little scandal, loyalty, family greed and insubordination. Some premises seemed a little far fetched b
B007UMK3SA Really, there is no way someone who speaks English can make much sense of the dialog in this series, but reading it would really help.  So, HELP!"
B007UMK3SA Incredible photography-great scripts-both my wife & I love it! We can't wait for the next season to arrive so that we can gobble it up..."
B007UMK3SA a good change from cable, and NO COMM....even tho it's a little draggy, the scenery is amazing, how in the world did anything survive there....."
B007UMK3SA Single-Handed offers the complexity of what some people would consider the simple life of a small community in Ireland.  Jack tries very hard to earn the trust of the locals, but sometimes he lets them down.  I like the &#34;human&#34; quality that the writers emphasize in his character.  Just because you wear a uniform doesn't instantly dismiss the conflicts of character.  I admire the persistence of Jack's character, however, to follow good.  I always look forward to the next episode, knowing that the same problems are encountered in the everyday lives of people no matter where they live."
B007UMK3SA The Irish live up to their reputation as good story tellers.  This series gives a realistic slice of Ireland in the Galway area of western Ireland."
B007UMK3SA Single-Handed Season 2 episodes were as exciting as season 1. They also stepped the complexity up and increased the number of intermingled story lines. The characters remain plausible and emotionally evocative. This is a great series for the scenery alone."
B007UMK3SA series starts a little slow but becomes excellent. great filming,, acting and writing. sorry there arent more to watch. great"
B007UMK3SA STILL TRYING TO RAISE HIMSELF UP ABOVE HIS FATHER'S LOOSE WAYS. THE BONUS IS VISITING IRELAND COUNTRY SIDE. YOU MEET SOME LONG LOST RELATIVES."
B007UMK3SA I totally enjoyed this series.  Too bad there were only 2 seasons.  He truely solved each case single handed as everyone else seemed to work against him with different theories,"
B007UMK3SA Following in the footsteps of a parent in a profession is hard enouh, but being honest and forthright to a fault and then following in the footsteps of a parent who chose to be corrupt is almost impossible.  This story is compelling and the acting is excellent and I wish there were more seasons!"
B007UMK3SA Great crime show with a twist in that it is based in Ireland and not the US or UK like so many are. The stories are good and not hokey like it could have turned out to be.  The scenery is pretty.  My only complaint is that the main character is really the only normal one. The rest are pretty lacking in ethics- even his mom turns out to be a little shady."
B007UMK3SA I loved this show throughout all the seasons."
B007UMK3SA absolutely loved this series, at 1st.The 1st. season there were times & situations that made me uncomfortable, but I really began to cheer on the young Driscoll, as much as I came to despise his father. Hated to see this series come to an end. Loved or loved to hate the characters."
B007UMK3SA Same story line. Interesting cultural shift and scenic locale. Seems the &#34;Murder Plot&#34; will never grow old. Yada Yada Yada...."
B007UMK3SA This series, typical of the United Kingdom/Irish TV, has only a few episodes a season. The characters are very believable and the plots are often surprising. The series is very brutal in its honest depiction of the Irish country side. Has a slightly meloncholic tenor to it, much like Mankell's Wallander series."
B007UMK3SA Amazing storytelling, great acting -- what more do you want from a television series? So smart -- and the scenery, holy cow!! Only wish there were more episodes."
B007UMK3SA Not much I can say about this series except I enjoyed watching it. If you like BBC type of investigative who done its you'll most likely like this."
B007UMK3SA I love this series!  My ancestors are from Ireland so I love the scenery & the dialect.  The storylines are great. Can't say enough good abt this series!"
B007UMK3SA I'm sorry that it was just a mini series. The characters were great, the acting was convincing, and of course the scenery was amazing."
B007UMK3SA Love the premise of hometwon boy returning home.  It reminds me of an american soap opera but with an Irish accent."
B007UMK3SA The subject matter and acting are well worth time in watching this exciting, convoluted program. And of course Ireland is one of my favorite settings."
B007UMK3SA Love the way the actors/actresses are &#34;everyday people.&#34;  They don't try to glam them up.  Hope they make more of this show."
B007UMK3SA This second season has a lot of holes in it but still enjoyable to watch. By holes I mean missing characters whose absence could be covered by a few lines of dialogue. I look forward to season 3 if there is one and I hope there is."
B007UMK3SA More like this please.  I do not understand why I need to post a certain number of words in order to review.  Seems silly"
B007UMK3SA The story lines are interesting and the characters have depth. The setting of Ireland is a nice change. Compelling stories"
B007UMK3SA Excellent entertainment...gritty and real.  Can't wait for next season.  I love the Irish setting, gives me a glimpse of what life is like in that area."
B007UMK3SA From Ballykissangel's rolling hills of Ireland to the windy shore of Single-Handed I&#34;ve enjoyed this Season 2 story line of a serious Garda who strives to be honest. Many surprises in each episode. I do hope this continues into another season."
B007UMK3SA good sense of life and worth the time to view.  Showed a proper relationship of good over coming evil as the Single Garda stands against corruption in the county he is protecting, even in the face of his own family!Had a tendency to slip into a marsh of altruism, but the central plot pulls the stories back to the side of entertainment."
B007UMK3SA This short series is good and I would recommend it to a friend.  It gets a bit mundane in that he sleeps with every woman that comes into the series."
B007UMK3SA Regardless of how honest and dedicated one can or tries to be --- there's always someone lurking in the background to cause turmoil and trouble --- this series seems to be able to present not only case studies in murder/crime, but also incorporates personalities and interaction as, unfortunately, human nature seems to do.  Totally enjoy the series."
B007UXS5NY Of course, I liked it very much.  Where is season 3 and 4 and 5 and so on and on.  With so much junk out there, I cannot understand why you all quit when you have a good show going.  Keep it coming, please."
B007UXS5NY See my review on season 1, it only disappoints more in the end.  Watch and you'll see, not terrible but just lazy."
B007UXS5NY I had a hard time trying to get into this story. Not something i wanted to spend time watching on."
B007UXS5NY I like that the crimes are not solved after one episode like most American crime dramas. That makes the plot more realistic."
B007UXS5NY This was a good series. A lot of suspense and good acting. I would watch more episodes if they were available."
B007UXS5NY Well done! I enjoyed Season 2 of Without Motive quite a bit. It was engaging, well paced, and I was very interested to see this season out. Seeing Season 1 is a must, however, and I didn't enjoy that season very much at all."
B007UXS5NY This series is wonderfully engaging - the characters are well done and keeps you guessing and the politics behind the scene are interesting"
B007UXS5NY This was a great series.  Good acting and taunt storyline.  I liked it so much I was wondering if there were more episodes out there, but apparently 12 episodes is the max.  That would be season 1 and 2 on Amazon.  There was conclusion in the last episode of Season 2 which was a good thing.  I really hate watching a BBC crime series and the season ends with a cliff hanger, and guess what?  No more seasons available...That's just wrong.If you like police centered crime dramas, then this is for you.  It was very well done, with edge of the seat suspense, and excellent acting. All those factors made it a five star series."
B007UXSDT0 I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child. I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey. I really liked the first season of the series. I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2, #3, #4 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch. I watched it to finish out the series. It is not as good as the previous seasons. I will say that the last episode with Rose Buck, Jean Marsh, leaving the house was sentimental. After watching all of the other seasons, seeing her leave and her remembering some of the people and happenings at the house was very touching."
B007UXSDT0 Great entertainment for teens and adults.it was great to be able to watch the series on prime on my kindle"
B007UXSDT0 Upstairs Downstairs is excellent.  Every single show for 5 seasons was excellent.  Superb acting and story line.  I wish there was a season 6.  I will miss it so."
B007UXSDT0 I enjoyed the series and all of the characters in upstairs downstairs season 5. Now I'm getting ready for season 6. I like the way that the series winds down. Good entertainment and helps to understand those times somewhat."
B007UXSDT0 We loved it!  The story and actors are first class!  Very entertaining work of art.  We highly recommend this series!"
B007UXSDT0 Season 5 has been excellent.  The series cast have all given excellent performances.  Would like to see more programs like this."
B007UXSDT0 Having Downton withdrawals between seasons, I decided to watch Upstairs, Downstairs to fill in the time. Amazing. It only takes one episode to realize Downton is a total rip-off. This is so much better. Excellent story lines and superb acting. I watched all five seasons. The storylines were much racier than I was expecting for 40+ year old television. Set in the same timer period, they hit on the great events of the day, WWI, stock market crash, the introduction of electrcity, the telephone, radio, etc. At times, it may be wondered if the Bellamys may have known the Crawleys, or at least atttended the same functions whenever they traveled to London. Now here's the tough question: Who is the better butler - Hudson or Carson?"
B007UXSDT0 This series manages to expose parts of all our issues, faults, character that require resolution. The writers and actors help us to identify with both servant and master, oppressed and the oppressor. And even though specific topics of our society change over the years, our ways of dealing with them seem to be (unfortunately) consistent. Never have I viewed characters who had so much about to them to admire and at the same time so much to be pitied/frustrated over. Best viewing ever"
B007UXSDT0 Upstairs, Downstairs Season 5 is a blast for my wife and me. We just watched the episode with Ruby's boyfriend - what fun! History, drama, romance, and comedy all portrayed through the great ensemble acting of the talented cast."
B007UXTC2M I found this to be an unusual and interesting series.  Besides the crime, the show offers insight into investigation procedure, as well as, how the investigation affects the individual  police personally.  I watched all three series in one weekend because I could not put it down!"
B007UXTC2M I totally enjoyed this series, although, I missed a good 25% of the lines because Amazon provides no subtitles.  I miss alot of films that Amazon streaming has to offer because subtitles are rarely offered."
B007UXTC2M I love good crime drama with great scripting and plot content.  This met my standard very well indeed.  I hope it has more seasons to come!!"
B007UXTC2M Too much like some of the lame police series we get on network television.  If one likes adultery, back stabbing your co-workers etc they will love this show."
B007UXTC2M This show had potential, a killer similar to Jack the Ripper in present day England.  But it didn't live up to it's potential.  Like so many modern shows it turns into a soap opera about who is sleeping with whom.  You can't tell the good guys from the bad guys, as a matter of fact there doesn't seem to be any good guys.  Acting was good but the writers just didn't do their job."
B007UXTC2M each episode was better than expected and went down different paths than expected. Very good writing and acting. Will watch again."
B007UXTC2M This series starts well, and for the first episodes promises to be a great Brit mystery / detective / serial killer story. The signs of the disaster are however there from the beginning--overacted, over-analyzed personal issues and relations, too many conflicts for a conflicted smart detective and a bunch of bad bosses. Once the thing starts to go down, it simply becomes painful to watch. The plot regarding the investigation, which is good, gets diluted amid unappealing and impossible to believe piles of personal drama. Mind you, the wife of the good detective starts overnight hating her beloved husband because he cannot solve a series of crimes in which the victims are women. This seem to clearly show her that he is a chauvinist who does not care about her. This silly plot line would have made some mild sense if it were not because the detective character not only seems not to be chauvinist but also is spending nights and weekends trying to solve the case, putting up with insufferable bosses, and ruining his career trying to solve the crimes. But the endless insane scenes of matrimonial fights are terrible and cut any mystery line. The fact that later the detective starts an affair with a female detective that, predictably, does not work and ends up involving more insufferable senseless relationship dialogues does not help. Neither does that every boss who is put in charge of the investigation is both and idiot and a bad police. I mean, of course no one will solve these crimes. The character are too occupied being miserable and boring to watch to get the job done."
B007UXTC2M I just finished the first episode ready to keep watching.  Great detective story with a heart.  Interesting characters, but not too much set up like some pilots.  Tears in my eyes a couple of times.  The story completely pulled me in."
B007UXTC2M I loved this series.  I would give it more stars if possible.  The actors are excellent.  The story--though grisly at times-was compelling.  While watching it, I felt I was watching a true life drama.  Warts and all.  This is not some glossy police drama.  I felt bereft when it was over.  This ranks right up there with Prime Suspect.  Why do we have to go to the British to get real life dramas?  I am tired of the US smart mouth series.  Everyone has to be good looking, and have all the answers in three minutes.  But I digress. Buy it!"
B007UXTC2M Season 1 of Without Motive was decent. I appreciated the portrayal of the officers as regular human beings and felt that this may be closer to what a true-life situation might be in an investigation. However, the interactions between the main character and his wife and subsequently some of the other officers seemed off and out of left field. It was so distracting that I considered dropping the show. However, as the season progressed it became more engaging and I was ready to devour Season 2."
B007UXTC2M The main actor Ross Kemp seems to me a cross between Kenneth Branagh and Michael Chiklis, intense, compelling, and adorable.  The drama itself has enough hooks and ladders that I wanted to keep trying to solve the murders too.  Wish it had hidden more clues throughout.  All in all, I enjoyed both seasons."
B007VQLRGW The jet fighter pilots over Korea were amazed to see the Russian built Mig introduced into battle for the first time."
B007VQLRGW This was actually much better than expected. Contrary to one review, I found the narration fast paced and interesting. The technical details are well presented and accurate. The tactical skills of the fighter pilot are graphically demonstrated and the original footage has been well chosen. If you are interested in technical details and tactics this is a well formatted docudrama. For those who are curious about the aura of the 'fighter ace,' this includes a psychological  profile. The description of the F-86 Sabre and the MIG-15 is accurate and includes manufacturing  details as well as maneuverability and equipment.  Worth the time to form your own conclusions."
B007VQLRGW Yes, &#34;Max&#34; is a bit...well...He IS, after all, an F-22 jock.  He's NOT Tom Cruise or Val Kilmer or Glenn Ford.I would have been happy if this went twenty seasons, but alas..."
B007VQLRGW He spends hours watching military documentaries about air battles from every source I can find.  He got tired of the series he was watching and this is a perfect replacement."
B007VQLRGW The personalities of the pilots tend to be more interesting than the planes or re-enactments. As with other WWII vets, interesting to see what they did after the war."
B007VQLRGW Interesting and informative at the same time.  A definite watch for a military history buffs. Enjoyed all of the combat fighter match ups"
B007WPLZAK Sebastian Faulks' novel is highly regarded.  I've not read it, but I'll take people's word that it's good.  Abi Morgan is a talented screenwriter whose work I've enjoyed -- most recently, the series \"The Hour\" and the film \"Shame\".  So I should've liked \"Birdsong\".  But for whatever reason, the potential in this project just didn't gel into anything particularly great.  Perhaps the series needed to be longer:  the love story feels rushed; Eddie Redmayne's compatriots in the trenches just seem like quick sketches; and then it's over.  Well, it's not over before we're given the moral of story, delivered by a guy tragically dying in the trenches.  \"It's all we're good for,\" the guy croakingly soothsays to Redmayne, while the strings weep in the background.  \"To love and be loved.\"  (Hopefully this scene is not in the novel.)But before we get to that pearl of wisdom, we must endure a lot of staring into the middle distance, mostly from Redmayne as he reminiscences about his lost love while in the trenches.  The director was rather cruel to Redmayne, I should think.  The guy is asked to look tragic throughout the whole picture, even in the pre-war scenes.  He's asked to break down and sob a few times.  Actors hate that, by the way.  Worst of all, he's asked to whisper.  A lot.  Almost his entire dialogue is whispered.  If you don't have a decent home theater system with Dolby, you are well advised to turn on the Closed Captioning, unless you enjoy alternating your volume up and down between whispering and bombshells.  I think some directors confuse whispered dialogue with Important Dialogue.The heart of the thing is the love story, but, as I said earlier, the story is too rushed for us to start really rooting for the lovers to come together.  There is some nice intensity between them as they steal glances at each other and play some footsie on a rowboat (for once, all the staring works to a purpose), but it's just not enough.  The lady is married to an impotent man, conveniently enough, and I think she's supposed to be about 10 or so years older than Redmayne.  But Clemence Poesy appears to be the same age as Redmayne, so it's strange when she calls him \"my boy\", and it's even stranger when the 16-year-old daughter of the husband's first marriage calls Poesy \"maman\".  Poesy seems like a fine actor, but this is a Casting Fail.As for the rest of it:  there's a Gallipoli-like futile charge against the Germans that fails because of incompetent planning by the military brass, but really, haven't we seen all this before?  In fact, we've seen it in \"Gallipoli\", a superior movie directed by Peter Weir.  I couldn't connect with the soldiers' mission, and I couldn't connect with them.  One of them wears sweaters, sent from his mother back in England, over his army issue.  Couldn't tell you anything else about him, though.  Perhaps Abi Morgan needed to spend more time on them.  Perhaps the producers needed a bigger budget to expand the series.Or, and here's a thought, maybe the original novel the series is based on isn't all that good to begin with, contrary to received opinion.  All that I learned from \"Birdsong\" is that War, and French Ladies, are Hell.  Tell me something I don't know!  2 out of 5."
B007WPLZAK I absolutely loved this movie!!! The mixture of their romance, the war, and their honor was very touching and was so realistic! Love it and could watch it again!"
B007WPLZAK All i can say is wow! PBS has really became a great channel! this show/movie was so good! i watched it at least a dozen times already!! the cast and acting was superb! PBS spared no expense filing Birdsong, it is blockbuster stuff!"
B007WPLZAK excellent in all respects,"
B007WPLZAK A rating of PG is outrageous.  The explicit  overreach of sexual content is beyond the pale.  This is not a movie for children, teens, twenties, thirties etc......Movie studios need to wake up to their responsibility to the milieu.  When Almighty God told us not to break the Commandments,  He Meant It. A wink and nod has been given to the Movie studios and now we live with the consequences  and spiritual cost of all of it.  Must I explain the difference between love and lust or do most of you get it?  The acting was horrible, the story line was chopped up and the unredeeming end was a poor excuse for a movie. My Uncle fought in the Great War so believe me when I tell you that the men did not sit around the trenchs WHNING. They fought and died to win our freedom from tyranny by pushing the enemy back to Berlin.  This movie belongs in the hall of shame."
B007WPLZAK I love love stories and this is one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's sad and real and will break your heart. The acting is amazing!!"
B007WPLZAK This video novel (I do not think they can make a season of it but maybe) is well done.  It slows a few times but keeps moving.  if you are used to high tech special effects and police chase drama, this is not for you.  This is a deep story with deep and meaningful relationships.  It gives movie viewing satisfaction."
B007WPLZAK I never thought the war segments would be more interesting than the love story.  Poor acting for the love story and so much dead pauses."
B007WPLZAK I'm addicted to English period pieces and brutal love stories.  Great acting, beautifully filmed.  Reminder of how brutal war is."
B007WPLZAK The woman he fell in love with didn't capture her role, I think. Also, I would have liked to know how old she was. He was only 20 in the video. She was married and a stepmother. The war scenes were gruesome, showing how awful WWI was! Is there a season 2? I can't see how Birdsong is a fitting title. Perhaps season 2, if there is one, would tie the title to the video."
B007WPLZAK The main character has the worst attitude concerning his circumstances that I have seen in a while. He was annoying."
B007WPLZAK I just couldn't finish watching this one given the graphic portrayals of the sexual relationship between the two principal characters.  While the relationship was central to what story line I could find (and that in itself was a challenge) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways.  I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off!"
B007WPLZAK I enjoyed the movie, sad but true  War was hard then, and still is. Beats reading a book. Good entertainment."
B007WPLZAK Not the best of period pieces, but enjoyable enough to spend time watching.  Brace yourself for some gorey battle scenes.  Tragedy strikes throughout the entire movie."
B007WPLZAK Love and all the emotions in one movie that made you want more. A movie worth watching of all ages."
B007WPLZAK Have seen this twice and find it just as moving and interesting as I did the first time.  Beautifully played and mounted too. Doesn't get much better than this."
B007WPLZAK I love period films , so this two part series based on a novel was perfect for me . The story takes place in France pre and post WWi and has romance and blood and guts and intertwining life stories .The film was well done .I did find that often words were somewhat mumbly to me because of the accents though spoken in English. Still worth watching."
B007WPLZAK People not communicating and suffering because of it. It had a good ending, and maybe because he's grown up from all the things he experienced, he will have a good life."
B007WPLZAK I just could not get into this show.  The characters were a little bland in my opinion and the story line was moving too slowly.  If I had more time and nothing else to watch, I might have finished the first episode but otherwise, it did not hold my attention"
B007WPLZAK This video\\series, wait I don't know about the entire series, because I could not get through one episode. I have enjoyed many of the series that kindle\\amazon offer, no t this.  Wait is it possible to give a star-?"
B007WPLZAK I just cannot say enough about this series ! It is fantastic ! Great acting , great love story , great ww1 storyline ! Should have a better description ! Highly recommend don,t miss this one !"
B007WPLZAK expected story to be much more real.  male main  actor always seem to be in a daze.  horrible was going on and he 's in dreamland.  I felt like shouting &#34;snap out of it&#34;  didn't enjoy movie at all."
B007WW7GH4 One of the side effects of Amazon instant video, is that if an installment of my guilty pleasure tv program is missed, I can buy it and watch it at my leisure.  And besides, if it is too outrageous to be believed, I can watch it and shake my head in dismay all over again.  This is why I am pleased with the episode availability ofReal Housewives of New Jersey.  I can't believe they are real, but thanks to Amazon, there is solid proof.The quality is excellent, the color is good, and the attitudes and activities are a whole world away from my pleasent, happy, humdrum life."
B007WW7GH4 Theresa and juiced -up (the only way I can fit \"juicy \" into a scenario with her disgusting husband) Joe deserve each other. Sadly, they are raising at least half of their kids to be as ugly and badly behaved as they are. (Audriana and Gabriela so far seem lovely, but they are quieter so it's hard to know -the other two are already apples from the same rotten tree, both throwing Theresa sized fits and saying random messed up mean things about an aunt who has been nothing but sweet to them,  rewarded each time with approving chuckles from their adult role models.) Constantly confusing and reminding everyone of all her \"class \" with designer purses and low rent behavior, accusing two relatives of every sin SHE is guilty of when she would be much better served to imitate everything about Kathy and Melissa to learn what (a) real class is (b) what a good marriage is (never could we imagine Richie or Joey screaming \"shut up \"  (not that we can imagine Kathy or Melissa screech bitching in a manner that would compel their husbands to do this) (c) raising beautiful -inside and out -children through a model of mutual respect and by providing an example to be proud -not ashamed -of. (D) cultivating appreciating and nurturing friendships that are real, as opposed to hanging with someone who might hang \"POSH\" on the door while behaving in a manner more consistent with \"Trash \" or \"I Hang With The Big Boys \".(e) developing a bizarre fixation with others ' real or imagined surgical interventions right after getting her own \"fake bubbies \". The only person meaner and stupider than this woman is her bizarre husband. They are a cautionary tale of what 15 minutes of fame can create, and how essential it is to own what you do and know when to stop pointing fingers or making excuses and just take responsibility and apologize."
B007WW7GH4 Funny,Sad,and Real entertainment reality T.V. I enjoy the drama of it all. Although I wonder if some of the statements are scripted by editors."
B007WW7GH4 Our family loves this show. We ordered the season so our daughters could watch it since they do not have cable at their homes."
B007WW7GH4 I haven't watched the show in awhile.  I just watch the end of the year reviews.  What incredibly stupid people!  Nothing ever gets resolved.  No one changes for the better.  The most ignorant of them all, in my opinion, is Caroline Manzo.  She needs to  learn how to shut up.  I also think that, as imperfect as she may be, Teresa is the most interesting and, in spite of the \"napalm\" error, she is probably the most intelligent of the bunch.  I don't understand why they are all ganging up on Teresa, but perhaps it is all a set up, in which case, we are fools for watching this garbage."
B007WW7GH4 Once you have watched the first three seasons, this 4th season is a must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's complicated relationships that is so fun to watch."
B007Y36DVG A group of paranormal investigators set up in APARTMENT 143, where a man and his two kids have been experiencing bizarre, unexplained occurrences. While not bad, it did tend to lag a bit in the mid-section. The characters were solid, especially the teenage daughter. Still, it felt sort of like one more possession / exorcism movie. If you love the whole PARANORMAL ACTIVITY series, then you'll probably like A143. If not, you might bemoan the existence of yet another \"found footage / shaky-cam\" film..."
B007Y36DVG It could just be me.  I am not a fan of the documentary style films.  I thought the movie dragged a bit and the ending appeared rushed."
B007Y36DVG \"APARTMENT 143\" isn't your ordinary apartment, it dares you to enter, but you may not leave. A young family is terrified by an angry spirit. Therefore, they hire paranormal experts to come in and get rid of the Nightmare. Paranormal activity is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride as you bite your nails waiting to see what happens next. This is a Top Notch supernatural horror that aims to Please! Highly recommended for all paranormal and horror lovers. Haunting from start to finish!"
B007Y36DVG This is one of the best \"paranormal\" films I've seen.  You know along the lines of all the others (and there are many), this one had a story and decent jump factor, eerie and frightening.  Great story line!  Love the actors - spot on!  Held my interest from the first 5 minutes to the last 20 seconds and left me thinking about it long after.  Don't miss this one - it's a WINNER!  So glad I found it."
B007Y36DVG If you ordered this for free on Prime streaming, enjoy the found footage genre and haven't seen any of the Paranormal Activity films, you will probably find this fairly enjoyable. If you paid, don't like this format or have seen some of the others, then maybe not.The production quality is average although the sound could have used a little boost at times. It gets straight into the story without wasting much time on back stories though some of the exposition scenes break the 'found footage' concept and make it drag. There are a couple of solid scares but it's certainly not going to make you sleep with the lights on.This is actually better than Paranormal Activity but suffers from being a copycat - if it had arrived first, I'm sure it would have been received more positively. But as a free rental approaching Halloween, 3 stars is all I can manage."
B007Y36DVG It seems the producers of this may be big fans of the Paranormal Activity series. It starts off slow, doesn't have the movie's title or any credits in the start (or anywhere except the end), and it feels rather standardized.You're immediately introduced to the trio of parapsychologists- a tech expert, the secretary (I'm sorry... \"gatekeeper\"), and the head boss. And they're all in the age ranges and have the looks you would normally expect (with the exception of the tech expert having no glasses for someone who's good with computers).The place that's haunted also has some expected quirks, including the rather standard family- widowed father of a teen daughter and little son. And yes, the daughter hates her dad with a shocking passion while the little boy loves his dad with a passion.The strange happenings come upon rather slowly and, at first, mundanely. When they get revved up by a s&eacute;ance and a hippie-looking channeler, things really get crazy (at times, including a hurricane-force wind within a single room). But, frankly, though I hadn't seen this movie until last week, I do feel like it's too familiar. I feel like I've seen too many visual cousins of this film.There were a couple pretty good shock/jump moments that, though the slow timing/pacing hinted they were coming, still had a good jump factor in them.Then comes the story's twists. One dealing with the spirit of the mother (and why the father says a couple extremely crude things about her, even after his explanations, still leaves me blank in reasoning), and how the parapsychologists review the entire spectacle.Then the ending. After I listened to the whole opinion of the head parapsychologist, it took a bit of time for the last shot to have anything, so I knew there would be one last thing happening. Not only did it happen in a bizarre way, but, in relation to all the things discussed, it proved to be an ironic ending.All-in-all, I'm actually hoping they don't bother making a sequel."
B007Y36DVG A lot of viewers seem to have been nonplussed by this film, and I'm not entirely sure why.  While the &#34;found footage&#34; technique is getting a bit hackneyed, there's still value in it if the director does it right.  And in this case Carlen Torrens seemed to know what he was doing.  (People seem to forget that the style originated with &#34;The Last Broadcast&#34; (1998) and not &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34;, tending to blame the latter instead of the former.)It's not the concept that makes this a really grimy, scary movie, it's the cast of characters Torren brings on board, more specifically two actors who are just generally sinister in whatever roles they play: Michael O' Keefe and Kai Lennox, namely.  O' Keefe looks particularly ghastly in this film as Dr. Helzer (a not so subtle reference to Hanz Holzer, the &#34;parapsychologist&#34; who once channeled the spirit of Elvis and wrote a book about it) as the lighting reflects on his constantly sweaty, angst ridden face.  Kai Lennox absolutely looks like the malevolent dad with some perverse secret, and his meltdown at one point is great acting.Keefe plays the parapsychologist called on by Lennox (Alan White, widower) as he needs assistance with his daughter's strange behavior and a poltergeist phenomenon within the home.  The movie moves fairly quickly from being lighthearted to sinister without skipping a beat.  When the explanations come--a cocktail of mental illness with something else moving around--it is genuinely eerie and packed with atmosphere.  The only huge flaw in this production is the ending shot, which was absolutely cliched and just awful.  Fortunately, that's after all the important elements of the film have occurred.I would recommend this to any fan of the horror genre, despite the reservations that may come from some hasty reviews."
B007Y36DVG I didn't really have high hopes for this apparent Paranormal Activity wannabe since I'm not a fan of camcorder-style horror flicks to begin with, but this didn't even live up to my already low expectations.  The first actor you see onscreen when the movie starts is Rick Gonzalez, who was a regular on the television series Reaper.  I've never seen one of these movies with a recognizable actor before because that ruins the illusion that what you are seeing is real, which is the main point of the camcorder-style format.  But Apartment 143 turns out to be more like a bad episode of Sea of Souls than a Paranormal Activity knock-off, and the camcorder format is basically a misguided and unnecessary gimmick.  The basic premise of the movie is that a team of researchers sets up shop inside an apartment where a family (father, teen-age daughter, young son) are experiencing what appears to be a haunting.  There are phone calls with nobody there and ringing doorbells with nobody at the door and strange noises but even in real life this stuff would be more annoying than scary.  Nothing remotely scary happens in the movie until nearly an hour in.  The biggest problem with Apartment 143, though, is that it has a very lousy script.  The researchers are supposed to be experts in paranormal activity but the idea that a poltergeist might be the issue isn't brought up until nearly two thirds of the way into the movie--but given the presence of an angry teenage daughter in the home that should have been one of the first things that occurred to all three researchers.  Then in an amazingly laughable scene the head researcher suggests that the teen daughter might be suffering from the onset of schizophrenia--because nothing says schizophrenia like furniture flying of it's own accord across the room and characters levitating Exorcist style on their own.  Ugh.  There are a couple of decent shocks involving the daughter but otherwise this movie is a talky and poorly written bore.  I would recommend pretty much any episode of the UK horror series Sea of Souls (which has the same set-up of a trio of researchers investigating possible paranormal activity) strongly over this film."
B007Y36DVG Apartment 143 is a found-footage horror film. The story follows a group of paranormal psychologist as they investigate the White family. The White family has been haunted by an unknown entity in their previous home, and it has followed them to their current apartment. I've seen many found-footage horror films and believe this is one of the better films in the genre.First, the film has a gritty and dark vibe; the cameras used are not high quality, but I feel like that adds to the realism in a positive way. If you're not comfortable with lower quality cameras, then this film probably won't work for you. The crew quickly gets to work and we witness several paranormal events, some have been done before and some haven't. (because some scares are quite original, I highly recommend you avoid the trailers because they do spoil most of them.) The scares work through tension and jump-out scares, like loud noises/loud music, but also some intense physical violence like the vicious levitation scenes. I enjoyed most of the acting in this film, Kai Lennox as Alan White is great; he has some great scenes, including some emotional scenes. I really like the movie's fast pace and excellent use of time; its runtime is only around 1hr 16min, excluding credits, and it packs in so much, and it definitely kills time. Now for the bad: some scares have already been done, and some have been done better; there is a scene where they bring in a psychic, and he suddenly disappears without a trace, which felt a bit awkward, and; the ending was ultimately unfulfilling. On a side note, some of you may hate the daughter because she has a rotten attitude throughout, but I felt the actress did a perfect job portraying the character.Overall, Apartment 143 is better than most found-footage films; it packs some decent scares, some tension, a fast-pace, and great acting. If you already hate found-footage films, this film won't change your mind, though. As of 9/30/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime.Apartment 143 has violence and blood. No sex or nudity.*3.5 rounded up to a 4 for this review."
B007Y36DVG This is not one of my favorite scary movies, because I can't relate to any of the characters, the ghost busters aren't very competent, the university professor in the group who takes it upon himself to figure out what's going on is unbearably self-righteous and just plain wrong, and the last shot you can see coming from a mile away, although that doesn't take away from its creepiness."
B007Y36DVG Do not stretch much sense conclusions. Those fans will find a film mockumentary right, without fail. Even, and as befits the genre, to the proceedings where by some renown actors are credible and accurate.Sorry for my englishRecomended"
B007Y36DVG I love scary movies and this one is another one to add to the to buy list. I'm starting to get out of them more gory junk and really enjoying movies that scare! I recommend this to anyone that likes the kind of paranormal activity type movies. Enjoy!"
B007Y36DVG the story is so cliche; the acting is so rehearsed, forced and unnatural; the banter between the characters is so annoying and stale- I made it 25 minutes before I called it quits.people who've rated this \"movie\" 2+ stars seriously need to have their amazon reviewing privileges revoked!"
B007Y36DVG So, basically it's another kind of \"found footage\" \"ghosts are real\" movie. In this case, a poltergeist, I guess? Of sorts... Not exactly a \"found footage\" movie, per se, since the characters generally survive.Basic premise is that a team of investigators look into paranormal activity at a family's apartment (they moved, and the activity followed them). Weird things go bump in the night, as it were.It was pretty decent. In the end, I don't know that it really amounted to all that much. Par for the course, for the genre, I suppose. It was pretty well-done. I don't know whether all the grain in the movie was real or put in there after the fact. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of all the grain, especially on a large 60\" LCD, via Blu-Ray. But perhaps it was a conscious choice by the the film-makers to lend a certain ephemeral authenticity, rather than shooting all on high-def, reality-perfect 'video' rather than grainy 'film.' Still, I thnk that a well-made story and gripping effects could survive the 'video' problem and still end up with something that looks splendid on Blu-Ray.If you like this flick, I also suggestGrave Encounters(don't know ifGrave Encounters 2) is as good as its forebear or not?"
B007Y36DVG When the film opens sans any title or credits and focuses on a guy adjusting a handheld camera, I'm thinking \"here we go again\" with another low budget \"found footage\" film.  And yes it is and yes there is nothing original here.  And yet...Shot in Mexico with a mostly unknown cast, the film steals the premise of the \"Paranormal Activity\" films and then amps up the ghost factor.  Dr. Helzer (Michael O'Keefe) heads a 3 person team called in to help a desperate father (Kai Lennox) who seems to have a problem with ghosts.  Alan (Lennox) recently lost his wife in a car accident and has a teenage daughter (Gia Mantegna) who blames him.  He also has a young son and is doing his best to move on.When strange things began happening in their previous home the family moved, only to find the spirit(s) followed him.  Helzer's crew set up the requisite cameras in each room then watches the fun begin.  The \"PA\" films use subtle, small creepy moments from hours of film to get the viewers attention.  In this film, you are hit in the mouth with loud noises, violent movement of furniture and wind!  Director Carles Torrens and writer Rodrigo Cortes clean out the apparition handbook and throw the content into the mix.The acting, quite frankly is pretty stiff but I'm not quite sure if that wasn't the idea.  What I mean is that it feels like we are actually just seeing regular people put into a psychological mess.  The movie isn't great and it breaks no new ground.  But for those who enjoy a good fright or two, it might be worth a look."
B007Y36DVG I thought the team of investigators were likeable, the plot interesting and suspenseful and the sort of film noire-grunge Great Recession look effective in setting the mood.  I wouldn't mind seeing the same characters in a sequel on another investigation.  It was actually a pretty thoughtful and psychologically interesting movie.  I'm going to buy it on dvd.  Moral of this movie, teenagers are scary."
B007Y36DVG you ...... will ........... love .......... this .................. item ............ without ......... a ........ doubt ......... I ......... promise ........"
B007Y36DVG The film has some effective moments of tension. However, the filmmakers attempt a backstory explaining the source of the paranormal activity is weak, which is the main failing of the film."
B007Y36DVG The primary problem with the found footage genre is that it blatantly violates the first rule of good storytelling, which is show, don't tell. In my opinion I think this genre has run it's course, it jumped the shark a Paranormal Activity or two back for me.  And I actually fully enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity as well as the underrated The Last Exorcism, at least until it's cop out ending. I even value The Blair Witch Project, more when it was first released than I do today, but it delivered what it promised, which may not have been much, but it delivered none the less.The latest crop of this genre, has nothing new to offer, the only interest can possibly be from people who enjoy the tedium of watching people do tedious things. These movies pretty well offer no surprises, one character in this film even states that he had figured out what was going on the moment that they walked through the door, amen. The jolts come from the surprise sprung on the drowsy half asleep viewer who has an hour in come to except that nothing will happen. I have even fallen pray to that.So is this some deep rooted grudge that I hold against the whole genre that has me lambasting the new flick Apartment 143: not at all. This is a particularly bad example of an all ready dwindling genre that year after year continues to deliver ever further diminishing returns. Apartment 143 is the lamest, worst written and poorest acted that the genre has had to offer, yet.The story has three paranormal investigators, or more accurately as the syfy channel calls them, \"ghost hunters\" setting up cameras to help the White family find out who keeps ding dong ditching their front door. There are, of course, other signs of a ghostly haunting, the usual flickering lights, creaky sounds, prank phone calls, etc.The Whites it seems have suffered a lot lately, other than receiving disturbing phone calls from beyond, they have suffered a family tragedy. The mother of the family died in a car wreck, this leaves dad (Kai Lennox) distraught and guilt ridden, hot teenage daughter Catlin (Gina Mantegna) obnoxious and rebellious, and little Benny (Damian Roman) sad and talking to the ghosts that only he can see; sorry audience, guess we're just left out again.We get to watch father-daughter squabbles, with them and others spouting dialogue that is way too stiff to be spoken by real people. Then something happens, nothing special, but it happened. Finally some pervasive scares scenes, usually punctuated by a shaky camera movement, so that we can't really see anything, but know for sure that it is scary. This all goes on for an excruciating eighty minutes, but you will swear it was much longer. Oh, and the last shot is a total rip-off of the ending to the original Paranormal Activity.Found footage films try to follow in the noble foot steps of the great Val Lewton tradition by being about atmosphere and implication, well they can hope in one hand, and I will let you finish the metaphor. The only scares I get is when I realize that this is not the last of the genre, probably not even the worst: there is said to be a Christian themed film on the way about the horrors of finding some old VHS porno tapes, shriek. Well I guess there is an audience for it, at least we are past the torture porn cycle, but can someone please get back to making decent interesting horror films.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B007Y36DVG I really began watching Apt. 143 with some trepidation since I've seen some pretty bad POV/found footage movies. The &#34;Bake street haunting&#34;, rushes to mind!  This was very different.  We don't have to wait patiently for 90% of the movie before the actions starts, it begins almost straightaway.  The acting is really above par for this sort of movie, although I'm not sure there was enough sympathy for any of the 'haunted' characters, but we're more involved with the paranormal investigators; at least it seemed to me we knew them better and had more insight into them as people than the films victims.  I viewed the father as weak, but then had a change of heart, he was just worn down, tired of dealing with so much drama and tragedy.  Even the strongest can have weak moments.  The children you will decide for yourself, I found the small boy cute and the teenager needing some 'old school' therapy.I loved the 'set', the apartment itself, very cool.  I found myself redecorating, painting and washing windows to the outside and the great french doors.  It was very turn of the century which for some will be creepy, the long, solitary hallway with rooms feeding off of it, the tall ceiling, arched in a few rooms gave great depth and atmosphere.  Everything was just a bit dingy, the wallpaper dated and dirty and the badly 'updated' lighting harsh, so all in all it put you on edge.  I would give the creep factor of this movie a solid 8, a
B007Y36DVG The main problem with Apartment 143 is not the movie itself, but the fact we have been inundated with a host of hand held ghost stories that are \"real\" found footage with actors. The production by itself is decent, but given the fact we have seen it before will cause one to quickly get bored.Three ghost hunters investigate the bizarre events at the apartment of Alan White (Kai Lennox). Paul (Rick Gonzalez) is the technology guy and the one we have to blame for all the cameras. Ellen (Fiona Glascott) is the secretary and assistant but vastly prefers the title \"gate keeper.\" The brains of the operation is Dr. Hezler (Michael O'Keefe). Alan has two children: Benjamin (Damian Roman) who is four and Caitlin (Gia Mantegna) who is at that difficult age. Caitlin has a very cold if not hateful relationship with her father, which immediately makes you think we are headed down the ghost/incest lane, something that has become too much of a substitution for good writing here of late.The mother Cindy has passed on. They believe she is the haunting spirit. Caitlin blames her father for her death.This production is subject to the same criticism of all found film productions. This one experiments with an idiotic head mounted camera that gives the film a \"fish eye\" view. The writing and acting were acceptable \"B\" grade fair. The scare factor was middle of the road. The main problem with this film is that we didn't get to feel for the characters. We got to know about them, but just didn't care.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex or nudity."
B007Y36DVG A team of parapsychologists led by Dr. Helzer (Michael O'Keefe) is hired by Alan White (Kai Lennox), father of two children Catlin (Gia Mantegna) and Benny (Damian Roman). The father, who recently lost his wife, wants the team to investigate strange events that have been annoying him and his children. To do so, the team's technical expert Paul Ortega (Rick Gonzalez) and \"gatekeeper\" Ellen (Fiona Glascott) set up cameras in the apartment rooms that may be haunted.It is unfortunate that \"Apartment 143\" (\"Emergo\") had to be released after the commercial success of \"Paranormal Activity\". The stories are different, to be sure, but each film employs a similar approach to the subject matter. Visually and technically the Spanish film is superb, but devices such as videotaped footage and handheld cameras are no longer refreshing.Don't get me wrong. Slick and fast-paced, \"Apartment 143\" is not boring, and the film provides some good scares. Some characters are interesting, Michael O'Keefe's super-rational doctor, for instance. Carles Torrens (marking his feature debut as director) knows how to scare audiences. Some of the scenes are really scary, effectively tense and creepy.One of the unique aspects of \"Apartment 143\" (written by Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s, director of \"Buried\" starring Ryan Reynolds) is its script that attempts to scientifically explain the supernatural occurrences that haunt the family. It is a nice idea, but the theories and reasoning presented in the film just don't convince.Had the film been released ten years earlier, \"Apartment 143\" would have received more positive reactions. As it is, the film looks familiar and even clich&eacute;d, in spite of s few pretty good scares."
B007Y36DVG This was an excellent movie that offers another explaination for seemingly paranormal events.  It was extremely spooky and violent in nature, I would not recommend it for children.  I don't want to give the movie away so I won't say anymore about it, except that it is good!"
B007Y36DVG i loved this movie....i felt they did a fantastic job with it...it felt real...it kept my interest...it was creepy & had some good \"jump in my seat\" moments....if u liked paranormal activity (1st one) then u will really like this movie........great effects too....and great ending....cant wait to watch it again....and worth the 9.99.......a must see for anyone who likes supernatural movies........."
B007Y36M26 Enjoy the dinosaur picture on the cover as this movie is really aboutanoying people wich will bring you to tears.There is absolutely no good value comming from this movie.The whole movie is seen through a camcorder viewfinder, the the camera girlis very very very annoying....It made me very very happy to throw the disk in the garbage...as i donthave any enemies bad enought that i would give them this DVD."
B007Y36M26 You know, sometimes I wish that the Blair Witch Project was never made. Why? Well, it seems every other movie you see is using the 'found footage' thing. Thing is, nobody is doing anything new with the idea. Some movies would be better off if they weren't like that. Case in point, Area 407. The story is about two sisters who board a plane on New Years' Eve and start filming themselves and the passengers while they're traveling. After the plane crashes in a government testing reserve, the survivors find themselves being pursued by predators that are part of a top-secret government experiment. Taken from their raw footage, AREA 407 explains what happened to them and the other passengers on that fateful night.The story itself is an excellent premise for a movie. The acting was pretty much on par with other movies of this sort. The wounds and gore were very realistic. Heck, even the plane wreckage was realistic. It's when the camera comes into play that killed things off for me. I've seen so many movies of this sort that it ain't even funny anymore. Too, the ending to this movie left me scratching my head and going \"Huh? I just don't get it.\"I love the Jurassic Park approach to the antagonist in the movie but I think it might've faired alot better, moviewise, if they went with a Predator or Aliens one. That's my opinion, anyhow.Don't get me wrong, Area 407 was a pretty decent movie. It was entertaining and exciting. Quite like Apollo 18, it was worthy of a looksee. I just don't know if this would be one that I would purchase and add to my collection. I support low-budget films more than I do the larger budget ones, to be honest, but this is one I'd have to think about before making me a purchase."
B007Y36M26 At the risk of tooting my own horn, I'm comfortable admitting that I'm far more forgiving of these \"found footage\" films than most reviewers.  I've no problem saying that I've enjoyed the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise, even find them modestly creative in their own way.  Also, that APOLLO 18 flick wasn't all that much a failure, certainly not so much as the critics would have you believe.  And, yeah, even THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT had some solid inspiration behind its formula to recreate an episode of `The Twilight Zone' on a very low budget.  And as much as I wanted to give AREA_407 kudos for bringing that unique `found footage' perspective into monster and/or science fiction, I really wish someone would've showed these filmmakers how to use a tripod or a track mount for much of it.See, AREA_407 - for all its strengths - I found very difficult to watch.  The camera's constant bobbing and weaving and shaking and climbing and arcing and dropping became nauseating by the second half.  At 90 minutes, that's a bit too long for the average viewer to stomach without a healthy dose of Dramamine to tide him over.  The chief problem - unlike some of the other forays into `found footage' - is that quite a bit of AREA_407 takes place at night, in very confined settings, and under the tightly focused spotlight beam on a video camera.  You don't have anything to look away at, to momentarily refocus your field of vision, and, as a result, you're forced to concentrate on a screen too intently for too long a time.After boarding a plane on New Year's Eve, two sisters begin videotaping their encounters with fellow passengers.  It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that this plane is going down.  Once on the ground (and for reasons that really defy storytelling logic), the girls continue videotaping their continuing attempts to frustrate those bruised and bloodied around them by capturing it all on videotape.  And, once it becomes clear that they're being hunted one-by-one for what would appear to be dinner by some monster, they still maintain the presence of mind to keep videotaping it all, each and every painful second.  Now, I realize some could make the argument that the girls didn't know the video camera was on - that maybe they were only using it for the light - but the problem that they keep admitting to videotaping EVERYTHING debunks that argument.And that's what's a shame about AREA_407: I really WANTED to love it.  Not only does it have everything a good `found footage' flick should have, it's also composed of equal parts LOST (the TV show) and JURASSIC PARK and CLOVERFIELD.  These folks are trapped - in the dark - and there's a monster out there.  No, they don't quite know what it is, but they see it in fleeting shots of light, and, thus, they can confirm that it's big, it's scary, and it's hungry.  And it isn't going away!  It's an edge-of-your-seat thrill much of the time ... but, creatively, it should've gone the way of `found footage' films like DISTRICT 9 did.  They should've used `found footage' for only the parts of the film that needed it; then, when it became a traditional monster movie, they should've laid the handi-cam aside and used traditional film equipment.  They still could've preserved the `shock' ending by going back to `found footage,' and, in my estimation, they would've had a modest hit on their hands.  All of the right ingredients were here ... they just had them in incorrect amounts.AREA_407 was produced by Suzanne DeLaurentiis Productions and Cloud Nine Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  How does it look?  Well, I think I've covered that in pretty great detail, no?  How does it sound?  For the most part, I had no problem with the audio.  Sure, given the nature of the method the filmmakers decided to tell their story, there's some predictable and deliberate problems with it.  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of on the disc.  Shame on you, filmmakers.  Shame on you.RECOMMENDED with modest reservations.  I'm giving it a solid two-and-one-half stars based on the finished product, but I do so not without warning.  As I've tried to make abundantly clear, this is one of them there \"found footage\" variety flicks.  If you're not into the herky-jerky camerawork, then AREA_407 is probably not for you because the herky and the jerky are front and center throughout all of it.  Still, there's a great story here - with some truly great scares - all given respectable life through the magic of film.  When someone remakes this, let's hope they get it right.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of AREA_407 by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B007Y36M26 This movie brought back memories from a flight I took 20 years ago, from AZ to NY. A 6 hour flight turned into a 21 hour flight, but we got lucky and everyone survived the 'awaiting crash' from icy-weather and faulty mechanics. The devastation of waiting for a plane to crash is something one could never forget. I cannot imagine the Fear of watching the plane go down, not knowing if anyone will survive. In this movie, the plane did go down and the passengers aboard were not so lucky. This is a New Year's Eve to remember as the passengers aboard this flight first discover malfunction through horrifying turbulence, then witness the plane crashing. The crash itself was a Nightmare, but only the Beginning for those who survived as they find themselves running for their lives. An unknown stalker is out there, and the fear becomes terrifying as everyone wonders what is lurking in the shadows. Highly recommended for science fiction, horror, and thriller lovers. The acting is excellent and the story has you on the edge-of-your-seat right to the end as it entertains."
B007Y36M26 ...however, I was pleasantly surprised. I rather enjoy the \"found footage\" genre, but the story lines appear to have been done to death. A documentary crew was filming in an abandoned insane asylum... Yawn... However, when I saw the trailer for \"Area 407,\" the first thing I thought was \"Hey! Not an abandoned asylum!\" The dinosaur in the trailer was a dead giveaway, but still, I held out hope that this wouldn't be, as I mentioned in my subject line, a \"Poor Man's 'Jurassic Park.'\"Well, I can understand my fellow reviewers' frustrations, but I still liked \"Area 407.\" It definitely wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, and for a ScyFy (sp?) flick it wasn't bad. The Charlie character was indeed, as one reviewer put it, a caricature, the typical obnoxious air traveler who paid good money to fly, so damn it, \"I want a drink.\" And one of the main characters, the young Trish, was adorable as can be but quickly became extremely annoying. Still, there was some character development. And I was rather surprised to see the DeLaurentiis name on this film. (Any relation to Dino?)I bought the cheapest copy I could find in order to, uh, minimize the damage in case I ended up hating the movie. I'm happy to say, this was not the case. The \"found footage\" genre will eventually run its course, but until then, I will continue to look for hidden gems among the lumps of coal."
B007Y36M26 Area 407 is a found-footage horror film. A plane crashes in a mysterious area; the survivors are then stalked and attacked by a mysterious predator. The whole situation is documented by two sisters and a fellow journalists (two cameras). I enjoyed the intro and felt it was done well. We meet the characters through some decent dialogue and witness a frightening plane crash (at least for those of us scared to fly). Sadly, the movie goes downhill from here. It uses some very generic found-footage scenes like the shouting exchange found in most: \"Please stop recording! Now is not the time! STOP!\" (then hit the camera and cut out, recording restarts in a new scene). Also, I felt a lot of it was illogical, more than your average horror film. They take an hour to get the first-aid kit after the crash, the U.S. Air Marshall doesn't identify herself for hours after the crash, and the flight attendant and the Air Marshall don't really know what they're doing (aren't there emergency procedures for this instead of sitting around?) For a horror movie, I wasn't really scared, maybe once or twice. It had some tense moments, though. Acting ranged from good to bad. The ending was also decent, but not enough to complete redeem the film completely. It's a time-killer, though.Overall, it's not the worst found-footage film, but it's far from the best. If you're still interested, this film is available on Netflix Streaming as of 9/2/12, I can't recommend paying directly for this film.Area 407 has strong violence and blood (most of the violence is off-screen), no sex or nudity."
B007Y36M26 Utilizing the increasingly popular \"found footage\" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, \"Area 407\" is never particularly effective at establishing its intentions. It's hard to discuss the flaws of the film without revealing too much, so I'll be purposefully vague. The movie charts a plane crash and its immediate aftermath in a desert region of the United States. The survivors of the crash face two imminent dangers (which I won't discuss) but the two threads don't really work well together. As the DVD cover positions the film as a monster movie, I'll say that particular element is handled reasonably well. You get occasional glimpses of the terror, but nothing of a full reveal until the very end. The more human side to the threat is a LOT more vague, unexplained, and frankly lacking in logic. I didn't necessarily hate \"Area 407,\" it just offers little new to this overused film technique. You've seen similar movies and you've seen them better.The movie begins on New Year's Eve as a cross country flight from New York to Los Angles is about to embark. Two young sisters are among the passengers and the youngest is filming everyone in the most irritating way possible. Not to be unkind or personal, but the voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Seriously, I'd have rammed a pencil in my ear if I had been seated next to her. But of course, she is super precious and charming to everyone else and they proceed to treat her like a two year old for the remainder of the picture. The plane crash itself is decent, and I loved the way everyone's head was splattered with massive amounts of bright red blood afterwards. A small band of survivors now must face the ultimate challenge to their survival. Who will make it through the night? What is stalking them? And can anyone help? The movie plays just as you would expect with people dropping like flies.I had two major issues with \"Area 407.\" First, the logic of the \"found footage\" style is never adhered to very well. In one scene, for example, a menacing noise is heard in the woods. The young lady holding the camera never swings around toward the source of the noise like you would in real life, she keeps the shot firmly on the flight attendant's reaction. In a normal chain of events, they'd have been using the light to try to see what was making the noise and the attendant would have screamed \"get that camera out of my face, you bozo, don't you hear that screaming!\" But even more distracting, the film seems to lack a real screenplay (although FIVE people share a story credit for this thin tale). The cast (a couple of which are quite good) seem to be making dialogue up as the movie zips along. Needless to say, quite a few awkward and ridiculous phrases and exclamations are uttered before the night is through. All in all, the entire endeavor feels slight, familiar, and relatively amateurish. My simple wish is never to see another \"found footage\" thriller until someone has something new to offer. \"Area 407\" is not that movie. KGHarris, 8/12"
B007Y36M26 Area 407 is the latest fear filled film from IFC. This low budget, found footage story begins with two sisters boarding a plane from New York to Los Angels. As they do, we are introduced to several of the other passengers who inevitably become mainstays throughout the film. The plane finds it's way into some rough turbulence and with some smooth editing, the flight comes to an abrupt end. The passengers must then work together to try and survive the crash as well as a unknown and very angry monster.This film is a roller coaster of emotions for the audience. The movie starts out a little slow, but quickly picks up the tension as the plane goes down. The suspense builds as the characters run for their life into an abandoned cabin while being chased by something in the shadows. The action starts to get a little repetitive as they keep moving from safe house to safe house. Why they keep going outside when they know something is out there to kill them is beyond me. The questions start to rise again as they find a truck but decide to drive back to the crash site instead of just driving away to safety.The one black eye of the cast was the young girl, Trish, who comes across as very obnoxious in the beginning and doesn't really let up as the film progresses. The rest of the casting was top notch as the actors were believable and had definitely been in films before. I'm sure a lot of the film was improv and the cast did very well in keeping the scene progressing as a number of the takes were many minutes in length.The blood and wounds were very realistic and I must applaud work done on the wreckage of the plane. As for the \"monster\"...I would have rather never even seen a single frame of this mess. I am still boggled by what the filmmakers used as the unknown stalker in this film. This pretty much killed the film for me. The other negative was the twist ending that still has me scratching my head. This scene should have NEVER made the final cut of the film. The reveal of the monster, along with the addition of an unneeded character, left me completely baffled and unsatisfied.Overall, the film is very well paced and edited and the length of shots lasted is very impressive. This found footage film is very well produced and has many bright spots. Although the intrigue takes a nose dive after a while, the begging tension is well worth the watch. If you come across this film and have 90 minutes to spare, keep an open mind check out Area 407."
B007Y36M26 I think the only issue that I have with this movie is that the characters are some of the most suplid ones I have ever seen, speaking and saying nothing but bulls*** and acting as pussies.Other than that the film is pretty intense with good special effects and a twist ending that is trully remarkably frightening.Still, I sugest you better check this one out in Netflix, and if you end up liking it, then buy this disc."
B007Y36M26 Not sure if the other people who left reviews watched the same movie I watched.This movie is excellent for a B movie.  It kept my interest and was totally unpredictable from start to finish.  From looking at the preview, it was a nice surprise to see the ending.  It is worth the time and money to watch this movie. Samantha Lester is a great actor who I hope makes it to the big leagues soon.Also, I really hope this movie gets enough attention and advertising budget that people actually watch it in the theaters..."
B007Y36M26 This is another hand held camera, so it must be real film. Two sisters are flying on New Year's eve from NY to LA. The younger sister Trish (Abigail Schrader) is filming everything which allows some minor character introduction. It was so authentic, it was boring. It just so happens there is a professional journalist on board with a powerful light so he can shoot video at night. His ability to hold the camera still leaves much to be desired.Once the plane crashes (description of film) one passenger Charley (Brendan Patrick Connor) provides for the internal conflict. There is a woman marshal on board (Everette Wallin) so there is someone with a gun. Fear and terror are generated by shaking the camera real fast and having everyone scream and shout at the same time. This worked better than the occasional glimpse of the rubber headed dinosaur looking predator.They crash in the land of &#34;it is always dark&#34; and they keep filming with a light that would attract predators. Everyone has various amounts of bright red blood on them.This movie reminded me of &#34;Chernobyl Diaries&#34; in its basic formula. What you thought about &#34;Chernobyl Diaries&#34; will determine if you like this one. I didn't like the &#34;Chernobyl Diaries.&#34;PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
B007Y36M26 Always hopeful when finding new critter films, I made the mistake of buying into this pile of crap. We all know the SYFY channel is continuing to crank out godawful, unoriginal trash with abandon but even this falls below their \"standards\". The creature \"effects\" may even have been lifted from an old SYFY flick - or a coloring book - not sure ...I gave it a star only because I couldn't submit a review otherwise. My hand shook with the torment of having to do so.Suffice to say, if I were on a desert island with a magical DVD player that worked without benefit of electricity or batteries and only this film to watch, I'd throw myself off the nearest cliff."
B007YNXQXO Good Season!  HD would be a good option, however for the older seasons I can understand if that formatting is not available."
B007YNXQXO I love all the Survivor series. It isn't my favorite season but it is still worth watching. You should check it out."
B007YNXQXO As a new fan of the show Survivor, I love being able to get past seasons that I missed. I hope Amazon gets more of the older seasons soon. I want to buy them all! They never disappoint!"
B007YNXQXO I can never get enough of this show.my only wish is that Amazon offered all of the seasons."
B007YNXQXO The video streaming quality remained at \"very poor\" throughout this viewing of the first episode of this season, greatly diminishing the experience.  It was as though I had smeared Vasoline all over my screen and then tried to view it.  Usually, the quality starts at very poor but after a couple of minutes it improves suddenly--not so this time.  My DSL speed is 15 mps and usually allows excellent streaming quality so the culprit seems to be Amazon's server.  What recourse does one have when this happens?"
B007YP4ZLY I guess the main character on this show is a celebrity from Survivor.  Who knew?!?  Most often than not, there is more drama than flip.  I've seen 4 episodes, and I still cannot remember the names of these guys.  That's how insignificant they are to me (as celebrities).  Anyway, these two guys (who are brothers), are always at each other's throats.  Seriously, it's a constant battle between them.  Sometimes, the battles are entertaining.  Sometimes, just annoying.  In the middle of all this noise, is a renovation.  Because of all I just mentioned, I would give the show 1 to 2 stars.  But because I'm in it for the education, I can honestly say there are a few things I've learned about flipping houses.  Thus, I give the show 3 stars.  Like I said, I've watched several episodes to see what happens next, so there is something to it that keeps me coming back.  Maybe it's the super hot realtor that keeps me coming back for the next episode?"
B007YP4ZLY This show features two brothers who flip houses for profit in the Houston, Texas area.  Some viewers may recognize one of the brothers as Russell Hantz, one of the most-hated men on the reality show, Survivor.  Russell's brother, Shawn, seems to be a lot more level-headed and likeable.I'm honest enough to admit that I first started watching this show hoping to witness Russell fail.  But over time, I'm beginning to like him a wee bit more as I realize that he does genuinely care for his family members.Regardless, I still get a little satisfaction from seeing Russell stuggle (which he often does on this show) and even better is when he has to admit that he is wrong, which he does not do quickly, easily, nor often, but I've seen it a time or two now.Between the details of the houseflips, the things that go wrong, the inter-sibling rivlary, and Russell's crazy antics (in one episode, he shoots up his own house with a shotgun), this show is one wild ride!If you love to hate Russell as much as I do, try this show out!"
B007YP4ZLY I was hoping is was more like &#34;flip this house&#34;, and was disappointed.  Mostly arguing with family members and not really showing great success with the home."
B007YP4ZLY This show is very interesting dynamic between Russell Hantz' working and his family life. In this season Russell calls 3 contractors to do his floors of his house and has a bidding war. He saves 1500 to 2000 dollars and he makes the contractors really angry. He also almost gets arrested for pushing a cop because someone has stole his lumber he was going to use for a deck. Russell goes into one of his houses and finds a raccoon, so he goes out to his car and picks up a shotgun and starts shooting inside of his house. Shawn, Russell Hantz brother is supposedly 50/50 with Russell on the flipping house business. Shawn always screws something up and Russell has to pay for it. Russell makes one mistake and buys a really bad house that is flawed and costs him a lot of money. Boo from Survivor Fiji, makes an appearance and helps Russell buy a house. This is a great season you should buy it if you are a fan of Russell Hantz or flipping houses."
B007YP4ZLY I started watching this because I like this sort of program (DIY, flipping, real estate rehab).....but I continued to watch it because these guys are hilarious. They....sort of know what they are doing, but the egos usually manage to undo any of that, which is pretty entertaining. Not four stars because it comes off more like comedy/reality that DIY - which is what it was grouped with."
B007YQ5D8M American Experience series was very educational and entertaining.  We highly recommend it!  We looked forward to watching it each night."
B007YQ5D8M What an example . . . Jesse Owens gave the better part of his life to sports. His contribution  and performance in the 1936 Olympic Games gave a negative definition of what had become Nazi Germany. At what cost?Well documented, accurate and heartbreaking. To his credit, he offered a way to integration that was unsurpassed at that time. He chose to be a 'gentleman' and a man of honor. Again, another exceptional presentation from The American Experience . . . narration, interviews and original footage combine to offer accurate information. If you don't know about his courage, please listen and learn!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -What about Grand Coulee Dam? The enormous scale of Grand Coulee dam was without precedent and presented far more difficulties than Hoover Dam. What was gained and what was lost with the building of the dam?  Tremendous destruction of the environment and the displacement of the Native American culture. Looking forward, the dam proved to be of major importance with the advent of WWII. The agricultural significance and the ability to provide electricity changed the Northwest . . . perhaps one needs to ask at what cost. Well documented and certainly a terrific addition to The American Experience."
B007YQ5D8M This is one of the best shows on PBS and if you like to know about the history of some of the variety events you will love this show."
B007YQ5D8M Wish I learned history this way since film footage shows a little more truth than an opinioned author.  Never gets dull"
B007YQ5D8M I enjoy documentaries very much. PBS and American Experience  have fascinating programs. This season was short but I enjoyed the program on &#34;Jesse Owens.&#34;  He is a national, Olympic, and personal hero. I recommend it."
B007YQ5D8M This Volume of The American Experience contains the chapters on Jesse Owens and the Grand Coulee Dam. Both are well done and informative. The documentary on the building of the Grand Coulee dam not only looked in considerable detail about the politics and construction of the project but also looked deeply into the ramifications of this massive effort. Without supplying their own conclusions, the program raises the unsettling prospect that no major change in the  environment (such as this) is either all good or all bad. The program supplies information and leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Overall, good food for thought."
B007YZ29U8 I have learned so much from the series, The Universe. It has the latest accepted theories regarding the history of the solar system, planet Earth, the Milky Way Galaxy, and beyond."
B007YZ29U8 Despite the occasional re-use of concepts and footage, they always manage to find some new approach to the concept and visuals to keep this a vibrant, informative show."
B007YZ29U8 A great show with nice visuals...I am a science teacher and I even have learned a thing or two from it."
B007YZ29U8 This season is filled with too much speculation and leaves one feeling less than satisfied by asking more questions than it cares to answer."
B007YZ29U8 It seems like every season covers a lot of the same observations.  That said, I really do not care.  It is a very informative series, and I like every single episode.  I give it a 4/5 simply because it is not the most entertaining show.  It has a lot of slow moments.  I often think they over-dramatize the facts and use too much time to explain certain things.  There is also not a lot of referencing going on during each episode.  They interview many of the same people in each episode, and those people do not show much evidence to support what they think is happening out there, in The Universe.  See what I did there?  Heh.I will say this, however:  I used to love this show in season 1.  It did not seem as long and drawn out back then.  I would give season 1 a perfect score, but later seasons have proven to be a little more drawn out and just do not seem to have as prominent of a purpose as season 1.  Later seasons, including season 6, are still very entertaining and still informative, but I just seem to be losing interest in this show."
B007YZ29U8 + Good production quality+ Great effects+ Decent narration.- The only thing it lacks is science. They make reference to it and every now and then, they mention some specific examples."
B007YZ29U8 If you are very new to the topics you may enjoy this series. And although there are some tiny portions of genuinely new and informative content, it is too little and too infrequent. It is frustratingly condescending and even silly at times for those who are familiar with the topics. None of the episodes are worth watching for veterans of these sorts of documentaries except perhaps the \"Is there a God\" episode.The \"Is there a God\" episode is surprisingly less condescending. The vocabulary is not dumbed down at all and the there are only a couple silly sidebar explanatory analogies. But the approach to the topic is brazenly insensitive, arrogant and potentially offensive to just about anyone who adheres to a religious Faith.From that episode, it looks like Stephen Hawking has chosen to join the \"there is no god\" crowd."
B007YZ29U8 It is a shame, very interesting topics, dumbed down to the lowest common denominator (a retarded grain of sand). Science is interesting, you don't have to create all of this fake drama, & use flashy editing techniques to try to make people think it is exciting."
B007YZ29U8 This series never ceases to amaze.  Full of info, it is presented in an easily understandable way, but not dumbed down too much.  The graphics are stunning."
B007YZ29U8 It is something I don't mind him watching even though it is probably way too advanced for him. I am interested too and find myself watching more than I imagined I would when we put it on."
B007YZ29U8 Trying to wrap my feeble mind around the concepts presented in this show was a challenge. It would have been helping to give more examples of the size of things involved to grasp the whole picture. Not that this wasn't full of information that made me feel smarter just by watching, but it was like getting hit with a firehose of information."
B007YZ29U8 This entire series is without equal for those who are either &#34;into&#34;, or just want to learn more about our place in all this!  The only problem I have is that there aren't more seasons/episodes available..."
B007YZ29U8 Truely educational and entertainment tv.  I watch these over and over mind blowing stuff. Space is our future if we have a future."
B007YZ29U8 This show is so cool. Great for all ages. You can watch an episode over and over and get more out of it."
B007YZ29U8 Really enjoyed Universe. I have always been a space nut. This is really fun to watch. I've seen it on TV and just have to watch it again and again."
B007YZ29U8 We enjoyed this series due to it's quality scripts, and photography. This is basic science but at a level which should be of interest to all age groups. We don't think that you'll be disappointed."
B007YZ29U8 This program makes you think about how our world began and what may lie ahead for us. Great for students of all ages."
B007YZ29U8 Brilliant simulations and great footage from NASA make this series a must watch for astrophysics fans or folks that like science presented in an entertaining way."
B007YZ29U8 I learned a great deal because this series presents the most current research into this fascinating topic. I'm watching the whole series."
B007ZF1JW6 alot of people are into this show and e-mail back and forth-this and the green lantern shows are two of the best on t.v"
B007ZF1JW6 I was enjoying the suspense and the drama of the series but disappointed it stopped at episode 7.  What a cliffhanger 7 episodes for the season 2.  I wanted more."
B007ZF1JW6 Just heard this show is NOT getting picked up for a 3rd season.HUGE mistake Cartoon Network.Hands down, THE BEST ANIMATED SHOW ON TV TODAY!!!!"
B007ZF1JW6 Young Justice is one of the best animated series that I have ever watched. Some people were confused and/or disappointed with the direction that the second season took, but since it was pretty apparent that it was going to be the last, they took some chances and changed things up. It doesn't take long to figure out what's going on, and what happened since the first season. The tone of the show is still the same as it always was."
B007ZF1JW6 The \"new\" Young Justice is still going strong. For those who are bugged about M'gann and Conner's breakup, don't worry - we finally get a few answers about that, though not all of them. The details we do get are rather unexpected. Let's just say that M'gann is no longer the sweet, naive little girl she was in Season One. Also, we learn more about Garfield Logan's transformation into Beast Boy, cleverly linked to the rest of the series' mythology in a new origin story partially revealed in the Season One episode \"Image\". (Watch that one before this, if you haven't already.) The same typically brilliant Young Justice treatment is given to the character of Adam Strange, who gets some great development here. Finally, we get an exciting lead-in to next week's episode at the end which promises answers to yet more of Season One's questions. Still no mention of our missing team members, however: Artemis, Kid Flash, and Aqualad. I hope they don't leave us hanging too long on that one."
B007ZF1JW6 Love this show....was a little taken back by the time leap, but will give it a chance...where is artemis?  Missing her!"
B007ZF1JW6 The second season shows the kids all grown up.  It is a little confusing especially when you see 3 batmans or 3 flashes.  Was kinda hard to tell who was who from the first season."
B007ZF1JW6 Young Justice does an especially excellent job of linking all aspects and characters of the DC Universe.  Although Young Justice is not my favorite DC show, this episode was excellent."
B007ZF1JW6 A normal day at Mount Justice for Knightwing, Robin and Beast Boy gets strange when a strange teen emerges from a machine that just suddenly appears. He is Bart Allen, the Grandson of Barry Allen The Flash from fourty years in the future. He claims to be a tourist but he actually has an ulterior motive behind his Trek to the past."
B007ZF1JW6 first its the superman cartoons, then batman the animated series, then spiderman in the 90's that series, then the hulk, then something new batman beyond then static shock new heroes new shows coming on tv...but then finally there was the Justice League which was pretty much the best show at that time for me when it came out and nothing after that really got my attention like that.Teen titans was cool but as I was getting older I didn't really like sidekicks too much anymore, or young heroes like that except for spider man and nightwing really.Now seeing this, Young Justice, they got Nightwing, Red-Arrow, like side-kicks but a better sidekick show then teen titans you know,  each one is like a hero and all working under or sometimes with the justice league and you always see a great variety of characters which is the best part. No idea why there isn't season 3, this was really the only show I actually watched the entire season rather then just a few episodes that looked cool."
B007ZF1JW6 This was a great show!! The writing was great. Keeps you guessing as well as good development of each of the heroes.Action was great but not senseless. The fights were well done and placed in their proper form. This show won multiple Emmy awards... and they cancelled it because of low toy sales!!! Are you kidding me? Bring them back!!"
B007ZF1JW6 Hands down the most enjoyable and exciting cartoon series Ive ever watched.. Great stories.. Great characters... Cant wait to watch the rest of it!!"
B007ZU23GC We love to watch this show. It is like the adult version of America's Funniest Home Videos. Better host &  funnier videos!"
B007ZU23GC I've been watching him since rob&big, and it's the funniest show ever. i love it."
B007ZU23GC I know that title seems a little dumb but it is only because my I.Q. points definitely take a hit while watching this show.  Sorry but I like it any way.  Seems a little devious to be cheerful about other peoples misfortunes.  Sorry but it is funny sometimes"
B007ZU23GC This show is a blatant rip off of Tosh.0. And this show is just not as funny personally. I could not get into it, his show with his bodyguard was probably the best. He has tried to branch off into too much and it just isn't as good."
B007ZU23GC I discovered this show through Prime and was delighted- I haven't watched anything on MTV since college in the early 00s, so I didn't even know this existed. Having sat through countless ours of &#34;fail&#34; videos on YouTube, I'd thought I'd seen them all.I was wrong.But the videos are only a portion of what makes this show great- Dyrdek and company's commentary is fantastic and usually funnier than the videos themselves. I don't usually 'marathon' shows, but I watched most of the first season in one sitting over a holiday weekend.I regret nothing."
B007ZU23GC This is an entertaining show. If you have seen any other shows like it, it is the same. Some of the videos are painful to look at, so if you are squeamish don't watch."
B0080CK0O6 The story line is a bit confusing at times, but I enjoyed watching it.  It takes a while for me to get used to the British English."
B0080CK0O6 These shows are much better than the standard U.S. crime shows.....they're grittier and more interesting. Less &#34;glam&#34; and formula driven. Highly recommend it.."
B0080CK0O6 It is hard to keep a top flight thing going. Some of the episodes here were not up to the level of the first 3 seasonbut still very good. Don't miss it!"
B0080CK0O6 Commander is a great show in the vein of trial and retribution,  prime suspect, vera and single handed. well thought through."
B0080CK0O6 I love British dramas and crime tv. Please make more of them available for free video streaming for prime members."
B0080CK0O6 Another different but interesting series from our sister country across the pond. Comparable to &#34;Prime Suspect&#34; with Helen Mirren. This series is another fascinating look at British crime, legal system and the lives of the female high command."
B0080CK0O6 The series which has so much going for it -- great writers, wonderful acting (Amanda Burton is so good) but it can't seem to decide what it wants to be -- a gritty, police procedural wrapped around a complex character or a light somewhat humorous, almost US style (think Castle, etc) detective series. I want it to be more of the former. This season seems to be more of the latter, the cases are somewhat inane and Commander Blake is no longer the tough, conflicted police professional."
B0080CK0O6 This series is gripping, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The main character is one you can identify with and yet has qualities I don't have, but admire.  Secondary cast, writers and director and absolutely the best."
B0080CK0O6 she tries to be so hard and yet her soft inner self seems to come out without being sappy.  But if I were her I would slap some of the male colleagues around a bit."
B0080CK0O6 She lives the life of a man personally and professionally...the morals of an alley cat probably helps her fend off the male prejudices of the police command/upper-echelon who know she is good in her job...most of the time...but still don't like her."
B0080CK0O6 fabulous....British TV and Movies seem to carry a better story line than shows done here in the US and that is a sad thing.  But I did love The Commander"
B0080CKV72 It's true that I love Asylum Blackout, but it's not without several very noticeable faults.  I'm sure I'm forgetting several in my review.  For one, it takes forever for the movie to get going and once it *does* get going, it feels like it ends way too soon.  Also, the employees that work at the asylum are suspiciously unarmed and defenseless for some bizarre reason, which doesn't make sense given the psychotic nature of the inmates.  This also doesn't make sense since the guys that work there are more like clueless punks only there to cook meals for the inmates, at least, that's the initial impression.  This makes you think it's not necessary to really care about their fate when the time comes (and trust me, you know it's coming- it's only a matter of when).I mean *every single one* of the dangerous criminals are completely psychotic and beyond the point of being unreasonable, so they obviously have nothing to lose.  Under these conditions, you'd need the best kind of protection available to assure your safety but... apparently not in this asylum.  Strange.Obviously the inmates were made so psychotic for the purpose of delivering a suspense/horror movie.  Regardless of these issues, the final 30 minutes is pretty darn entertaining.  This is when the employees basically spend their time tucking and hiding under tables and inside storage rooms, and anywhere they can just to escape the army of crazy criminals released after a blackout locks everyone inside.  These bad boys are motivated to destroy as much of the asylum as possible... and that's another flaw.  Wouldn't you want to capture and kill the employees if you're an asylum?  After all, you'd want to get rid of anything that could possibly stand in the way of your persuit of escaping.  Then again maybe the inmates intention was never to escape after all and just go crazy on everything around them?I have to ask, who in their right mind would EVER create an asylum under these conditions?  The electric goes out, all criminals are released?  It's hilarious to think such a scenario is possible. Also, the segments involving a phone hitting the head of one of the main characters and still working perfectly fine... and later the phone call to the cops where the cop for whatever reason doesn't seem interested or lacks the proper attention span to understand a man CLEARLY and desperately explaining the emergency situation over the phone... a typical trait of horror movies is to be totally clueless and lack logic on the part of the helpful folks, of course.  Can't have the good guys making an easy escape can we?  These are all flaws that should have been changed before the movies release in my opinion.However I still firmly stand behind my 5-star rating.  The final 30 minutes drastically picks up concerning the entertainment level as violent deaths occur one after another, along with people getting burned, tortured, stabbed and even decapitated.  All wonderful additions to a horror movie and totally appropriate for a movie about inmates escaping and running wild.  The atmosphere is decent towards the end too, especially when the employees run for their lives only to reach a dead end on a couple occasions.  A feeling of dread and concern for their safety occurs for you the viewer, which is a beautiful piece of writing and even looks frightening on TV.Great movie, regardless of the weak low budget acting and the hit or miss storytelling that takes a while to get underway.  Also regardless of that one song that plays a couple times (most notable during the credits) that sounds like it's copying the mid 70's period of the Kinks directly (and I KNOW it's ripping off another 70's song too- if only I could figure out which one, hmmm).  I highly recommend this movie, but don't expect anything greater than typical Hollywood exaggerated suspense.  Do NOT expect a bunch of logical situations either."
B0080CKV72 Note to Hollywood and beyond: I've really grown tired with trick endings.  It isn't that I don't like then because, frankly, I do.  It's that most of them aren't done all that well any longer.  As a matter of fact, once you know you're trapped inside a motion picture that undoubtedly will have a trick ending (the first giveaway is that you can tell one's coming), then you begin w-a-t-c-h-i-n-g the film yet you stop watching the story.  You find yourself glancing at shadows.  You listening for verbal clues to secret identities or dropped Easter eggs.  You're seeing that body over in the corner of the screen, and you're wondering, \"Hey, why is it the director never shows me who that dead guy is over there?\"  At that point, it's stopped being a legitimately entertaining experience and started being an exercise in cognitive reasoning ... and that's not the reason I spun the disc in the first place!(NOTE: the following review will contain spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're comfortable with a few hints of `things to come,' then read on ...)George (played nicely by the reliable Rupert Evans) is a down-on-his-luck musician who - in order to make ends meet - takes a job as `chef' at the local insane asylum.  (Where did he get such a romantic background and why is it he can only find a job cooking at a virtual prison?  Ah, ah, ah!  Don't start looking so closely so soon, viewer!)  In order to make his existence a bit more palatable, he somehow manages to have all of the members of his band also hired at the said institution.  (Wait a minute ... how exactly does that happen?  Ah, ah, ah!  I warned you about thinking too much about the plot!)  But before you can say `twaddle,' a freak electric storm knocks out all power to the normally secured building (AND the back-up generators?!?!), and George and his friends are left locked behind bars with time running out on their own sanity as the inmates seize control!  (Well, how in the Sam Hill is that even remotely ... FOR THE LAST TIME, DIDN'T I WARN YOU TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT?!?!)ASYLUM BLACKOUT didn't make much sense from the get-go, but, to its strengths, it's certainly grounded in some solid work by all the players, a wonderfully moody atmosphere complete with all of the usual `locked box' scenarios, and some fine dark'n'gritty filmmaking.  Were that enough, I'd probably be willing to give it more than a respectable two-and-one-half stars (most of which is solely for some solid technical and acting prowess); but, sadly, all of it revolves around a central conceit of the trick ending.  I couldn't tell you exactly when I started to suspect exactly \"What\" was going on - it's fairly predictable as a trick ending, I might add - though, based on my description of the plot, methinks you can tell it was early on.Narratively, it is structured very well.  It's a tidy 90 minutes, broken into clear thirds like a classic three-act play.  The first 30 minutes is set-up of all the players; the second 30 is when the black-out occurs and everything goes downhill fast; while the final 30 clearly begins pointing toward the ruse you'll probably see coming.  Suffice it to say, folks aren't exactly what they seem ... but the critical failure of the particular subterfuge of S. Craig Zahler and Jerome Fansten's script is that, by the final third, there's no room left for subtlety.  What should play out as mind games end up being something fairly close to torture porn - a plot device used way too frequently in horror films these days.To further beat the dead horse, the dodge they use makes little sense to the chronology of the film: the final moments are a book-ended revisitation of the picture's opening segment, forcing you - the viewer - to suddenly realize what you may have just seen may, in fact, NOT be what you just saw.  While others might find this `genius' or `groundbreaking,' I found it more than a bit fraudulent.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  It's probably a one-off picture for most people (meaning it's worth a single viewing).  The ultimate problem with ASYLUM BLACKOUT isn't in its performances or execution; rather, it's in its conception.  Given the nature of the story - think of a really good episode of `The Twilight Zone' that went too far - is that once you know the ending, you have to re-evaluate everything you've seen heading up to it.  When you look too closely at the seams, then suddenly you realize you're W-A-T-C-H-I-N-G a movie instead of being immersed in one - the way you are a really good book.  Instead of enjoying it, you realize that you've been duped - and not in a good way - only now you've wasted the last 90 minutes and can't get `em back ... which is kinda/sorta like what happens to George."
B0080CKV72 Opening credits lists an asylum in Washington State as the source and the date  of 11/6/89 of this patient breakout - sorry, despite the docudrama feel it never happened on that or any date and for that matter in any state. Our Belgium \"Tax Shelter for Films Investing\" studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale. As for the script it's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly \"no way out\" trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it's a rock band group (How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once?) having to defend themselves. The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood. You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff (sort of since the lights were mostly out) to last through this one. The whole production seemed cheap. Must not be a lot of investors (they actually listed their names) seeking some tax sheltering."
B0080CKV72 George and his fellow bad members pick up small gigs at night, while working at the asylum during the day. As cooks fot the criminaly insane, it is their job to prepare and serve the food for the inmates. With a less than ideal job, the group is hoping to make it big sometime soon and leave the asylum for good. Unfortunatly for them, the inmates have other ideas.As a giant thunderstorm rolls through the town, the power at the asylum goes out. The lights don't turn on, the security doors are useless and the phones are dead. Reluctant at first, the cooks decide to restore order and bring the wandering inmates back to their cells. George and his friends soon realize the inmates my be insane, but they are not stupid. With an almost methodical plan of attack, the prisoners slowly begin to take over the darkened asylum. Armed with whatever they can find, the criminaly insane hunt down the gaurds and cooks, all while inflicting some serious pain.T
B0080CKV72 A very low budget movie but quite good. The violence is over the top and way beyond anything I have ever seen. Similar to the zombie movies but with severely mentally ill patients. The ending can be a copy of Shutter Island or maybe not."
B0080CKV72 [BEWARE: The following review of \"The Asylum Blackout\" contains minor spoilers.]The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In \"Asylum Blackout\" (aka \"The Incident\") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?\"Asylum Blackout\" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing."
B0080SSSJ4 This is a badly made movie. Bad story, bad plot and terrible acting.It amazes me that movies this awful actually get made and distributed."
B0080SSSJ4 Would be better ranked at 2.5 stars. Laughably over the top, but played straight and with total sincerity. There is something almost endearing about this low budget (and confusing) demon horror that somehow keeps it just on the side of watchability"
B0080SSSJ4 Sometimes a bad movie is so bad it redeems it's self by just being campy fun.  This movie doesn't.  It's just bad in a boring, low budget way with no entertainment."
B0080SSSJ4 Not worth a rental, not worth the time I spent watching it free as an Amazon Prime member. Just awful. Juvenile directing, poor cinematography..........just poor..........dreadfully poor"
B0080SSSJ4 Now I know that anyone can make a movie.  The grainy black and white filming was interesting, and really didn't add to the movie.  It's like they said &#34;We'll save money if it's not in color&#34;."
B0080SSSJ4 On a budget, but it does not show much.  Very good story and acting.  Watched the whole movie in one sitting.  Enjoyable.  Good old fashion horror story.  Again, well done, and worth watching."
B0080SSSJ4 ONE GREAT THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A &#34;FOUND FOOTAGE&#34; MOVIE!Filmed with grayscale effect and at some scenes it will go into full colour. Yes, it will go into full colour especially on those scenes that has upper body nudity. In terms of demon characteristics of the characters, I find it weird how a succubus is portrayed in the film. Succubus does not make a dead person comes alive!Exorcism does not work as it is portrayed in the movie. Demons don't die. It can only be banished. And you have to make the demon tell you its name to banish it.The following are what I found good in the movie:-Audio overlay throughout the movie-Yay! Not one of those handheld camera movies :DThe following are what I found to be no good in the movie:-How the story escalated-Lack of research regarding demons and spirits-Sexual scenes are the &#34;honey trap&#34; of the movie; you don't need those scenes in a good horror movie!-Please stick to one video format; either grayscale or colour but not both!"
B0081FD7BA Stan Lee is the man. I love all and every character he has created but spider-man is my ultimate favorite. this is a documentary of stan the man lee. one of comics most awesome and famous creators. this is a great documentary and everyone who is a fan of comics or superheroes should see this movie. this is a awesome film. I don't think the world would be the same if he did not come along. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do"
B0081FD7BA I believe that this film did an excellent job of answering a question that a number of people have been asking for years: Who is Stan Lee? While he has been accused by numerous detractors of being in the spotlight more often than he should have been and they've expressed alot of anger about the lack of credit artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko received over the years as a result, in this film and in any forum where he had a chance to express his views, Stan \"The Man\" Lee never stopped giving credit to the talented people who drew, inked, lettered and performed numerous tasks that made Marvel the most popular comic book company in the country if not the world!While I would have liked to have seen more video clips of his past interviews (he once appeared on The Mike Douglas Show wearing a Captain America costume without the skull cap because the wings fell off before he appeared on-camera and he didn't want to misrepresent the character), I enjoyed this look into The Man Behind The Myth and I look forward to the release of the DVD so that I can see if there are any special features that couldn't fit into the film proper.Excelsior!"
B0081FD7BA WITH GREAT POWER (a/k/a WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY, 2010, 80 minutes, for Epix Channel) was one enjoyable, fun documentary. It is the story of Stan Lee, born Stanley Lieber, the Brain Behind Marvel Comics. In my estimation, he along with his three trusted artists IS Marvel Comics.Told entirely by Stan himself, in mostly modern interviews and some footage from older appearances, this really covers all bases I wanted to know about him. I have read two forgettable biographies, and saw one other documentary about him - and they were all lousy. Maybe that's just me but this documentary is the one to see, the only one.With great power, as Stan learned early, comes great responsibility. Even in documentaries, perhaps most especially in documentaries. There are important appearances/commentaries here from luminaries such as Nicholas Cage (who calls Stan \"a father figure\") and Patrick Stewart (who, like me, thinks Stan is greater than Shakespeare).I have this rotten feeling I was cheated by the version I watched, because there are lots of credited no-shows, like one of my favorite actors, Thomas Hayden Church and one of my favorite directors, Roger Corman. Can't imagine where these boys got off to - and Nicholas Cage isn't much of an addition to the facts presented here: he gets about a minute of face time and part of that is a filmed spontaneous encounter he has with Stan someplace.More than compensationary are the moments such as Stan sneaking up on Robert Downey who is attending to some adoring fans - he turns, sees Stan and says, \"I'm too famous for YOU!\"To which Stan loudly yet sweetly says, \"You're damn right you are!!!\" as he gives Downey a big hug that is fiercely returned. But that's not why I love this documentary. This is a special work, dedicated to Lee's life, accomplishments and his newer endeavors. It does not dwell on the painful (one being the lawsuit over the movies being made and Stan being cut out of the process entirely).Instead, it reminded me of my youth, when Stan's comics were fresh and the world was abuzz with him and his work. In those days, suffice it to say Stan Lee was, for my generation, a little comparable to God. Except we knew if we wrote to Stan, HE just might answer. We knew he existed and we even thought one day we might get to meet him and a few of the artists who drew the comics.The importance of Stan Lee, that causes me and Patrick Stewart to say he is greater than Shakespeare, is not only his writing and other genius - it is his deep understanding of human pain, our pain, his own pain. It is his ability to take pain and spin it into the purest gold there is. This documentary concentrates on that, and may I add it is an invaluable resource to track exactly what (and when) Stan accomplished such great work for this world.It really matters little who you are: you have to get this. If you're expecting Hollywood gab and 'insider' peeks at the Marvel films or Stan's production company works, not much is here. If you just sit and enjoy, I promise it will teach you more than just the meaning of real power.Stan Lee himself will teach you why it is that with great power comes great responsibility, and he'll show you how he made it his life's theme."
B0081FD7BA The thinking man's comic books that were the Marvel brand, featuring titles such as THE FANTASTIC FOUR, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, came to be thanks largely to a gentleman known as Stan Lee.  Those who don't realize Marvel's contribution to popular culture should see the 2013 documentary WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY.  Those who do have probably already seen it; certainly the film's tone does not fall short in presenting fans who praise Marvel writer-editor Lee.But I'd rather appreciate WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY for its strengths, first and foremost that it shows comic books are not necessarily just a part of childhood culture, something that has to end when a kid moves on from superheroes to, say, MAD magazine.  While not the sole example, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN's adaptation into several successful motion pictures and, most recently, a Broadway musical stands as strong support of that notion.Age 53 as I write this, I realize that the poorly made cartoons based on Marvel Comics in the 1960s reflected a cheap cash-in on the brand's popularity but the first-rate motion pictures - most recently, IRON MAN, starring one of film's premiere actors, no less - live up to the spirit of Stan Lee and his collaborators because the filmmakers were the ones who bought those comic books when they were children."
B0081FD7BA Stan Lee has alternately been reviled and revered for his contributions to the comic world. Now in his 90s, Stan Lee uses this documentary to be surprisingly frank about what happened, what didn't happen, and share his side of the story amidst rumors of bankruptcy, his failure to share credit with other creators, and his legacy as an author.Lee makes a point of emphasizing that he is a writer -- not a comic book artist -- which is noteworthy in itself.  Authors have slowly become more prominent in the world of comics, but it's easy to understand how fans have often conflated Lee's legacy as a \"creator\" with actually drawing the comic.  This has serious implications in determining who actually created Spider-Man and other iconic superheroes Lee helped invent -- it was almost always a group effort between the artist and author.  Whether or not Lee gave credit where credit is due is moot now -- he makes it clear, complete with signed letters, that he feels that the accolades should be shared.  Lee is one of the few creators still living, and thus is the beneficiary of the comic creator legacy simply by outliving his peers.In the early days it's clear the comic book industry was a haphazard affair, and Lee survived a series of turbulent changes due to his tenacity and charm.  He is dogged in producing ideas -- many of which, it's clear in his later years, weren't always good -- but he sells them with such affable charm that even his bad ideas are hard to resist.  In a nascent comic book industry, Lee threw everything at comics and used what stuck.Lee's most important contribution is likely his insistence that superheroes have normal, everyday problems.  In the world of grim-and-gritty Batman it's hard to imagine a world that isn't grounded in reality, but back when Lee entered the comic book industry Spider-Man's issues with his girlfriend and family were novel.  Lee's humanity -- shared in touching detail by his wife's travails with childbirth -- shaped the heroes we know today.It's also easy to see how Lee might overshadow other creators.  Like Gary Gygax of Dungeons & Dragons, Lee was a showman who loved his soapbox, and moved to Hollywood to continue the natural evolution of his brand from comics to television.  He had mixed success, but making the jump to cartoons introduced legions of fans (me included) to Marvel characters and Stan Lee's voice introducing each show with breathless wonder.Lee's legacy is no longer extricable from the evolution of comic books.  As a man, Lee has some obvious flaws, but it's thanks to him -- and the other creators he mentions in passing -- that we have the comic books of today.  This is perhaps Lee's final soap box, and it's a fine conclusion to a great story.  He's earned it."
B0081FD7BA This documentary follows the life of Stan Lee who claims he stumbled into comics and then turned out to love it so much he never wants to retire from the activity. There's a lot of details about his struggling life, working with artists, how famous Marvel characters came to be and especially when he almost walked away for good from comics (when the comic industry took a number of economic and social hits). In the background and foreground is his wife of 40 years who helped him go during the dark times and was always there to amp his mood up and inspire him to keep going.Overall a fun documentary and a must for Stan Lee/Marvel fans.MY GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012 (streamed);"
B0081HVXG4 I wasn't sure if I would like this movie but I did. I wish other seasons were available but they weren't. I would recommend it to others."
B0081HVXG4 I love Jane Austen stories and the period movie series. Loved the actors and slight change in retelling this classic story"
B0081HVXG4 This is a really bad &#34;adaptation&#34; or ruination of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen. It's the worst version out there to date. But the actor playing Edmund is just my type, so I watched it and enjoyed it. The actress playing Fanny is about as far away from the character of Fanny Price as one could get. And she never combs her hair, preferring that &#34;come hither&#34; tousled look, even at her coming out ball. In 1806? Not."
B0081HVXG4 This kept coming up on my \"Recommended\" page because I've been watching a lot of BBC series on Prime lately, so I thought, Oh, why not.This was a joint production between ITV and PBS, designed primarily for the American market.  This explains the heaving decolletage and lip augmentation for the ladies, and the too-long hipster haircuts on the dudes, one of whom looks for all the world like Bob Dylan in his mid-60s Carnaby Street phase.  Theoretically, the movie is based on a novel by Jane Austen.  But even if you're not an \"Austen purist\", it would be hard to class this movie as anything other than a guilty pleasure, though I couldn't tell you where the pleasure is to be derived.  If you want an uncomplicated adaptation of Austen that focuses on the love story to the exclusion of all other concerns, I recommend the Gwyneth version of \"Emma\" -- at least that movie is occasionally humorous.I'm finding it hard to find things to say about this production.  It was over in about and hour and a half.  All background, characterization, and nuance were thrown overboard in order to connect the dots on the map in the most single-minded and simple-minded manner that would arrive at the final destination.  The heroine, as played by Billie Piper, bears not the slightest resemblance to the uptight stick-in-the-mud Fanny Price from the novel.  (Well, okay, perhaps that's an improvement.)  Piper plays Price as a coltish ingenue with her hair perpetually down.  And, from the looks of it, bleached.  Hip.Blake Ritson as Edmund is the only actor among the younger members of the cast who seems to be making any effort to play a recognizably Austenian character.  Generally speaking, the younger members of the cast act too \"modern\", particularly the young woman who plays Mary Crawford.  The older actors are hardly given any screen time, so I can't comment on their efforts.The fact that the entirety of the movie was shot on one location -- some grand old pile or other in Yorkshire -- says volumes about the cheapness of the production.  Neither ITV or PBS really laid down any serious money for multiple sets or additional location shooting.  A lazy production for lazy viewers:  an adaptation of a literary classic done in the forgettable style of a \"Hot Pocket\" microwaveable meal.  2 out of 5."
B0081HVXG4 This PBS version of Mansfield Park is so much superior to the motion picture version of the same, which chose to sensationalize the back story instead."
B0081HVXG4 DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LEAD ACTRESS, WHICH WAS A POOR CHOICE.  SHE TOOK AWAY FROM THE TOTAL FILM,  SHE NEEDS MORE TRAINING IN ACTING.  ALSO, HER HAIR WAS NOT EVEN THE STYLE FOR THE  VICTORIAN,AGE, AND LOOKED SLOPPY..THE MALE LEAD WAS EXCELLENT AND SO WERE THE OTHER ACTORS."
B0081HVXG4 I was hoping this filmed version would bring out some of this novel's virtues, but found myself a trifle bored with it, wishing it would speed up. I liked the characters as played by the actors, and the scenery was fairly fetching, but it seemed slow. It also deviated from the novel quite a bit. Austenites like the novels as is - the plots are almost sacred so messing with the plots isn't smiled upon.The actress who played Fanny played her as a feisty outdoors girl which isn't how I pictured Fanny. If you enjoy seeing stories set in the early 1800's with the fashions and interiors, it's fun to watch from that perspective. It's a visual escape to England of the 1800's which is always a pleasure."
B0081HVXG4 Did not like this movie, there was too much running and did not enjoy the acting as much as the other version."
B0081HVXG4 This was an entertaining rendition of the Austen tale but nothing memorable stands out.  As always in these British productions, beautiful period settings and excellent actors are plentiful, but no performance or take on the plot stands out as extraordinary.  It was still a good way to spend an hour or two, however."
B0081HVXG4 This version of Mansfield Park focused much more on the heroine and her final happy ending with marriage to the younger son. I have seen other versions which brought out some of the other subconflicts between the father and the eldest son who clash over the slavery issue on his father's overseas plantation. The schemes of the unfaithful married cousin to meet with her handsome lover are downplayed in this version as well. This version seems to gloss over the flaws and shortcomings of  many of the characters in the real version of Mansfield Park to make it more acceptable for television audiences. Enjoyable enough to watch."
B0081HVXG4 There are 2 adaptations of Mansfield Park on Amazon Prime.  I watched both of them.  The other I found more to my liking.  This one seemed a bit shallow."
B0082CXI34 Fun show to watch. Definitely worth buying if you watch it alot on Cartoon Network. Own all seasons as of right now!"
B0082CXI34 The adventures of Finn the Human and Jake the dog continue in the Land of Ooo as Finn try to give Marceline the Vampire some help, discover a tribe of humans under the Candy Kingdom, deal with a beardless Ice King, a splinter in Finn's finger and a horse with big eyes that keeps staring at them and more in the second season of \"Adventure Time\"!What is \"Adventure Time\"?Pendleton Ward is known for writing for animated series such as \"Random!

The animation is absolutely fantastic in HD! Colors are vibrant, color palette is colorful and while the character designs may lack incredible detail and shading of other animated series (note: background art is shaded), what makes \"Adventure Time\" work is its abundance of characters, creative backgrounds, locations and more.During my viewing of the series, I did not see any artifacts, banding, even during scenes with a lot of red or orange. Line detail is very strong and for the most part, fans of the series should be happy with t
B0082CXI34 I love adventure time its a good cartoon show best one cartoon has had on in a long time I would recommend it"
B0082CXI34 I love this series!  This season gives us a little more about the world of Ooo and lots more fun."
B0082CXI34 The thing I love most about this show (covering all seasons in fact) is its unique combination of extreme simplicity, gentle playfulness, and profound depth. IfMiffyandMonkeyhad a child, that child would be Adventure Time!There's also an amazing range in the &#34;feel&#34; of the individual episodes. Just in season two alone, that spans the gamut from &#34;The Chamber of Frozen Blades&#34;, a kind of affectionately absurdist homage to the ninja movie craze of the early 80's, to the far deeper but still almost equally playful &#34;Death in Bloom&#34;. In this latter episode our heroes must undertake a classic journey into the underworld. The only difference is, in their case it's to retrieve the soul of a houseplant!In this season we also get to see both the land of Ooo and the psyches of some of its leading characters explored in significantly greater depth. I'm particularly thinking here of the season opener &#34;It Came From The Nightosphere&#34;, as well as &#34;Susan Strong&#34;, and the climactic two-part season finale, &#34;Mortal Folly&#34; and &#34;Mortal Recoil&#34;. The mind of the Ice King in particular may well be unique in all of television: for he is at once a complete sociopath and completely human, with all of humanity's need for love and friendship.Watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry. Still more so when you get to see whole seasons, because it's then that you get to appreciate the full range the creators are capable of. I've heard New Zealand novelist Janet Frame quoted as saying that &#34;a good novel should exercise all the muscles of the heart and mind&#34;.That's what you get in a full season of Adventure Time.Theo."
B0082JW05O Just ok. not the best comedians to chose from, but this was free on prime, so I guess I got my money's worth :)"
B0082JW05O I've been looking for a good standup comedian that knows how to deliver real laughs without making me cringe or change the channel for fear that someone (my grand kids) would see me laugh at crude humor."
B0082JW05O At first, I couldn't understand the low ratings this series got,  but as I watched more of them, I could see a pattern repeating.  Too much reliance on smutty jokes as a whole by each of the comedians, and whether intentional or not, a couple of the comedians seemed to be relying on the same material."
B0082JW05O I made it through about 15 minutes before giving up.  It just wasn't first rate material.  It seems that a lot of stuff on Amazon Prime could be described this way."
B0082JW05O Not so funny. This appears to be the second tier of comedians. If you are looking for something to laugh out loud with, continue looking."
B0082JW05O I enjoy comedy. When there is material I can relate to and presented with confidence and originality, all the better.There are 12 episodes here and they started on the low end of the bell curve and continued with little interest on my part.I would have rated the season one star, maybe two, but three acts raised the tally to a three.The acts that raised the bar for the season were Jesse Popp, David O'Doherty, and Garfunkel & Oates."
B0082JW05O All the actors were excellent.  Pilot grabbed my interest.  Can't really judge if I would keep watching until 2 or 3 more episodes.  Will it get too funky/bizarre?  It is skirting that line and I like that, but if once it gets too too unbelievable and weird would likely drop it.  Jeffrey one of the very best living character actors.  Very cute in lipstick!"
B0082JW05O Good show and a little different. Just long enough to keep your interest but not so long as to get boring."
B0082JW05O I love this show because it showcases new comics.  I usually watch this series just before turning my set off each night."
B0082JW05O This may be related to my sense of humor or my generation, but these people are no Robin Williams, or even Jeff Duham.  Too much commentary on social issues or nu-relatable events instead of relating to common values or situations."
B00831XJ3S ACCOMPLICE stars Richard Arlen as private investigator, Simon Lash. He's on the trail of a missing bank executive. When the man is found dead, Lash sets out to solve the murder. More deaths ensue, as Lash digs deeper into the mystery. ACCOMPLICE is an excellent detective story w/ plenty of twists, culminating in the finale in a castle in the middle of the Arizona desert! Great stuff!..."
B00831XJ3S Enjoyedvthe movie.  Keptbme wondering, trying to figure out who is truthful.  Worth watching.  Audio is sometimes blurred bitbdoea not interfere with watchingm"
B00831XJ3S This was an interesting film, one of those old time B movies you never got to see when... But it was an enjoyable flick. Would recommend ."
B00831XJ3S It was a ok movie, not sure I will watch it again but it was a ok movie.  I like these kinds of movies."
B00831XJ3S Low budget crime entry that is lightweight and clunky, but not without some minimal entertainment value. Very dated and poorly written however."
B0083IJGBU I have watched this throughout my life and I still adore it. I am amazed that, in one summer, a crew could accurately and exquisitely portray a classic story.  In my opinion it is the best adaptation of Jane Austen. Enjoy!"
B0083IJGBU who doesn't want to be lizze and find their darcy? amazing costumes, great dialogue - faitful to the book - great movie."
B0083IJGBU This is the best rendition yet of the Prid and Prejudice book.  Colin Firth is the only sticking point.  He's been lauded for his protrayal of Mr. Darcy, and it was OK.  However, his performance was not as great as all of the other characters, especially the &#34;mother&#34;.  She was hilarious :)  Would recommend highly."
B0083IJGBU So many remakes of P and P and this is my favorite. Was the catalyst to Colin Firths career. Love the scenery and pomp and circumstance."
B0083IJGBU My roommates and I used to take an entire weekend to watch the entire mini-series. Very well done and perhaps my favorite Ms Bennett and Mr Darcy since Garson and Olivier."
B0083IJGBU While many Darcys are merely wooden, you can see the progression of emotions on Firth's face before he speaks. And he still manages to make you like him, even while he is acting like a pompous ass."
B0083IJGBU I have to say, I enjoyed it so much, I just kept watching one episode after another. The actors were excellent!"
B0083IJGBU This film is well acted and therefore, worth the time it takes to watch.  I bought it so that I could watch it whenever I want to re-visit a great classic!!  Beats reading the book..."
B0083IJGBU This captures the Austen wit so perfectly.  The two leads, Ehle and Firth, as well as the entire cast, are just perfect.  I enjoy the later version with Keira Knightly and Matthew McFadyn as well.  It is more sumptuously filmed for the eye candy, but the Ehle and Firth display the ideal interpretations of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy. I particularly find McFadyn's Darcy too stuttery.  Firth is dreamily arrogant yet vulnerable.  Ah...you'll watch it over and over."
B0083IJGBU I recognized the title as a highly praise book, so I was determined to watch it.  The slow start was necessary to set the stage for the following episodes.  The setting was in the 18th century, but the problems woven into the story are very modern. There were so many characters that it took an entire showing for an introduction.  Actually the variety of characters required the watcher to keep up with t
B0083IJGBU I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. To me Colin Firth is Mr Darcy and I could watch it every week."
B0083IJGBU I'm not sure I know anyone who has not seen this movie or some version.  Who doesn't love Mr. Darcy."
B0083IJGBU While this wonderful version of Pride & Prejudice is some years older now, it still, in my opinion, is the best version of Ms. Austen's most beloved classic.  The acting is stellar and the subtleties of Ms. Austen's era has been so carefully reproduced faithfully.  Mrs. Bennett, the mother of her 5 daughters is so irritating and over the top dramatic.  That she is so hard to tolerate, lets us imagine how hard it must have been for Mr. Darcy to even consider marrying into such a family and initially to even view Elizabeth Bennett in a good light. But Mrs. Bennett stands in stark contrast to the main character, Elizabeth Bennett, who is most like Jane Austen herself; self controlled, expressive of her opinions, loyal and looking hard to find what is good in each person she encounters.Austen's novels have passed the test of time because her characters are both noble and fallible, yet they are able to change their opinions when they realize that they are wrong. Such a delightful way to show her audience the many human foibles that exist in everyone. Excellently done!!"
B0083IJGBU This is one of the best period pieces I have seen.  Colin Firth kills it in his porttrayal of Mr Darcy.  It it touching and heart wrenching.  Loved it."
B0083IJGBU I love James Austen's stories and I think this series did a Great Job capturing it. All the actors were perfect for each part they portrayed,especially Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in the lead roles."
B0083IJGBU How many renditions of Pride and Prejudice have been done out there?Far too many...This one is passable..The story has not been adaptedbeyond recognition for which I am thankful. and their saving grace isof course Colin Firth..I liked most everyone else to a point..there wasa great ability for type casting and each character was hit at the topso they had no place to go for development which is just sad as each onecan do more.  Too black and white..this person is the person period.  Nothow Jane intended..All the actors are fine, talented people but theywere put on a short leash..It ends up to be enjoyable if you are not overwhelmedby the stilted commonality of it all."
B0083IJGBU Great series"
B0083IJGBU I just re-watched this series for the umpteenth time. What is it that draws me back time and time again? #1 would have to be Colin Firth's performance. Has any actor ever harnessed the &#34;brooding&#34; factor better than he has as Mr. Darcy? #2 would have to be the sizzling chemistry between Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  Each of their eyes convey so many emotions that it makes my head spin.  I believe Jane Austen would be exceedingly pleased with this adaptation of her work.  I don't understand why they keep making newer versions of the book when it is virtually impossible to match the quality of this series."
B0083IJGBU What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said?  It is absolutely the best rendition of this story ever filmed.  It is my go-to movie if I don't know what else to watch.  And it seems new and fresh every time."
B0083IJGBU This presentation is very very good and the setting and costuming are excellent.  I am only at part 4 but I love every minute.  I have always loved Colin Firth and the younger version of him is even better.I have finished the series and it is my #1 favorite version.  Great presentation!"
B0083IJGBU I have seen four different productions of Jane Austens' story.  They are based on the same book but are portrayed quite differently.They each have their own portrayal of the characters and are all worth watching.  This version is one of my favorites."
B0083IJGBU One of my all time favorite programs.  This one... there are other productions.  Just a wonderful story and  wonderfully acted."
B0083IJGBU I'd never read the book, but I just finished binge-watching three adaptations of 'Pride and Prejudice' on Amazon. Compared to the earlier 1980 BBC version, and the much earlier 1940 Greer Garson film version, I think I liked this 1995 version the best.It's fun to watch the different productions in succession and compare the subtle differences in the story, but I'll leave that for you to enjoy. This version is certainly the funniest, especially in the portrayal of Mrs. Bennet's character!The one unfortunate element that detracts from this version is Elizabeth's horrible, horrible hairstyle. Although her other sisters' hair are quite unremarkable, Elizabeth is for some reason singled out with arguably, the most hideous hair that anyone in that time period could possibly have worn. It never changes through all six episodes, so perhaps it's just an awful wig. But seriously, what were they thinking?!!I enjoyed watching this story; all versions of it, and I hope you like it too!( If you can just ignore Elizabeth's horrible, horrible hairstyle. )"
B0083IJGBU They have made Pride and Prejudice many time and they all seam to have a certain charm, but this is my favorite. The best adaptation and perfect cast."
B0083IJGBU I like this version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" better than any other. It's true to the book, the cast is excellent and the locations are wonderful too. Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy for me."
B0083IJGBU I have read the book and seen every version of it and this is the best!"
B0083IJGBU Better than the movie by far. Not sure why it is called season 1 - is there to be a follow-on?"
B0083IJGBU Collin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are amazing in this version of Pride and Prejudice. This my favorite rendition of Jane Austen's book. I was so excited when they added it to Amazon Prime, now I can watch it even more!! I never get tired of it."
B0083IJGBU Fun to watch and romantic movie series about the book Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad they did this series, it was nice to see it."
B0083IJGBU I really enjoyed Season 1 series! The series is a true reflection of the classic movie! I think that if you really enjoy the classic novels, you will enjoy watching the series of Pride and Prejudice! Money well spent!"
B0083IJGBU Colin Firth could not be dishy-er and Jennifer Ehle more beautiful.  Her interpretation of the erudite and articulate woman within contemporary conventions is  flawless.  Mr. Firth's Mr. Darcy is the wooden, foul-tempered, arrogant soul filled with deep compassion.  Alison Steadman as the  mother is grating and annoying, an interpretation profoundly affected by the vapors.  Father played by Benjamin Whitrow is circumspect and detached with a streak of common sense desperately needed over his perfectly &#34;silly girls.&#34;  I find no fault with this version of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and appreciate a length that allows dramatic play of a complex classic difficult to interpret.  It all ends up with the perfect match in Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  How it gets there is suspenseful, joyous, compelling - every time."
B0083IJGBU It does a very good job telling the story- Austen style.  It did a good job staying true to the original written story."
B0083IJGBU This was a lovely show and I enjoyed it a lot.  I especially liked Lizzy.  I have seen many versions of ths book, on film, on tv, and have read it several times.  I especially liked this one.The mother was a bit much, but father was great to balance her..all through the episodes I kept wondering why he married her.  Wickham was sufficiently slimy, and Collins was just too disgusting..all as was supposed to be.As for Darcy...yummy.  He and Lizzy were a great match."
B0083IJGBU I adore this production of Pride and Prejudice. The beautiful Jennifer Ehle shines in the role of Elizabeth Bennet, and Colin Firth, as the moody and snobbish Darcy is perfect. Amazing supporting cast, lovely settings and a fantastic script makes for the definitive version of this beloved book."
B0083IJGBU Elegantly presented, wonderful character development.  The story is true to the Jane Austin book, and maintains the humor, the thoughtful explorations of love, family and relationships, with marvelous performances by all the players.  I have watched this many times, and still smile, wince, and suffer with Elizabeth.  A favorite for me."
B0083IJGBU This is a classic interpretation of my favorite of Jane Austen's novels: PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  The title describes the attitude of the superior and cold Mr. Darcy (and the aristocrats) who considers himself above the country folk and Bennet family of Elizabeth Bennet.  But early on in this film, you see Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) become attracted to Elizabeth's (Jennifer Ehle) beauty, intelligence, independence and spirit.  She doesn't fawn over him like most.Strong performances by Elizabeth's father, Mr. Bennett (Benjamin Whitrow), Charlotte (Lucy Scott), Collins (David Bamber) stand out to me.  Elizabeth's mother was annoying and her voice grated as it is supposed to according to the plot of the book.  It's wonderful that this novel is serialized in this mini-series so you get all the nuances of the story which a 90-minute movie can't do justice to.It's marvelous seeing the architecture and interiors of Georgian and Regency rooms.  The antiques are wonderful as are the costumes. It seemed this film had a bit of a greenish cast, especially the interior scenes.  Don't know if anyone else noticed that.  It didn't take away from the show, but I did note it. Fans of P&P; should enjoy this more lengthy enactment of Austen's novel.  It's charming."
B0083IJGBU The leads were superb actor,s and made a rather hum drum story interesting, not to mention gorgeous to look at. Colin Firth  makes a woman's heart flutter."
B0083IJGBU All I can say is, it's in the top ten of my &#34;Favorite Pictures&#34;. Out of the ten, it's number 1."
B0083IJGBU I love this book and most adaptations.  This is my favorite as I feel the actors are so suited to their respective roles.  Of course Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are fantastic, but I particularly like Mrs. and Mrs. Bennett's portayals in this series.  I am so happy it is available on Prime so I can watch it as often as I like, which is pretty often!"
B0083IJGBU I chose this rating because it's my favorite movie of all time. I love it because I always imagine myself in their time. I think it's the most romantic movie ever."
B0083IJGBU I give this mini series five stars.  The acting was as wonderful as the story.  It does a great job of capturing the time period.  I love Mr. Darcy!!!"
B0083IJGBU sumptuous costumes & scenery,average otherwise. Very familiar story,most everyone over the age of 12 has been exposed to&#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34;!"
B0083IJGBU I have read the book and other adaptations of this mini-series.  I loved Colin Firth's and Jennifer Ehle's performances, just wish there had been more interaction between the two, nonetheless, I have watched it over and over again over the years."
B0083IJGBU If it has Jane Austen's name on it, we have to see it. She depicts life as it was with such accuracy that it reminds us how fortunate we are not to be living then, even as aristocrats, life was so narrow. However, she laces reality with a generous dose of humor to help us tolerate narrow minds, the lack of choice of a life well chosen even among the wealthy, such strict guidelines of class that are so abominable when viewed from today's stance.She portrays her characters with the genius of insight that makes us love them and hate them, tolerate them and want to lose them in the nearest swamp, but all the time learning what life was for those who did live and love during that time. I only wish she had written even more works for us to learn and ponder...and wonder."
B0083IJGBU Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books which has been adapted so well in this series. Colin Firth is excellent as Darcy, and Julia Sawaltha (also a lead in Lark Rise to Candleford) was exasperating as Lydia. Quite a difference than her Dorcas persona. I don't remember the name of Lizzie, but I did enjoy her performance."
B0083IJGBU You know the saying, \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\".  Well, this is a delightful and entertaining remake of the movie by the same name starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  I really like period pieces, and this remake held a high standard in acting, costumes and scenery. Very well done.  Would highly recommend watching. Five stars are reserved for the original.  By the way, I watched all six/hour long episodes in two days."
B0083IJGBU I really like this version of P&P; the lead actors were very good, and Jennifer Ehle was outstanding, but I think the quality of her work was matched by all the fine character actors in this production, from the quiet, santimonious middle sister Mary, to the nearly almost comatose Mr. Hurst, the envious Kitty, etc., most all the minor characters were believable and added greatly to my enjoyment of the story.  I didn't like the writing of the Mr. Bennett character in the second part of the story: initially he is used to help establish Lizzy and Jane as anchors of stability in the Bennett household, only to begin describing himself (in response to his daughter's elopement), as self-centered and abit lazy, lacking in his fatherly duty, and lacking also in his own moral character.  I found no evidence for his assertions of his own shortcomings when he first started describing himself as such.  In my opinion, for the father to successfully be perceived as lacking in his fatherly duty, I would have needed to see at least one instance of his witnessing Lydia's inappropriate behavior and failing to respond.  As such a sequence was not included, I found it abit jarring for him to be used one way in the film (basically telling the audience who to value - Lizzy/Jane (representing he himself as a quality, father character), and then his character trashed in the second half (basically telling the audience the father is not a quality character) - for this switch to better work, it would have been helpful to give some story evidence.  Therefore, the father character seemed artificial, a contrivance by the writer to attempt to show why Lizzy did not confide in him.  I understand that some explanation for her unwillingness to confide in her father was needed, especially as the writer had established how much they loved one another, but I didn't like the way it was done in the story.  Didn't ruin the film for me because by this time the Lizzy/Darcy relationship was well established, and like most of the audience, their relationship was my main interest, but I did notice the shift in the use of the father's character, and didn't care for it.  Overall, even with my criticisms, the best P&P production I have seen and I really, really enjoyed it."
B0083IJGBU This is the closest &#34;series&#34; I've seen to the book.The role of Fitzwilliam Darcy is definitely betterdone by Colin Firth. He is Darcy."
B0083IJGBU I have watched this version with Colin Firth many times...own the DVD...never tire of the story, the actors and the settings.  I think this is the best version out there.  Glad to see that it is finally on Prime viewing on Amazon...thank you for that!!!"
B0083IJGBU This is a stellar adaptation. Of course, read the book, but there's no harm in these BBC versions! They are VERY good."
B0083IJGBU I enjoyed watching Pride & Prejudice. It was very nicely done. I would highly recommend this program to everyone."
B0083IJGBU This is a staple of my video library, paid some outrageous sum for it on DVD years ago, I've watched it dozens of times, for me the quintessential Pride and Prejudice. I supplement or complement my viewing with other versions, but this one for me is the gold standard, the best of them all.  I'm a Jane Austen admirer and naturally go for versions most in keeping with her books.  Though this one deviates from the book in several ways (the wet shirt scene, for one!), Colin Firth is so phenomenal as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie, and the other characters are so similarly vivid and well-acted (e.g., Jane, Mr. Bingley, everybody), it makes up for it.The one I find truest to the book, and with a more spirited (er, oppositional, impertinent, self-possessed) Lizzie and a more restrained Darcy, is the 1980Pride and Prejudice (BBC Miniseries)(free to stream for Prime members right now).  Despite the less posh production values, there were several things I preferred in this version, the mother's character for one (though I like Allison Steadman, I don't care for the depiction of Mrs. Bennet in the Firth-Ehle version, SO annoying).  And, the 1980 offering included a number of scenes from the book not found in the Firth-Ehle version, to round out one's P&P; experience.  This version develops the characters more fully (except for Jane), for example, Lydia, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (below).***MANY SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Austen was brilliant and there's a LOT going on in her books, so, not easy to capture it all in any one film reproduction.  Just one example, is the complexity of Mr. Bennet.  Although he loves Lizzie, he's quite a jerk, insults his wife and other daughters constantly, isn't happy with his lot in life and fancies himself superior to others (perhaps with little justification).  He married Mrs. Bennet, a flirt and the belle of the ball, because he was sexually attracted to her, but rapidly lost interest.  The extent to which that dynamic is revealed was better captured in the 1980 version, I thought.  In the Firth-Ehle version, Mrs. Bennett is presented as an overwrought  drama-queen, frequently overcome by \"my poor nerves\".  Mr. Bennet's frequent retreat to his library, and even his sarcastic remarks (often at her expense) are seen as simple reactions to that, understandable.In fact, Austen makes it clear that Mr. Bennet's pettiness, lack of love for and support of his wife, his dismissive attitude towards her, his air of superiority and ENDLESS messing with, er, \"trifling\" with her head, are not justified by and are far more egregious faults in Lizzie's eyes than those displayed by her mother.  These issues are all tied up in the twin notions of being of good character and marrying out of love and/or regard for the other in the first place, instead of merely what you can GET from them.  Indeed, a central theme of the book is Lizzie and Darcy improving each other, that's what good relationships do.  (I think the marriage of Charlotte and Mr. Collins fits that bill too, re: basic regard/respect for each other and them improving one another, ultimately a happy union.)  Another Austen theme is honesty, self-examination, which Darcy evinces in abundance, but Mr. Bennet only rarely.  Another point of contrast between them is the care and solicitude Darcy evinces towards his errant sister, taking his share of the responsibility, unlike Mr. Bennet.  Indeed, the couple of times Mr. Bennet IS honest and admitting of error, it's such a big deal Austen underlines it, in effect (to be seen in both versions).Though Lizzie loves her father dearly, she doesn't hold him in especially high regard, and in a very effective scene in this version, the line: \"He [Darcy] is the best of men.  He is truly the BEST man I have ever known...\" is added, not in the original text, nor were Mr. Bennet's tears, but it's bittersweet because her father is hurt, yet happy for his Lizzy.  And it's doubly poignant because, not only has she found a man with all the qualities her father lacks, but miracle of miracles, she LOVES him and he her!  And SUCH a surprise, because he initially seemed such a cad.  This is just one thread of MANY in the tale, and it is intriguing to me how different versions embody both the actual content of Austen's books and her implications, her incisive and canny characterizations.  I watch different film versions to partake of the different details provided by each, for me they complement each other nicely.  The entire scene from the book in which Lizzie tells her father she loves Darcy is omitted from the 1980 film, oddly, but for me made up for by its ending, closely paralleling the book, in which Elizabeth and Darcy quietly discuss how they fell in love.  Both adaptations have their strengths.Another film (mini-series) that for me virtually channels Jane Austen [her marvelous language, her wry wit] isLost in Austen, in which a modern day reader accidentally gets transported into the story, swapping lives with Lizzie- intriguing, marvelous (though events transpire VERY differently).  If you like time travel movies and Jane Austen, don't miss it.This Pride and Prejudice was my favorite BBC-type production for many years, and I still love it, butNorth & Southhas replaced it as my absolute favorite.  It's about a woman who moves from the bucolic South of England to Yorkshire, might as well be the moon (where men and women actually shake hands, and say what they mean, unbelievable).  She soon meets cryptic, driven, smoldering Richard Armitage, and the sparks fly.  Romantically, it has many of the same themes as Pride and Prejudice, but told in a different way- it's no comedy of manners, no dances and flirting and game-playing, instead, full of existential and life or death issues and class struggles (against the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution, which exploded in the north, transforming society), it's ALIVE with longing and romantic promise, as well as the heady sense of a brand new age.  PHENOMENAL.  I watched it on instant video and immediately bought the DVD.Anyway, if you haven't seen this, watch it, I think you'll love it as I do, and if you get the Jane Austen bug, you might then trySense And Sensibility,EmmaandPersuasion, all favorites, though Persuasion was Austen's last book and most mature work, rather quiet and introspective, slow-moving.  Viva Jane Austen!"
B0083IJGBU Some people go to there childhood food that gave them comfort .  I however, go to the films that gives me comfort ,&#34; Pride & Prejudice&#34; with Colin Firth is the most comforting 6 hours I can spend. With Jane Austin novel brought to life, this version is more than any other, to be the best."
B0083IJGBU With the exception of the movie version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, I own all three adaptations of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - the 1980 version, Pride and Prejudice (BBC Miniseries), the 1995 BBC series, Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition), and the 2005 film version starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen, Pride & Prejudice. Of these, my favorite is the 1995 BBC adaptation which I've watched countless times.There's something infinitely charming about the 1995 adaptation. The casting is wonderful, especially in the casting of Colin Firth as the delectable Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. I do not think any other actor has come close to portraying the role of Mr. Darcy with such perfection and aplomb, though David Rintoul and Matthew McFadyen have both done credible turns in their roles in the 1980 and 2005 versions respectively. As for the role of dear Elizabeth Bennet, Jennifer Ehle may at first appear to be a bit too old to play the role of Ms. Eliza Bennet, but her depiction of the role is one of the best I've seen as she truly embodies Elizabeth's fiercely independent spirit and strong will (Elizabeth Garvie is my next favorite from the 1980 version, and Keira Knightley is the most age-appropriate to have played the role).The chemistry between Ehle and Firth is strong, and their verbal sparring is a joy to watch! The other roles are equally well-cast - there's Alison Steadman as the silly but incredibly shrewd Mrs. Bennet; Benjamin Whitrow as her long-suffering husband; Julia Sawalha as the flirty and reckless Lydia (the best portrayal of Lydia in my humble opinion, and Sawalha went on to star in another of my favorite BBC series, Lark Rise to Candleford); Adrian Lukis as the unscrupulous Wickham; David Bamber as the oily Mr. Collins, and Barbara Leigh Hunt as the domineering dowager Lady Catherine de Burgh. This ensemble cast comes together to deliver memorable performances that have and continue to delight audiences.Oh, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous! Elizabeth Bennet was not the only one to be awestruck when she has her first sighting of Pemberley. It is so beautiful and stately, and appropriately awe-inspiring. The score is beautiful and one which I don't mind listening to each time a new episode begins.I have come to think of the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice as a classic, and it truly deserves this status. I know I will be watching it for many more years to come!"
B0083ZLR24 All I will say is, awesome! I am so hooked to this show and own all seasons. Enjoy watching all of them again and again!"
B0083ZLR24 this is hands down the coolest cartoon i have ever seen in all my 31 yrs. I even keep up with it every week. chracters and concept rock my socks. if there were ever a post apocalyptic world id hope it was like ooo."
B0083ZLR24 Best cartoon series cartoon network has had on in a long time I recommend it to anyone who likes cartoons its cool I love it"
B0083ZLR24 Adventure Time!  As usual, great work.  Wacky and entertaining so fun for many ages.  Some darker themes and jokes are included."
B0083ZLR24 This is the third season of Adventure Time I've reviewed. It's also the first time I've been moved to review so many seasons of a single show. As I said in my review of season two, \"Watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry.\" As I also said in that same review \"The thing I love most about this show (covering all seasons in fact) is its unique combination of extreme simplicity, gentle playfulness, and profound depth.\"Well, all that still holds true.  But do I have anything fresh to say? Anything more to add that justifies writing this third review?As an audience, we're no longer automatically blown away by the sheer range and depth the creators of this series are so obviously capable of. We've just come to expect it. So we're not going to be stunned by this offering in quite the same way that we might have been by earlier seasons. But we are in no way left wanting: the quality has not dropped one jot. And although on one level this series is more of the same, the show most definitely continues to develop. It's never reduced to mere repetition or self referencing.In keeping with the underlying trend of past seasons, the complexity of the characters continues to evolve. Perhaps the most marked and obvious examples of this are in two of my all time favorite episodes, \"Holly Jolly Secrets, parts 1 and 2\". But I'm not going to say any more than that. If you've seen those episodes, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And if you haven't,  I don't want to deprive you of the experience of going on that journey for yourself.This trend towards ever increasing character complexity is also apparent in such coming-of-age episodes as \"Too Young\" and \"Incendium\", although never in an obvious or heavy handed way. As always in this series, there's a wonderful lightness of touch. The deeper layers of meaning are readily apparent, but we're not hit over the head with them in the way we might be in more standard Hollywood fare. They're just there for those who feel ready and inclined to think about them. Indeed, perhaps this show's greatest virtue is that its creators know when to leave things unsaid.Yes, they actually have enough respect for the intelligence of their audience to do that.Incredible, huh?Which also brings me to the single episode that perhaps best embodies my earlier statement that watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry: \"Thank You\". For those who know the episodes but not by name, this is the one that focuses on the Snow Golem. It's also episode number 17 in this season.Finally, it's worth adding that this is the season that sees the first appearance of \"Fiona and Cake\", the gender swapped version of Adventure Time! Honestly, I think this season is worth buying just for that alone. I especially love the way the existence of stories about these alternative versions of the characters is justified within the show's own universe. Which could get me back to \"Holly Jolly Secrets\", but... No.Like I said before: some things I want you to experience for yourself.Theo."
B008494L22 This looks like one of the early &#34;Masterpiece Mystery&#34; series. The stories and acting are good but there is a sort of &#34;stagey&#34; effect in the indoor filming which seems to be typical of the late 60's and early 70&#34;s.I must confess to never having read any of the Father Brown books so I can't say if they follow Chesterton's writing or stray a bit like so many other book to film mysteries tend to do. The plots are intriguing and Father Brown, like Miss Marple, has a remarkable insight into human nature......."
B008494L22 I love it and always loved the father Brown mysteries and it's a great made for TV version of it !"
B008494L22 Father Brown exhibited self-restraint when confronted with ill-mannered or arrogant persons.  His quiet, calm demeanor was pleasant to watch.  Would have enjoyed seeing more of his detective friend."
B008494L22 For the most part I enjoyed this. By today's standards (it was produced in the 1970s) it would be considered naive. The show seemed more like an good amature theater production than a TV show. The acting was sometimes forced, some of the plots were trite, and almost every episode seemed produced and performed. That doesn't mean it was bad. Considering it was essentially live TV it was very good. Kenneth Moore was very believable as a who-dunnit priest, most of the stories were well written and provided decent entertainment for a mystery enthusiast."
B008494L22 As usual, British show tend to be subtle. Father Brown Mysteries is even more so. It's on my watch list. I found the mysteries challenging."
B008494L22 I remember seeing these Father Brown episodes on PBS when I was a kid.I think Kenneth Moore is well cast in the role of Father Brown, and I thinkthe plots were true to Chesterton's original short stories."
B0084RZPPQ this movie was boring and felt so fake and staged to me.  Did not enjoy it but kept waiting to see if it got better"
B0084RZPPQ Low budget film that is plagued by unoriginal scenarios, terrible effects, awful dialogue, and horrible acting...and not in a good way"
B0084RZPPQ God please tell these film school pimps to quit making these awful clones.  It seems there is no end in sight of the film school rejects efforts at selling a product whose time has come and gone years and years ago!  Don't make any more!"
B0084RZPPQ I was happy when I found a bunch of new additions to streaming. Until I started to watch 'em. Geez... man, how easy is it to get your flick out there these days??? Movie making used to be a complex undertaking. You have lots of different elements that need to be executed, coordinated, put together, and then finally distributed. Not for the faint of heart! But it must not be that way anymore, judging from the latest batch of secretions up for our viewing pleasure! I will admit I did not put myself through to the end, not even the middle. I immediately noticed that the camera work was subpar, well below even soap opera standards. The acting, if you can call it that, well.... sorry, no. Once we got to the screaming, 'possessed' kid, I bailed. No friggin' way! Seriously man. Just no!"
B0084RZPPQ This movie was second rated type movie act was not up to par could have been made better, it was ok I forced my self to watch it till the end."
B0084RZPPQ The film makers really should stop watching reality TV and actually go to film school to learn how to make movies."
B0084RZPPQ I like this sort of movie, so for me all that was missing was some popcorn.  I thought some of the actors were very good.  The movie changes venues a few times, so that kept it from getting boring, (we get to spend the evening at a bar in a long intermission from ghost hunting during the middle) and it lacked the annoying screaming that ruins so many movies and tv shows for me.  The ending was a bit surprising, althou
B0084YC47G I fell asleep twice while trying to watch this.  Honestly, this could have been done in one episode.  I can't think of a single highlight worth mentioning.  But I was curious about what Carole had done to her lips.  But if you are into whining...you will enjoy both episodes.  If you are into fakeness...you will enjoy Aviva in the reunion episodes.  I did however finally realize who Heather reminded me of...it has bothered me all season.  Her face is the spitting image of Lady Elaine Fairchilde from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.  And that is pretty much it."
B0084YC47G i miss kelly and jill a bit and wasnt sure if i liked the new folks. (other than carole who i loved on sight and love more with each episode \"im definitly coming on the trip now!\")aviva turns out to be wacky but wonderful and her dad is the best new character ever. we ALL have embarrassing and inconvenient relatives who are beloved and mortifying at the same time. He deserves his own show. He is unfiltered and outlandish and the best part is her reaction to him. I cannot wait to see him interact with luann (who seems more comfortable this season) and ramona (who i actually like this season and who loves to revert to her religion when all else fails)Aviva and family (including her mother in law- herself a character) could easily have their own show. all in all very cool. oh- and of course sonja is her fantastic self. still love her."
B0084YC47G These woman are the reason I CHOOSE to have no female friends! All the bickering and arguing is entertaining to watch though. This city and jersey are the BEST real housewives! Thank you Bravo!"
B0084YC47G Bravo really needs to do better than this.  The three duds you brought on to replace Jill and Alex are just not working.  Please bring back Jill and Alex.  I never thought I would say this, but I am liking Ramona more and more and actually find her to be more trustworthy than anyone else on the show.  I do like LuAnn, but she is becoming too competitive, and I wish she would stop.  I find her, however, to be much more likable than the princess you brought on the show.  I think that Carole Radziwill is an accomplished person, but on this kind of program, she just does not work out well.  She is kind of boring.  I won't be watching next season, and I just got into the Real Housewives of New York, and found it interesting until this year.  Some of the Real Housewives shows are getting old, and this is one of them."
B0084YC47G Aviva Drescher's father George Teichner is a truly disgusting creature. A perfect example of his race. Any decent producer would have neglected to subject us to the filth of George Teichner but in this case, the producers are of his same people, and so don't have such decency."
B0084YC47G Once you have watched the four seasons, this fifth season is a good follow up.  New characters and crazy situations make it a fun watch."
B0085SOJ1A Very cool show! Every episode is really engaging and it's really interesting to see these men and a few women risk their lives doing this kind of work, which is immensely hard. I just can't believe the whole process,it's worth seeing!"
B0085SOJ1A Missed the Grade and slid off the road. The writers must have been snowed in because is no longer worth watching."
B0085SOJ1A Continues where the last season ended and is just and intense and competitive as last season, if not more so.  Give it a try."
B0085SOJ1A Have watched this series from the beginning.  Enjoyed the series more when it moved to Alaska highway, good characters, etc.and watching them maneuver the Dalton is fascinating.  Switching back and forth from Canada to Alaska to get previous characters kicked out of Canada is a bore.  Showing more of the antagonism than the courtesy which was highlighted in the beginning shows now."
B0085SOJ1A This season (6) showcases not only the differences in the different types of ice roads but also how teamwork (or the lack of teamwork) can really make or break down a trip. The cold is intense, not only outside, but between some of the drivers. While not as exciti
B0085SOJ1A I like that this season they mixed up things a bit. Putting drivers on different parts of the tundra running on different roads.Being a truck driver myself, I always respect these guys running in severe cold and snow."
B0085SOJ1A This is a good series.  I admire these drivers that risk their life and work under harsh conditions to bring food to the table of their family."
B0085SOJ1A Still a good show and the cast is great, but its missing Lisa. Where did she go? Bring her back and keep it goin."
B0085SOJ1A This season of I.R.T. is just a rehash of what had gone on before.  The two jerks, Hugh &#34;The Polar Bear&#34; and Rick &#34;The Cross between a Woman and a Parrot&#34; showed how they burned themselves out on the long haul route to Prudhoe Bay and got stuck driving the less profitable routes to Northern Canada.  At the end Hugh did it again by blowing off another employer.  I can't believe how these two can tear up an 18 wheeler unless it's part of this scripted series. Overall my rating has dropped from 4 Stars to only Three now."
B0085SOJ1A The show struggles to bring &#34;drama&#34; and picks a few random truckers to do this with.  It's apparent why the show is not doing well and while is very informative, a lot of the survival and advice for the truckers is valuable but mainly common sense.  It leaves the show with a relatively irritating feeling after having watched it.  If you want &#34;excitement&#34; with the right amount of &#34;male&#34; drama...check out Gold Rush, Seasons 1, 2, & 3."
B0085SOJ1A Well, first off this program is actually creative in many ways, but several of reasons is be cause this show is about real people living real lives, and isn't about (A) cops, (B) doctors, (C) lawyers, (D) MURDER.....The Hugh & Rick team seem to have mellowed a bit, and I think that Alex is (and continues to be) a great guy. Pork chop was an interesting infusion this season, and it seemed that he was cut loose just about the same time he was starting to catch on. Good luck to you Pork chop. The duel between Jack J. and Darrel was interesting, but it seems a bit overplayed. It was interesting to watch Justin grow a bit wiser as the season progressed, and swap out &#34;get there i-tus&#34; for safe, sane, and successful.One thing that this season was missing (is missing) is Lisa. Still interesting and I like that the focus was a bit more on the drivers than it was just certain parts of the &#34;haul road&#34;."
B0085SOJ1A As a trucker, I can readily understand some of the absolutely riveting scenarios presented here. I am a long time watcher and I will continue as long as the shows are available."
B0085SOJ1A Ice Road Truckers: Season 6Other than AX MEN, IRT is the only other REALITY TV-DOCUMENTARY THAT I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR (EXCEPT FOR SWAMP LOGGERS, MAYBE-they search for sunken cypress logs from logging operations 100+ years ago and are very sought after by the furniture making people-they feel around with their feet with alligators and poisonous snakes all around).  This is year 6 of IRT and the only way you can get it is to put the program where the angels live (your video library).  So, what eventually happens is Amazon going broke and you loose everything entrusted to them.  As of now, the BLU-RAY/DVD is not available which is a sweet deal for Amazon cause all they are doing is moving bits and bytes around in their large capacity computer.I watch IRT cause I still want to see a semi-trailer go through the ice.  Last year they conducted a DOT experiment by actually having a live person in a truck go under but it wasn't a fair experiment as the guy had frosty the snowman cold weather clothes on and lots of people standing around with grappling hooks to pull him out.  They say you got 10 minutes and it could be hours before another trucker comes by.  That's why they have wolves and bears up there so there isn't a big mess to clean up in Spring!  Last year they had Lisa, first woman driver.  This year they have a 23 year old young man who looks like he's still in high school and a ##%^%$&* know it all driver from \"down south\", plus the usual assortment of steady hands.  One of the drivers who works with Hugh, Alex, had all kinds of sickness so they called in the \"professional MIB\" who found dead mice the size of chipmonks and they totally cleaned the inside of his truck out but they think he has the \"Hunta Virus??\" - the same disease affecting about 25000 people who visited Yellowstone Park this year - touch and go on him.Guys should enjoy this program and ladies may soil themselves!"
B0085SOJ1A Much of the same. Somewhat interesting but the producers can only go so far in creating any interest after the 5 seasons before this one."
B008620ZTA The 3rd season of Rookie Blue was a great season. Each subsequent season is better than the last really love this series."
B008620ZTA Rookie Blue is WELL-WORTH the cost. Season 3 has taken on a whole new/AWESOME level. Kudos to the writers and actors. This episode will captivate you. The emotional journey is one that is so gracefully put together that even as an avid fan it drew me in more than ever."
B008620ZTA Hooray for a show with more than one female story line. It is great to see women playing dynamic characters."
B008620ZTA This was by far entertaining.I loved that you kept up with all the main character's love lifes and what they had to deal with outside of the police station. Wonder what will happen in the next season!"
B008620ZTA It's as realistic as I've seen. I was in Law Enforcement over 30 yrs, 26 yrs as dispatcher. It's an adrenaline rush one minute & quiet for a little while."
B008620ZTA This episode is too depressing. 1 officer being assualted, ok possible. 2 officers goes directly to depressing. Sorry, un-beliveable and it takes drama and turns it into just a depressing episode. They should have written this better. This ruins drama by being too un-realistic."
B008620ZTA This show has turned out to be one of my favorites. Very realistic to life. EMOTIONALLY CHARGED. CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT SEASON."
B008620ZTA WAITING FOR THE NEXT SEASON. I NOW HAVE A WAY TO VIEW IT WITH MY KINDLE FIRE. WHEN IS THE NEXT SEASON ?"
B008620ZTA Season 3 can seem confusing if this is the first season you're watching. The back stories on the characters are well developed and make watching the season 1 & 2 well worth the time. The actors seem to have developed their character's drives and complexities and thus seem real in season 3. I like that each of the main characters is given a chance to show who they are and why they do and react to the same situations that fit their character's personality. There is still the group doing police proceedures as seen from each characters perspective. Some have said it's like the show Grey's Anatomy but I see it more like the Law and Order shows. I enjoy seeing how the characters actions drive the stories each week. The writers have been able to keep season 3 fresh and hopefully this will continue. I appreciate the lack of soap opera cliffhangers that other shows use to keep the viewer \"hooked\". The acting and writing is solid and it's a good show."
B008620ZTA I really am liking the way the characters develop.  It's a series I can't stop watching, and I hope they keep going a long time."
B0086213XW I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done.  The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go.  Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life?  The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout.  I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness.  Worst of all, I did not respect her.  Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf.  Who was she?  Where was her determination and sense of purpose?  And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?"
B0086213XW Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff? These seemed like two nice normal people. The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.For the first hour of this movie, there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism. By the end, just a nasty taste in the mouth."
B0086213XW I'm not sure how this got such a bad rap, but for some reason people have fun hating this movie.  With an average rating that plateaus in the middle, and 43 `1 Star' reviews, you'd think that this was a pretty awful movie and yet I found it to be one of the best films of 2012.Seriously.What I love so much about `Take this Waltz' is the ability it has to be wholly honest about so much without ever beating us over the head with it.  It presents us with a conundrum of sorts, delving into a relationship that feels very authentic and very natural.  Margot and Lou live in a cute little house in a cute little community and they have a cute (at times bizarre and yet that is really the most authentic part) relationship.  The film opens with Margot meeting Daniel on a plane and winds up having chemistry she wants to ignore because she married only to have that chemistry take over when she realizes Daniel lives right across the street from her.  While she loves her husband, it's the little things that corrode every marriage and soon she finds herself entertaining the idea of an affair.I find it rather ridiculous that people take issue with the representation of Margot here, claiming that just because she's a woman she's portrayed as a victim and if she had been a man she'd be seen as a villain.  It's kind of like the people who griped about `Brokeback Mountain' being easier on the main characters because they were gay.  NO, that isn't what is going on here.  `Take this Waltz', and `Brokeback Mountain' as well, look at the situation from a particular angle.  Instead of focusing on the betrayed spouse, these films look at the difficulties that arise in the minds of the one doing the betraying.  Here we see the constant back and forth that comes when Margot tries to talk herself in and then out of her affair.  This is natural and real, raw.  It is believable.The film doesn't stop there though, because it really gives us a look at the chaos that is caused in the lives of all those affected by Margot's actions, including her own, which is really why I take issue with claims that she's portrayed as a victim.  She suffers the consequences of her own actions and we, the audience, are allowed to pity her because of that.We can thank Michelle Williams for that.  As Margot, Williams finds a beautiful way of exposing the guilt her character feels as she flirts with an affair she continues to tell herself she will not venture into.  What I love so much about what Michelle does here is that she never once plays up the victim card despite allowing us to see her tortured emotional stance.  You feel for her, but not in the way you might expect.  She doesn't vie for our sympathies, she merely exposes both sides of the affair through the eyes of a woman torn.  Her love for her husband is never doubted and yet she continually doubts herself and that leads her to doubt her marriage and her husband's affections and her eventual catastrophic decisions.  The film is beautifully composed and reflects on the affair from a purely unbiased eye, which is refreshing.  To all the naysayers saying that this affair is portrayed as a woman's self-discovery as opposed to the devastating act that it really is surely missed the point of the film.  There was no discovery other than the obvious; that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.Those bookends just kill me!"
B0086213XW I took a chance and watched this film late one night mostly because I am a fan of Sarah Polley both as a director and actress but I felt the writing was juvenile, the story simplistic, and the directing mediocre. She had all the right ingredients to make a wonderful film but nothing really meshed. The story was fairly simple.  Michelle Williams played a young woman who meets Luke Kirby on a trip to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia.  They end up in the same plane home to Toronto and then find out they live across the street from one another.  Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful love story but oops, sorry, Michelle's character Margot is already married to Lou, played by Seth Rogan, and expresses that she is still in love with him. Unfortunetly she is very intrigued by Daniel, (Luke Kirby), and thus begins the basis for the entire film; whether she should stay with Lou, who is nice and sweet and safe or try something different and start a relationship with Daniel.  The worst part, for me, was the lack of chemistry between Michelle Williams and her husband as well as her potential lover. I found Luke Kirby very sexy and I just kept wondering what does he see in this childish, neurotic, simplistic young woman other than her looks. She was so needy in a very agitated way that it made me very uncomfortable. I thought Seth Rogan did a suprisingly good job in a role outside his usual comedic genre and Luke Kirby could have been much better if he had been given a better muse and better, more unique dialogue. SPOILER! I found the scene in the cafe where he tells Margot what he would physically like to do to her almost embarassing because it was like he was professing his love and lust to child and not a sexy woman. It is frustrating when a film that has so much potential leaves you so disappointed. I want to give it lower ratings but I gave it 3 stars because I could see there was alot of effort by Polley and the cast but, in the end, it just didn't work for me."
B0086213XW Despite some terrific acting performances (with Seth Rogen shining by dialing down his goofiness to a level that actually works) this whole thing is let down by a very weird script. At times the dialogue rings true and at other times it's just plain off kilter. The whole movie is off kilter. Trying to make Toronto seems sexy seems well so...pretentiously like the wannabe New Yorkers are that make up Toronto (sorry, director Sarah Polley, but you only reconfirmed what the rest of Canada thinks of people from Tarrana).I'll admit, as in the Making Of extra adds, that the lighting was very unique and a lot of what Polley does is good but I don't think she's yet capable of making a truly good movie until she gets a bit older and gains some life experience. The characters written seem stunted adults whose attempts at justifying their actions seem childish and childlike.Also, what was up with making the artist a rickshaw driver? Really, that's his part-time job? There're still rickshaw drivers in 2012 in the Centre of The Universe?Then explain to me what was up with the amount of showers Michelle Williams seemed to take. We even get a women's water aerobics class shower scene-a-go-go that runs like some Porky's meets health science scene.The biggest head scratcher is when (SPOILER ALERT) Williams leaves Rogen for the artist, we get a montage that features a FFM and a MMF threesome. So we're supposed to believe that throughout the lengthy chaste \"courtship\" that actually Williams was secretly a freaky sexplorer?The entire movie does not compute despite it trying to have a say on modern relationships."
B0086213XW Boring life, boring wife with boring husband,then grahic sex with new man. Then back to boring.Then it ends with her going back to whatever she was dreaming about."
B0086213XW Enter Margot (Michelle Williams); saying Margot has a lot of quirks is an understatement. Margot is downright flawed. She's very peculiar with not only the things she likes, but in everything she does. She's afraid of the thought of being afraid; those in-between moments in life. The events that kick off those moments and their conclusions don't phase her one way or the other, but what bridges together those moments is the most terrifying thing in the world to Margot. While traveling, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby); a private painter who makes his living pulling a rickshaw around town. There's chemistry between Margot and Daniel right from the start, but Margot is married to a chef named Lou (Seth Rogen) so things are obviously a little complicated. There's this simultaneous unstoppable chain of events that transpires as Margot gets closer and closer to Daniel, but she feels her marriage to Lou crumbling in the process. It's an in-between moment that Margot has lost all control over.This is the most frustrating movie of the year; hands down. It's nearly two hours of characters being pulled in directions they don't want to go and playing tug of war with their emotions when things could easily be resolved with a few simple actions. For a movie whose screenplay was included in The Black List a few years ago, the final result is a huge letdown. The dialogue is downright atrocious at times. Margot's little \"gaylord\" speech to Daniel being the prime example, but their exchange on the airplane leaves you with a furrow in your brow. Margot says something along the lines of, \"I'm afraid of being afraid,\" after confessing her fears to Daniel to which Daniel replies, \"That sounds like the most dangerous thing in the world.\" Really? Because like seven hundred other things come to mind that are way more dangerous.The three main characters leave you with the urge to lobotomize yourself. Margot can't make a decision to save her life and when she finally does she regrets not staying on the path she was already on. Lou is seriously a contender of the most childish excuse of an adult to grace the silver screen. The immature jokes between him and Margot make you want to projectile vomit on newborn puppies and the two of them have the worst pillow talk you could possibly imagine. Daniel is the most interesting of the three, but only because he acts so cryptic and tries so hard to be this enigma. You remember that scene in \"Family Guy\" where Stewie mocks people who think they're photography majors because they took a black and white picture of a lawn chair? That's kind of the way Daniel is with painting.The entire movie can be summed up in four actions; cooking, sleeping, being immature, and cheating on your husband. The end. Cue \"Video Killed the Radio Star.\" Thirty minutes in and you're ready for every character to s**t or get off the pot. \"Take This Waltz\" also includes a shower scene with about a dozen women you wish you never saw naked. After seeing it, you'll be convinced that the only reason Sarah Silverman joined the cast was to get naked on screen and brag about how hot she looks.\"Take This Waltz\" tries to take advantage of this preconceived notion that you already love this movie even though you haven't seen it yet. It tries so hard to be cute and cuddly and emotional and it winds up being massively annoying in the process. \"Here's some actors you may have enjoyed in other things along with some humor you won't find funny and a horrid screenplay that we insist on cramming down your throat. Oh and people cry a lot, so you better do that too.\"It will be a damn miracle if you can finish \"Take This Waltz,\" but if you do you'll have to fight every urge to run off into the night, scream at the top of your lungs, and tell every couple within a six block radius to just end it now and screw the first person they come into contact with because that'll be quicker and easier than pretending to love each other and wasting everyone's time for an undetermined amount of years. Just save yourself the trouble and punch a brick wall; it'll have a better outcome."
B0086213XW Take This Waltz is a slow moving quirky movie. There was something unique about this film, something that caught my attention from the first moment.The film opens with a beautiful song, light quirky words, slightly on the folk side. The opening montage is a set of close ups of Margot making cup cakes. One of the last shots is of her sitting in front of the oven, a man in shorts walks past and the montage ends with an out of focus shot of the man standing in front of a bright window. I describe this very carefully because the film closes with exactly this same series of shots. They are identical, except for one small detail; the man is wearing long pants.The film then moves to a town on the east coast of Canada where Margot writes the new brochure copy for a Colonial town. A man taunts her to participate in a mock flogging. He ends up sitting next to her on the plane home. Turns out he lives across the street and they share a cab home, as they part ways she says under her breath, \"I'm married.\" Margot is married to Lou, a chef writing a chicken cookbook.This next paragraph has spoilers in it. If you would rather not know some details, skip this paragraph.Ultimately, Margot ends up having an affair with Daniel. The literal interpretation of this affair is that she is a horrible person, doing what so many people do. She should be in love with her funny schlub of a husband. Her life is fabulous and she should be happy. Instead she falls for this handsome sexy guy across the street. I contend that there is another way to look at this film. Lou wore shorts a lot in this film. Daniel never wore shorts once, in fact the director made sure we got to see his Capri pants, they were always long pants; even at the beach. Margot never cooks in the whole film; in fact she hates the kitchen. The opening and closing montage style is completely different from the rest of the film. It is an intimate dance with Margot, the close ups of her bare feet moving gracefully. Throughout the film she wears funky sneakers, rarely barefoot. The opening and closing montage say that the affair was a fantasy. If I look back on the film with the idea that the affair was completely in Margot's head, the film takes on a completely different amazing turn. It all makes sense and is powerful.The film is beautifully made. The interiors are full of stuff, bright colored stuff. Margot wears some of the funkiest unusual clothes. The exteriors portray a Toronto neighborhood so perfectly, open and green. The trips into the city are tight shots with all kinds of activity everywhere. Michelle Williams is absolutely radiant. She is bohemian, wears those unusual clothes perfectly. She as well as Sarah Silverman are never afraid to take off her clothes. They are both beautiful women comfortable with their bodies. Seth Rogan and Luke Kirby are also confident, but both stand to the side to let the women shine. This is a strong cast. I do have one complaint about the Montreal airport, it is not Dorval - the chairs, halls, and doors are all wrong. Given the attention to detail in this film, I'm surprised that slipped in.The film is almost two hours long. It does move along at about the same slow pace throughout. Frankly, I liked this pace. This isn't an action picture; it is a sort of romance or a slow slide into a fantasy world. I would guess it was too slow for a lot of viewers. This is an R rated film. There are several scenes with full frontal and rear female nudity. There is a scene in the middle of the film where Daniel describes what he wants to do to Margot. It is one of the most sensual scenes I have ever watched where nobody ever took off their clothes or even touched. There is an artistic scene of two people having sex, reasonably well covered. There is some strong language. The film is intended for mature audiences.This film was less about betrayal and more about what boredom and fantasy will lead people to think. I loved the quirkiness of this film. The soundtrack was perfection. Sarah Silverman and Michelle Williams were amazing. Although slow moving, I was moved by this film."
B0086213XW Sarah Polley proves her impressive directorial and screenwriting debut, 2006'sAway From Herstarring a luminous, Oscar-nominated Julie Christie as an Alzheimer's patient, was no fluke with this incisive look at a most inchoate love triangle. With a title taken from Leonard Cohen's cultish song, this clear-eyed yet melancholic 2012 drama once again showcases Polley's prodigious acumen in capturing the complexity of adult relationships without casting blame or judgment on the parties involved. The focal point of the triangle is 28-year-old Margot, an aspiring writer from Toronto on an assignment in Nova Scotia to write the copy for a travel brochure on historic Louisbourg. There she meets Daniel, also from Toronto where he is a struggling artist and a rickshaw driver. An attraction is almost immediate but not consummated. When they fly home on the same plane, Margot discovers he lives just across the street from her, which complicates matters since she's been married for five years to Lou, a cookbook author specializing in chicken dishes. Their marriage is comfortable, and their interactions reflect a lived-in familiarity marked by cute practical jokes and quirky riffs of humor.But what Margot sees in Daniel is something that's been missing in her life, a sexual spark that excites her, even though she dares not act upon it since she really does love Lou in spite of his foibles - including a certain apathy about their relationship that he thinks is perfectly normal. She could see spending the rest of her life with Lou, but she wonders if he is her soul-mate or whether it's worth the risk to find out if Daniel is really the one. Blinded by desires she had yet to tap in her marriage, Margot knows if she acts upon those feelings, there will come some point where she'll have to make a hard decision between Lou and Daniel. Michelle Williams captures Margot's inner conflict with palpable empathy as you see her character expose her thoughts in moments of quiet in which she is the harshest judge of her actions. It's a shining performance which compares favorably to her evocative Marilyn Monroe inMy Week With Marilyn. There is a deliberate vagueness to the two men. As Daniel, Luke Kirby (Mambo Italiano) manages to convey the lure of \"the other man\" without coming across as despicable even though it's clear he wants her from afar. At the same time, it's clear that Margot and Daniel have little in common, and they make you wonder how sustainable their relationship could be.Seth Rogen does something surprising in this film - he acts. He still doesn't stray that far away from his shaggy-dog comic persona, but he realistically shows how Lou's contentment and impassivity bring Margot both lasting security and unresolvable fear and longing. Similarly, Sarah Silverman makes her few scenes count as Lou's plainspoken sister Geraldine, who is married with two kids and an alcoholic just out of rehab, especially when she tells Margot what she thinks of her ultimate decision. That Polley can coax such fine dramatic work from Rogen and Silverman is a credit to her growing confidence as a filmmaker. As a native Canadian, she also presents Toronto as a setting with its own unique identity (versus other directors who use it as a double for New York or Chicago), and her cinematographer Luc Montpellier brings a lushness to the images that adds to the intoxication Margot is feeling. There are still flaws - the ramshackle pace adds to an already lengthy 116-minute running time, and the climactic time-lapse montage feels out-of-place for a film that had tread so lightly before. Regardless, this film should play on a double bill with David Lean'sBrief Encounterto show how mores have evolved about infidelity over seventy years. Whatever the outcome may be, the bottom line is that there are no easy answers."
B0086213XW I swear those Canadians can churn these kinds of movies out endlessly; and I can't say I'm sorry. I enjoyed watching this movie very, very much.Here's the scoop. Margot (Michelle Williams) can probably write but uses her talent to write p.r. type stuff. She's married to Lou (Seth Rogen) who writes cookbooks featuring chicken and chicken only. They live in Ontario and are good together. They have a cool, interesting thing between them, but she has some issues, some voids that eat at her. She meets Daniel (Luke Kirby) on a flight. He paints, but is afraid to display his works. Turns out he lives across the street from her and therein lies the rub as the two become interested in one another.The user reviews on this are lukewarm, but for me it was a great watch. First off, I like the set up. Of the three main characters, there are really no \"bad\" people. Rogen seems perfectly content though there may be something in the fact he doesn't want children. From the opening shot, when you see Margot out of focus, you know she will be the crux of the matter. She is generally happy but something is missing. The finger is pointed at her more than Rogen as being a villain. Daniel is a decent guy but has issues in fear and sees something in Margot. Though he respects the fact she's married, he still needs to be with her. They don't \"cross the line\" but they still do damage to the status quo.Hat's off to the set directors here. Both Morgot's/Lou's place and Daniels place are cluttered, but it's a great clutter; filled with all sorts of odd stuff all over the place. The eye is constantly wandering over things, and the color scheme is great. Colors and things that normally would not occupy the same frame in most movies are at home here. Whoda thunk that Sarah Polley would go from child actor to such an astute writer/director. This is a woman's film to be sure (note the post aerobics shower scene) and she fills the circumstances with subtle nuance. For me there was only one clunky scene in the whole film. And she interjects certain plot points in surprising ways. Oh! The sound track is really nifty too. I liked the tunes a lot and I liked the way they underscored the content.I must stop now or the length will put people off from reading it but I like this film a lot and would recommend it unhesitatingly to anyone fond of indy films."
B0086213XW Why is Margot crying at the end. Didn't she get what she always wanted? Miserable woman that she is. Adultry destroys lives!Overall, this was a learning experience for many to learn from. Josh Groden turned in a good acting experience.Why fight and try to make someone stay with you when all the adulterer wants to do is leave.I liked the movie; didn't love it, but liked 
B0086213XW A young woman must make a choice between her loving husband and her New flame. This intriguing movie portrays the 'power of love' and what can happen if you lose it. There are funny moments, serious moments, and thought-provoking moments. Acting Performance Excellent and the story grabs your attention in the beginning. A powerfully moving drama, enjoyable from start to finish. Highly Recommended!"
B0086213XW So the main female character Margot, gets exuberant over a new found male. Since we all go thru the motions after years of marriage, when the newness wears off, she feels vibrant again. Seems like this movie is a tale of you may get what you want, but was it really worth it? Definitely a slow paced movie, but watchable."
B0086213XW Sarah Polley wrote, directed and produced this little Canadian Indie TAKE THIS WALTZ and it seems t be a very personal project. Polley definitely has some insights into contemporary relationships, family, commitment, and values and she manages to transmit those ideas with success in this rather strange but in the end satisfying film.  The cast is small and tight an dwell interrelated (except for a rather inappropriate shower scene at the ladies swimming pool when the shower is filled with naked unattractive older obese women) and the three primary actors who form this fragile love triangle are exceptional as are the other two main characters whose purpose seems to be an examination of alcoholism and its effects on a family.We meet Margot (Michelle Williams) nervously coping with her fear of airports at the end of a writing assignment for a travel company. Her eyes engage a handsome young artist Daniel (Luke Kirby) and as fate would have it they are assigned adjoining seats on the airplane home.  After an uncomfortably awkward conversation we can see that there is a mutual attraction, and on arriving home they share a taxi and discover that they live across the street form each other. Sensing her attraction and being the faithful wife that she is, Margot informs Daniel that she is married and they part ways.  Margot's husband Lou (Seth Rogen) is a stay at home guy who loves cooking and is writing a book on various chicken recipes. Though Margot and Lou repeatedly tell each other how much they love each other, their marriage of five years seems more of a silly childish game than a mature marriage relationship. There is a moment when their tiresome silly word games is interrupted by a possible physical liaison but the idea of sharing love and the concept of a child is touched upon and we never find out why that is or who is trying to have or not have a family.It becomes more obvious that Margot wants to be more exposed to Daniels and they play-act in strange situations, never consummating what obviously is a mutual attraction: Margot is fanatically faithful to Lou whom she repeated says she loves. The closest they come to intimacy is Daniel's responding to Margot's question `What do you want to do to me?' - and the monologue seems to reveal hidden needs in Margot. Daniel's sister Geraldine (Sarah Silverman) is a recovering alcoholic and her child with her husband James (Graham Abbey) is beloved by Margot.  The two confide in each other and words such as Life has a gap in it, it just does. You don't go crazy trying to fill it rather summarize the tow character's inquires.  Eventually Margot decides she must explore the newly awakened feelings she has for Daniel and the remainder of the film is how that resolves: the ending is pretty much left up to the viewer.Michelle Williams continues to grow as an actress, able to say more with her eyes and her body language than she is with the script of lines. She is truly remarkable. But she is very well supported by both Luke Kirby and Seth Rogen in roles that are not easy to make credible. The cinematography by Luc Montpellier adds a sense of surreal romance to the film and the musical score by Jonathan Goldsmith incorporates pop tunes such as `Video killed the radio star' have superb secondary meanings.  Parts of the film are flimsy and irritating and unresolved, but Sarah Polley proves that she is rich with ideas that makes us look at ourselves and those we love in a different light.  Grady Harp, July 12"
B0086213XW Very accurate portrayal of what can happen in a &#34;good&#34; marriage when one person starts hitting some mental roadblocks. Michelle Williams takes us on a very human ride down married love & lust...Seth plays her husband along for the ride. It's incredibly powerful, but if you think this is going to be a really funny comedy because Rogen is in it...well, it's not. Still great, though."
B0086213XW While watching this movie, I was disappointed in places but I kept watching and was glad I did. I liked it much more after I thought about the plot and the underlying meaning.If you are looking for a fast-paced film - look elsewhere because this one isn't it. Take This Waltz takes a long time to get going. At first, instead of building momentum, we are presented with a bunch of quirky characters (Sarah Silverman, for example) who seem to just wander aimlessly around in life. But once the main characters, played Michelle Williams, decides what she is going to do, the movie picks up and the pieces start to fall in place.I agree with some other reviewers that parts of the film are way too slow and that sometimes the characters seem unrealistic. But that is part of the beauty in the film. Some people do not have direction in their lives and because of that are drawn to whatever or whomever helps give them some excitement. Unfortunately, those same people often do not bother to think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late. As one lady says in the shower scene, \"new eventually gets old.\"Now, Michelle Williams's character will annoy you to no end because she's always crying and is way too timid in her marriage. But Seth Rogen's character isn't without his flaws either.  And the actor who plays Daniel (Michelle Williams's admirer) is just as much a loser as the rest of them.I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price to view Take This Waltz, but if it's only $2 or so, it would be a good movie to have playing in the background as you clean your room or to watch while playing Scrabble."
B0086213XW Good indie movie about real life problems and young marriage.Saw this movie a while back a go on Netflix, and it stuck with me.Basically, the entire movie is about a young married Canadian couple experiencing their first serious break in a marriage.The wife becomes attracted to a new, younger, and better looking neighbor, while the husband is trying to come to terms withhis wife's placid take on their steadily deteriorating marriage (he is trying to save their marriage, while she does not really care).Good film for young couples who experience problems with their love life."
B0086213XW The film is beautiful, its landscapes, d&eacute;cor, colour...There's a shower scene at a swimming pool that juxtaposes the young bodies of the main characters with those of older women.  The scene has been described as \"ugly,\" perhaps deemed so because it was frank and not a male gaze POV.  The younger women daintily shower; the older women truly wash themselves.  The younger women gab about wanting to escape the humdrum of their lives, to which an older woman interjects: \"New things get old.\"  The younger women turn and gaze at the older women.  We are left to imagine their thoughts.  Watching the scene was uncomfortable, but refreshing.A recently sober character talks about the inevitability of their relapse.  We weigh the inevitability of the main character's adultery.  The character also says, \"Life has a gap in it. It just does. You don't go crazy trying to fill it like some lunatic,\" which is funny and strains belief given the scene.  Maybe that's heavy-handed, but the two quotations given seem to be the only saving grace of this film for reviewers who gave it 1 star, so maybe spelling things out is needed.The scenes set at the Video killed the Radio Star (new supersedes old) ride were more telling than the quotations.  In one scene, the young woman takes this ride alone.  We can assume this is a ride that she has taken with her husband a long time ago.  In the other scene, she takes her neighbour there and they share a few minutes of exhilaration in the darkness, flashing lights and loud music.  The music stops and the lights come on: the ride is ended.  They are surprised and disoriented.  We know a ride always end, yet we are surprised, resentful or seek another (which will also end).The film is what its trailer, score, synopsis and rating suggest.  You have been warned.  Strange dialogue?  It fits the film.  Boring?  Well, you see the minutiae of a couple's life.  Boredom is the setting for discontent."
B0086213XW There may be spoilers!An accomplished actress, Sarah Polley steps behind the camera for only the second time, 6 years removed from the critically acclaimed but little seen, \"Away from Her.\"  Returning to her hometown of Toronto, Polley assembles an interesting cast including Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman as brother and sister in dramatic roles.  The reason to see this movie however is another remarkable performance by Michelle Williams as Margot, Lou's (Rogen) stay at home wife.He's working on a new cookbook entitled, \"It Taste Like Chicken,\" and is constantly trying out new recipes.  Lou and Margo love each other and tell each other all the time.  But Margo is bored.  Lou isn't.  Margo wants kids.  Lou wants a dog.  They have sex, but it's pretty straight forward and at Lou's discretion.  You get the picture.  Margo, returning from a brief trip to Nova Scotia, meets Daniel (Luke Kirby) and a little playful flirtation allows them to share a cab home from the airport.  Coincidently, he just moved in across the street.  Neither is interested in an adulterous affair but they start hanging out so we all know where this is going.She falls hard and so does he, but he does the honorable thing and moves.  Nothing much new here but Polley, who also wrote the screenplay, doesn't pull any punches, either with the dialog or with the complications of a fading marriage.  Unfortunately Polley fumbles the ending.  After Margo finds Daniel, their relationship takes a full-on physical and sexually experimental phase.  This includes 3-ways (both options), all of which is pulled off on-screen, albeit briefly.  This brilliant sequence is filmed in a stylistic 360 degree camera sweep over a long period to the baritone voice of Leonard Cohen singing his \"Take This Waltz.\"  The scene ends with Margo snuggling up to Daniel from behind just like she did with Lou.  And like Lou, he shrugs her off.  A brilliant ending I thought.But, the movie goes on when Margo is called back to Lou's house.  This needless finale appears to have been shot just to give Sarah Silverman and extended dramatic scene.  In spite of this hiccup, the film has a mature, passionate resonance and is certainly worth seeking out."
B0086213XW that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels \"incomplete\" for new lovers (who will surely feel \"incomplete\".)  Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood, slept with lots of losers, then everyone who could possibly advance her career, and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution.  It's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none."
B0086213XW From pretty much the start of this movie I wanted to turn it off.  Not long after my husband said this is really lame. The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying.  The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen. The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there.  You are just watching and bam you are blasted with a bunch of full frontal beaver shots and not just for a second, but extended. It has no place at all in a movie like this and it pretty much represents the poor, juvenile quality of the rest of the movie."
B0086213XW When we last heard from writer-director Sarah Polley, she had earned a 2008 Academy Award nomination for her adapted screenplay for her debut feature film \"Away From Her\". Now finally comes Polley's second feature film.\"Take This Waltz\" (116 min.) brings the story of Margot (played by Michelle Williams), whopo is in her late 20s, married for 5 years to Lou (played by Seth Rogen), and living in Toronto. Then one day a handsome guy named Daniel (played by Luke Kirby) moves in across the street, and almost immediately Margot and Daniel start flirting with each other. The entire movie is built towards the \"will they or won't they\" question. All the other side stories, including some juicy scenes involving Lou's sister (played by Sarah Silverman), are secondary at best, as they do not move the film forward. The movie felt a bit too sugarcoated for my liking, as if I was watching some Nicholas Sparks-adopted movie.But there are several pluses that make this sill worthwhile checking out, none more so that the stellar acting performance, again, by Michelle Williams. If you just take her last 3 major roles (Blue Valentine; My Week With Marilyn; Take This Waltz), it's becoming clear to me that she is the Meryl Streep of this acting generation. Just outstanding, and she makes the most of what I think is rather uneven material. Another major plus is the (heavily Canadian artist oriented) soundtrack, which brings a bunch of great tunes, some well known (Leonard Cohen's title track of the movie; the Buggles' Video Killed the Radio Star), and others not so much (Ron Sexsmith, a Canadian treasure; Micah Hinson, Corrian Rose, etc.). In all, an uneven movie, but still worthwhile to check out primarily for Michelle Williams."
B0086213XW This review contains spoilers...!I found this film appealing in some ways but confusing in others.  I kept wondering what Sarah Polley was trying to do and then, the next day I remembered her autobiographical film, \"Stories We Tell\" which seems to me to explain the murky parts in this one.In \"Stories We Tell\" which came out the year after this, Polley reveals that the man she thought was her real father was  not, that her mother had had an extended affair with another man who was Sarah's biological father. Sarah's mother as played in that film, as well as actual footage of her, bears a strong resemblance to Michelle Williams's character.  They are both young, beautiful, blond, vivacious and sexy.  They are both artistically inclined but frustrated.  Sarah's mother was a sometimes actress and Michelle's character is a sort-of writer.  Both leave their safe, loving, respectable husbands for artist types, one a painter and one a film maker.  In Sarah Polley's mother's case she did return to the family but died soon afterward.  I had to wonder how much of this film was an attempt on the part of Sarah to make sense to herself of her own mother's behavior.  She succeeds beautifully in \"Stories We Tell\" but in this film, it doesn't quite work.The supposed moral of this film, is \"the grass is always greener...\" Or as the alcoholic sister-in-law puts it, that there is always something missing and one just has to find ways to deal with that hole.  Here the Michelle Williams character leaves her dull but dutiful husband for a more exciting one, but in the end it seems that happiness once again has eluded her and she seem to find her happiness by herself as shown in the last scene, where she rides alone on the amusement park ride.The idea that one can't look to another to fill up the empty hole inside is a valid one. The problem here is that the film doesn't really show that the second relationship is all that bad.  It seems like the characters Sarah Polley wrote took off with their own lives and left her intention in the dust.  Their romance in gorgeous and hot and totally believable.  Who wouldn't leave the poor chubby chicken-cooking hubby for the sexy, exciting, and NICE, painter (and rickshaw driver!)  Her hubby's idea of sexual foreplay is to talk baby talk, while the other guy practically sends her into orbit at their conversation over Martinis.  That and the underwater scene in the pool were the two highlights of the film, in my opinion, with the waltz to the Leonard Coehn song, a close third.  I'd almost buy the film for those scenes.So it was not all believable to me that suddenly this very beautiful romance is shown to be have turned sour.  The threesomes in bed seemed totally out of character.  This guy wasn't a cheap sleaze out for kicks and I don't think she was either.  A more realistic development to me would be that they'd have the children that she wanted and which her husband avoided having.It seems to me that the Sarah couldn't let her characters get away with their actions  and have a happy life together, that she had to make them wrong somehow.  Boo!  I saw the film more as a coming of age film for the female character.  She married the nice, safe, secure Daddy guy and they talked baby talk to each other in bed and played other silly games  At one point when  she outgrows that and asks him to do lose the baby talk he pouts and goes back to frying his chicken.  No wonder she was ready for the next stage in her development---a real, adult sexy guy who would definitely deliver.  I just think that Polley copped out by showing that romance as a symptom of the woman's weakness.  The film itself, belies that message.  I found the ending scene with Michelle alone in the amusement park ride not at all convincing, a failed attempt to make a point that she was forcing on her characters."
B0086213XW Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments. I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content. Otherwise this film was a waste of time."
B0086213XW Following the success, warm reviews and award accolades galore for her debut feature Away From Her, actress Sarah Polley has return with her second feature as writer and director. While not a masterpiece like her earlier triumph, Take This Waltz still manages to have enough interest and ambition to make it a worthy, if not a remarkable follow up. The outer crust is rich, but I suspect the inside to be hollow. Which comes as something of a shame, but I think Polley will continue to grow as a filmmaker and should defiantly remain on everyone's radar.Set in Polley's native Toronto, and following Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen), a young married couple old before their time. She, a bored wife writing tedious travel brochures, he a would-be chief working on a thriller of a book regarding the many ways to prepare a chicken dinner. Margot has a chance meeting with a handsome stranger (Luke Kirby) while on assignment, a meet cute that follows her onto the airplane trip back home ,and grows all the more awkward when they realize that they are close neighbors. He is Daniel and he leads a more carefree existence that easily attracts the attention, but more slowly is the affections of Margot. Not wanting a full blown love affair to bloom, Margot still finds herself being drawn to the more adventures and relaxed Daniel. Meanwhile Lou remains tamely unaware, with a further conflict developing involving his alcoholic sister, Geraldine (Sarah Silverman).Polley is a fine actress who hasn't always landed the plum juicy roles that she deserves, in fact it surprises me more than a little that she hasn't cast herself in any of the strong roles in one of her own films, yet. She is also a first rate director, one who understands how to direct actors, that was keenly evident in her debut feature, there is still a difference of opinion over weather Julie Christie was robbed of an Oscar win or not, but is even more so here.  This movie succeeds in spit of it's pretensions and often lumbering plotting thanks to the excellent performances.Michelle Williams is adorable as always, smart and assured playing the sort of character she's becoming a specialist in, I suspect that a lot of people will recall Blue Valentine when watching this film. The real kudos, though, must go to Seth Rogen, who is nicely cast against type, in a role that will seem familiar to many people. His Lou has done nothing wrong, he's just an observer in his own life story. The tenderness and sadness that Rogen brings to the role helps to show something I have seen before in the actor, but has largley been left neglected and that is that he's actually a pretty good actor. Also well cast is comedian Sarah Silverman who has finally found a film role worthy of her talent.The movie is also highlighted by a nifty soundtrack featuring a lott of indie rock and alternative music. Which should come as little surprise as the film was inspired by the moody song of the same name by legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, it is not as richly texture or as poetic as the song. The movie is also unfortunately lacking in the wit that can often be found in so much of Cohen's beautiful and deeply felt music. A cool place to find inspiration for a film though, see what I mean about the keen insight that Polley brings to her films.The frustrations and boredom in Margot's life is the centerpiece of the movie, told in such a low key way, to the point of banality, which probably is the point. It leaves the events of the picture to unfold a little on the stodgy side. At almost two hours it is a little long as well, a censored version released  in Canada runs 91 minutes, one must wonder if that versions play better.Take This Waltz resembles nothing more than a big budgeted mumble core movie, you know those films that are famously underwritten and developed with amateur performances and dialogue thought up on the fly, but with everyone having sex and getting naked at the drop of a hat. The sex is toned down, and Polley's script is better than that,  but the characterizations are certainty more facile. There's often not enough to sustain a real interest here, but the emotional content is strong particularly towards the ending confrontations, most of which unfold to the contraire of expectations.An uneven film for sure dealing with issues familiar to the indie drama crowd, Take This Waltz fails to avoid clich&eacute;. I have already mentioned Williams' Oscar nominated triumph in the superb Blue Valentine, which I'm sure that this will conjure up memories of that admittedly superior film. Polley's film lacks the deep perspective of that film which helped to make it so afflicting and memorable. However, the cast rises above the material, and Polley has left her script rich enough for them to find something to say even when they have nothing left to speak of. This is the ultimate success of this small, but thoughtful enough film.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B0086213XW This film lost me in the first 5 minutes, but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek. This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent.  And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent.  Totally insipid movie."
B0086213XW is not what I expected, but it made me think about it long after it ended and the three leads are fantastic"
B0086213XW This is a romantic drama about a Margot, (Michelle Williams -`My Week with Marilyn') who whilst scouting for a job crosses the path of Daniel (Luke Kirby). They share seats on the flight home and then a cab and as luck would have it he has only recently moved in opposite her house in what looks like an idyllic little road. It is quite obvious that there is a big spark going on between them but as he exits the taxi she drops the bombshell that she is married.Well as with all dramas worth their salt Daniel, who is a rickshaw puller by day and an unexhibited artist by night, keeps up the gentle persuasion and Margot does the minimum to deter his advances. Meanwhile life for Margot and cookery, writer hubby, Lou, (Seth Rogen -`The Green Hornet' and `Kung Fu Panda 2') carry on as normal with overt displays of affection and extended family life. The problem is Lou is just a really nice bloke, and a loving husband, so will she do the right thing or jump into the back of the rickshaw for a free ride or two?This is a film that whilst firmly set in the rom/drama model actually hits a few clich&eacute; land mines at the start and then goes all out to avoid them and become a very grown up story of love, relationships and heart break. There is some very adult language, frontal nudity and gratuitous smooching on m ore than one occasion.The nice thing is that all of the players are given a fair shot at the limelight and are presented as real people rather than bit players in someone else's life and I really appreciate that in a film. The sound track is rather good too with at least a couple of contributions from Micah P. Hinson, oh yes and The Buggles - trust me it works. This is a Canadian production from director and writer Sarah Polley who has made a rather good film that should appeal to all those who like a bit of reality injected into their romantic drama."
B0086213XW \"On this date at 2 pm eastern standard time August 5, 2040 I'd like to kiss you. Until then I'm married but after 35 years of being faithful to my husband I think I'll have earned one kiss from you.\" Margot (Williams) is happily married to Lou (Rogen). After meeting a man named Daniel on a trip she is surprised to learn how close he lives to her, and how quick she seemed to fall for him. She now has a choice to make, either stay in her happy marriage or take a leap and try the unknown. I have to start by saying that this is a very good but very depressing movie. Also even though Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman are in this this is not a comedy. The movie will make you feel very different feelings from scene to scene (which is the mark of a good movie). I also have to say that 90% of movies like this are pretty formulaic but this is the exception and it actually makes you wonder what will happen the whole time and the ending I have to say is perfect. Michelle Williams is great in this and I would compare this to the movie \"Blue Valentine\" in pacing and feel so if you liked that movie then this will be right up your ally too. Overall, a very good but pretty depressing movie that is very much worth seeing. I give it a B."
B0086213XW You may like it or just hate it. Whatever your reaction to \"Take This Waltz\" may be, you will admit one thing: three-time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams's great acting skills. It seems she has been doing \"serious\" movies these days - remember she was in a comedy \"Dick\"? - and \"Take This Waltz\" is no exception, a romantic story with serious themes including boredom in marriage and life. That's fine with me, but as to Sarah Polley's sophomore effort as director, I think something is not right with the film. Or, in short, I was not convinced.Michelle Williams is Margot, a happily married woman writing for travel brochures. Her husband is Lou (Seth Rogen) writing a book about chicken recipes. While travelling abroad, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby), an aspiring young artist, who happens to be living across the street. Now you know the rest of the story.Michelle Williams's emotional acting, in itself impeccable, is somewhat at odds with Sarah Polley's direction that tends to be too smart. Some of the dialogues and scenes are self-conscious of their importance, attempting so hard to serve as a metaphor or a clue as to what is going on in and around the characters, such as Margot's remarks about being \"afraid of plane connections\" or Daniel's muscular body when driving a rickshaw. In one scene the camera keeps going around two characters in a room, symbolizing the lapse of time (and perhaps their inability to move on). Some people would find these things thoughtful and intelligent. I think they are just pretentious.I see the point the director is trying to make, but in spite of (or perhaps because of) the stunning performances from Michelle Williams (the opening sequence alone is enough to prove her talent), the film looks artificial and unnatural. The film is often very emotional, to be sure, but the emotions come from her superb acting.Some films are called a \"character study.\" \"Take This Waltz\" is a study of emotion, and as such it is fascinating, perfectly capturing various phases of love. Strip away the veneer of emotions, however, and what you get is an oft-told story centering on one-dimensional characters set in implausible situations."
B008621DSM Good movie! The camera work was wonderful and it was definitely creepy.like in middle of the movie she was in that room talking to a ghost on made up RE-G-board  and  All of the sudden bed moved and he came up from the ground, WTF.. FREAKED ME OUT & JUMPED , didn't expect comes that way!What was with the green/blue eyes switching around (sometimes left was blue, sometimes the right) and also her bandage at the end...it switched back and forth too. It had to be intentional...but I didn't get it, though I definitely noticed it.After all Good acting, fascinating shots & well done creepy flick!Defiantly buy it on blu--ray for my collection ,when price goes down,is a re-watch able flick!"
B008621DSM THE PACT starts out as a disappearance mystery, turns into a ghost story, and winds up as something else entirely! Its best to go into it not knowing anything about the finer details of the story. Caity Lotz is perfectly cast as the woman who is compelled to solve the puzzle of her childhood home. Where did her sister really go? What happened to her cousin? Casper Van Dien (STARSHIP TROOPERS, SLEEPY HOLLOW) plays the skeptical cop, who slowly comes to see that something very odd is going on. Filled w/ foreboding and dread, THE PACT crawls down your spine like a chilly spider, right up to the freaky finale! A wonderful movie to lose sleep over..."
B008621DSM I can't believe this movie got by me for a while.  It was better than most widely released films of the same genre.  When I saw the stellar reviews it was receiving on Amazon, I bought a copy and checked it out.  It was a lot of fun!  Some will be a little thrown off (or even turned off) by a major plot turn that occurs about two-thirds of the way through the movie, but, for me, it was what made the movie stand out.  The film goes from being creepy to unnervingly suspenseful in its final act.  I don't want to give anything away if you have a mind to check this out, but I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this sleeper (a sleeper to me, at least).  The acting is credible enough, and there is some genuine spookiness (along with a bit of forgivable goofiness).  The direction is fine and the production was decent for its budget.  Of course, it's nothing literate, but if you're looking for a creepy good time, check this one out!  By the way, you'll also see a Casper Van Dien performance that actually doesn't make you cringe quite so badly."
B008621DSM As two sisters return to their childhood home to pay last respects to their deceased mother, they stay overnight in the house. Suddenly, their visit becomes a Nightmare of horror as what's inside begins to haunt. This is a spine-tingling thriller-horror, packed with suspense and creepy events. Scary scenes and heart-pounding events of the unexpected.  Perfect for horror and thriller lovers. Highly Recommended!"
B008621DSM I was taken in by this little sleeper of a film. Very well acted,scary and mysterious with a \"fresh\" take on the haunted house theme.It does have inconsistencies here and there....and an over-the-topand doesn't-make-sense ending, but nevertheless, this film is worthwatching. As others have said, Netflix has it for free."
B008621DSM The Pact is a slow horror film that mixes tension with jump-out scares. I don't want to spoil the scares, but I will say the movie has similar scares to the frights found in Insidious and kind of like Paranormal Activity (this is not a handheld camera film, by the way). Some of the scares were expected, but still managed to creep me out a bit. In the right environment, it should deliver some spine-tingling frights.  I have mixed feelings about the ending though, it's original but moves away from what the the first two acts built. Some may dislike the slow pace, but I felt it worked well. Acting was fine most of the time, and the music was great.For your information, the film has some blood and gore, terror, and partial nudity (nothing serious or over the top), in case you were planning to watch it with anyone under 17 (it's Not Rated, but it's pretty tamed). Worth 9.99? Maybe for fans of this type of horror, but you should wait for a drop if you're barely interested. I enjoyed it, though."
B008621DSM of IFC's latest, The Pact, is a film revolving around a young woman named Annie and her struggle to piece together mysterious happenings in the home she lived in as a child. With the death of her mother and the disapearance of her sister shortly after, Annie, played to perfection by Caity Lotz, returns home only to realize that she is not alone. With strange bumps in the night, she flees the house, but returns later and is forced to take a closer look into dark past of her family.With stunning cinematograsphy and effects, The Pact, gives more spine tingeling chills than most of the supernatural films that have been released lately. With suspence setting in just minutes into the film and not letting up until the credits roll, audiences will be holding onto their seats for the entire ride. With the disterbing imagery coupled with some excellent editing and direction, the hair will stand up on the back of your neck throughout the film. The film contains minimal gore, but the blood comes not only as a pleasent surprise, but also as an eye-opening and well done effect. You're not getting the bloody goodness of the slashers, but some very well timed suspenseful scares.Not having seen a decent supernatural horror film in a while, I am delighted to praise The Pact. With the music quing up at all the right times and the cuts being dead on, the mystery is to die for. I would be happy with a ending that cuts to black a few minutes earlier, but honestly, this film still holds up with the additional running time and does not seem to drag on. Be on the look out for this film, written and directed by Nicholas McCarthy."
B008621DSM free on netflix. looked briefly at reviews. saw the Sundance logo. went for it and i was not disappointed in the least.i went into this movie knowing nothing. it drew me in INSTANTLY and never let go. huge mystery, brilliant sound, lighting, cinematography, sets....etc...the acting was awesome.if you know nothing about this movie, go for it. honestly if i go into it i could ruin it. trust me...The Pact is AWESOME."
B008621DSM As a ghost/dysfunctional family/serial murder story, it's a heavy trip, to say the least.  And the brave/foolish surviving sibling who is determined to get to the bottom of the disappearances and confront her fears as well as the ghost makes it a scary film, to say the least.  What exactly &#34;the pact&#34; is, is not completely clear, but I have my theories."
B008621DSM The trouble with ghost stories is that they all assume that there's some sort of supernatural rule book that spirits and the like have to follow from beyond the grave. These rules change from movie to movie, and audiences are almost never given any glimpse into what they might be. The end result is that viewers think anything can happen, and therein are supposed to lie the movie's chills and thrills. For some, this works. For those who tend to think a lot, it can be distracting as more and more questions pile up in your head.And don't act like this movie doesn't want you to think. Like most ghost stories, THE PACT is essentially a murder mystery with a ghost (or two?) as characters. In this film, an abusive old woman dies and her oldest daughter, a recovering addict, disappears when she goes to the house to settle the estate. Enter the bitter, younger daughter -- Nicole -- who begins to discover that there is more to the house (and her family) than meets the eye. What follows is a fairly tense, well-filmed, decently-acted, but ambiguously-plotted search for truth that culminates in some truly creepy but head-scratching moments.Since most ghost stories become a game of Find Out Who Killed Me (or Find Out Why The Ghost Hates You), the film starts to falter as soon as most of its larger secrets are revealed. To compensate for this (I guess) this movie peppers in quite a few bizarre minor mysteries that do more to confuse than tantalize. This includes the final five minutes of the film [SPOILER ALERT: which not only include a completely unrealistic portrayal of how recently orphaned children behave, but END OF SPOILERS] which also adds a final shot that requires you to fill in a ton of blanks on your own, like a MadLibs that only gives you two words of the whole story. \"The (noun) (verb) (preposition) the (adjective) (noun).\" This includes the title of the film, which the audience is likewise required to make an entire book of guesses about.Decently directed, the movie would've been far more satisfying had it avoided the abundance of red herrings, as well as the loose threads that make me wonder if they were red herrings after all, as well as had our resident ghost played by some clear, definable rules. Ultimately, it's not a bad flick as far as ghost stories goes, but it doesn't do much beyond the same old, same old."
B008621DSM Just watched it on netflix and adding to my buy list! I love movies with some actual scary stuff in it. This also has a great storyline. I was impressed with what they did with this. Just goes to show you don't have to spend the big bucks to make something good. I'm so tired of the same old gore junk and lately I'm finding some really good scary movies thank goodness! If your looking for something that is creepy and actually has a good plot then this is your movie. Check it out on Netflix or Redbox! Like I said I'm buying it!"
B008621DSM I just want to say one thing...I haven't been freaked out like this since The Entity (not like it, though). ;o)"
B008621DSM Decent thriller - a couple of scenes didn't make sense (why didn't the ghost just kill the psycho brother?) But all in all- it's worth a watch. It's &#34; silence of the lambs&#34; spooky with a supernatural twist. Notthe best movie- but not the worst either."
B008621DSM Like most reviewers, I question why this movie's title THE PACT doesn't fit the film?!THE PACT is a ghost story and a tantalizing mystery hybrid.  Writer/director Nicholas McCarthy uses dim lighting, ominous shadows and eerie music to unravel a tale of deception, revenge and dark family secrets.  Caitey Lotz is very good as the younger sister who reluctantly returns to her homeplace to attend her mother's funeral.  Upon arrival, she discovers her older sister (Agnes Bruckner0 has inexplicably vanished, leaving her young daughter in the care of cousin Liz.  When Liz likewise disappears and Annie is attacked by an unseen force, she turns to a dissolute detective (Casper van Dien in a restrained performance) and a young psychic woman for help in solving the mystery.THE PACT does move leisurely, but I got involved anyway.  There are some plot inconsistencies and a puzzling final shot, b
B008621DSM I got this after reading all the reviews and i have to admit they were accurate. Once the movie kicks into gear, it's got enough jolts to qualify as scary good. What surprised me most was how the shocking moments were made up of simple old fashioned things: A fast camera movement, a shadow, a flickering light, a sound. It's also well cast. All the actors do a great job."
B008621DSM A fairly routine horror entry but with a story you've seen a hundred times. However in spite of the insipid plot, this one manages a few creepy moments that almost make it worthwhile to watch."
B008621DSM You want be disappointed I was really shock to see how great the movie turned out to be. It's worth the money good entertainment."
B008621DSM When two sisters come home to deal with their mothers death a horrible secret is unveiled that their mother hid. Not your typical horror story. Has one wicked ending."
B008621DSM Acting was very well done, the plot had some twists I sort of expected - but still done in a way that surprised me a bit.  It's a slow build of terror and suspense, which makes the scares all the better.  Not your typical blood and guts, slasher movie; this is a nice psychological scare.  There is a bit of supernatural in it, but the true horror is that a human being can be so cruel and deviant.  Like someone else noted, there were some minor holes in the plot along the way, but not big enough to truly detract from t
B008621DSM It was an okay movie.  It wasn't as scary as people claim it out to be.  I didn't like the way that it ended.  B
B008621DSM It had a few jumpy moments but we never figured what the pact was and who made it. It just wasn't that good. The acting was sub par especially for who the actors were."
B008621DSM The film opens with a close up of a green iris. The eye blinks and then it becomes blue. We then move onto a film that is seeming unrelated to the eye or the title.Nicole (Agnes Bruckner) is at her mother's house. The camera angles give us the feeling Nicole is being watched. Agnes Bruckner gives us a good performance as someone who is feeling creepy. Her mother has passed on and Nicole is making the arrangements. We discover this family was not very tight and has every member has numerous issues.Nicole disappears the night before her biker/waitress sister Annie (Caity Lotz) shows up. Annie occupies her mother's house and also cares for Nicole's daughter (Dakota Bright) who she has met for the first time. Weird things start to happen in the house until Annie seeks refuge at the police station.At this point an unkempt Bill Creek (Casper Van Dien) shows up. The ghost starts to leave Annie clues. The suspense/thriller/ horror aspect was good. Once you find out what is going on, it takes the film down a peg.I wasn't sure what they were trying to accomplish with the very end. It took a certain \"seriousness\" out of the production.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity. Caity Lotz legs and cleavage."
B008621DSM Annie Barlow (Caity Lotz) comes back to her childhood home to attend her estranged mother's funeral only to discover that her sister Nicole (Agnes Bruckner) has been missing, leaving her young daughter alone. Annie then experiences some weird events while sleeping in the house, when another person also disappears mysteriously.One interesting aspect of \"The Pact\" is that the house the sisters lived in looks like any other ordinary house on the street. It is not a Gothic manor house, or a cottage surrounded by woods. Of course, this is no ordinary house, as it turns out, and as we follow the process of her uncovering secrets, we learn what was really going on in the film's opening sequence.This is a well-crafted supernatural thriller, where things eventually make sense (sort of) within the context of the story. There are a few genuinely scary moments, but what makes \"The Pact\" special is the unique approach to the oft-covered subject matter, fine performances from the capable cast including Casper Van Dien and scene-stealing Haley Hudson as a young psychic, and clever storytelling by writer/director Nicholas McCarthy (his feature debut) with his smart and confident direction."
B008621DSM I am still not sure what happened with the guy and with the sister but all in all, this is good creepy fare and well acted by a cast that you may or may not know."
B0086T6RH2 \"Doomsday Preppers\" is a TV series shown on National Geographic Channel, featuring survivalists or \"preppers\". I've only seen a few episodes of the first season, but so far the people interviewed seem more rational than the characters shown in season two.For starters, these survivalists are usually preparing for a worldwide economic collapse, an event which probably will happen (although one can discuss how, when and how fast). The idea that China will pull the debt plug on the United States sounds unrealistic, while the general fears about a debt-ridden economy are well-grounded. Add peak oil to the dish, and...well, you get the picture. Even the disabled guy who preps for solar flares wiping out all electricity on Earth isn't completely irrational - apparently, a major EMP event *could* happen, although experts generally feel that it might be another 500 years until next time...The preppers in this season also seem better prepared than the hopefully scripted crazies in the second round. One of them is an elite soldier who trains his own militia group. Another is a \"soccer mom\" who tries to create an entire community network around her prepping, self-defence classes and surprisingly delicious stashed food. Elementary weapons training, growing your own food and stashing products for barter are other clever options.All in all, I would say that some of the episodes of this season (\"I hope I am crazy\", \"Into the spider hole\", etc) might give you a good look at the U.S. prepper subculture. The second season is more of a freak show, Jerry Springer style. But sure, if that entertains you..."
B0086T6RH2 I really like this show.  I am not learning anything new here but just like to see what these people are up to.  Some of them seem to be a little extreme - hence doomsday - but it is fun to watch.  If you like anything about prepping or even if you dont you will like this stuff.  Some of it does leave you scratching your head going really?  The stories follow people that are prepping for an extinction level event and what they are doing to prepare for it if you are at all curious."
B0086T6RH2 We enjoy watching this show and getting ideas,But most of these people are either wealthy or using there bill money to prep.The common pay check to pay check person could not do what these people are doing.It does make you think though about some things you wouldn't normally think of."
B0086T6RH2 I don't have really a beef with this show. Other than these people are really doing this. I do think that being prepared is important. But to go to this extent is a little extreme in my eyes. and it's kind of frightening some of the things that these people are doing. the amount of firearms shown in the homes is disturbing. And if you tend to be a worrier or you're easily rattled. this show isn't for you."
B0086T6RH2 Very interesting to see the methods different people use to PREPARE for the day the SHTF.  Though this series a family could get some great ideas to incorporate into their own prudent preparation for emergencies or the SHTF day."
B0086T6RH2 I wish this series had been taken more seriously by National Geographic. This is a subject of intrest to me but they treat it like \"oohhh...look at the crazies!\".Some of these doomsday preppers are so fat they could simply have a heart attack, while standing up from their chair, die, and feed their families with their bloated remains for several weeks. One of the grotesquely obese slobs says he has a 1 year supply of food for 7 people, which equals to one weekend at his house. Some of these people are just a bit out there (although I believe in prep to an extent) but the monstrous blobs are just ridiculous. They would be dead in the first few days of the disaster they prepare from, just because of their physical condition."
B0086T6RH2 The first part was good. Seemed liked real doomsday preppers, realistic. Next guy...he tried but not realistic, 3rd girl....umm I don't think she even had a clue what tv show she was on. I think she made everything up a day before the show filmed."
B0086T6RH2 I love DP, but I thought that this episode illustrated how bad information can lead to unnecessary problems for individuals.  The last segment about magnetic pole shift is a common misperception.  There is currently magnetic pole drift.  This is a fact known especially to pilots who witnessed a recent 10 degree change in runway designations.  This drift is occurring at about 40 miles a year and is West to slightly Southwest.  At the current rate of drift, there is no possibility of the scenario which the last family imagined.  Moreover, even if the unlikely event of a complete sudden magnetic pole shift (the south pole becoming the north pole and vice versa), the axis of the planet would not change.  For the axis to change, the best likely culprit would be a large external force hitting the planet.  In that case, no one anywhere on planet Earth would stand a chance no matter how prepared they were for doomsday."
B0086T6RH2 I was very surprised by the level of prepping going on.  People are very inventive.  If the end is coming, this would be a good place to start learning how to prep.  I wish they would have a more in depth follow up on some of the people who are covered.  I will order the second season."
B0086T706Y Necessary Roughness established itself as a heartfelt drama of a recently divorced psychotherapist who goes to work for a New York football team. As well as treating the team and all the dramas attendent to sports as big business, Necessary Roughness had a patient of the week format that made it accessible to new viewers. Terrence King, the good-hearted bad boy wide receiver is shot in the season finale and season two opens not only with the fall-out from the shooting, but with hints from other long-term storylines related to the team. The mysterious family that owns the Hawks will be more in evidence this season it seems as will the enigmatic head of security.I was surprised to find that I liked Necessary Roughness as much as I did as I am indifferent to football. But NR isn't about football, it is about people and the therapist who knows them and sometimes treats them. The performances are solid and convincing without being melodramatic and the writing is believable - realism that isn't boring or forced. I'm especially excited that some secondary characters are going to get more story-time this season and will be watching this drama develop."
B0086T706Y I really really like this show & especially Callie Thorn ~ she is a very sexy lady & I hope the show continues for a long long time."
B0086T706Y Great a really great show well thought up professional filed the writing and acting is superb. I think this may well become a classic if it doesn't move to far off base."
B0086T706Y This show is starting to loose its apeal to viewers. I have trouble getting through it, guess its hard to keep this series alive with new material."
B0086T706Y 1. I love TK's new awareness.2. I would have loved to see Nico and Dani get together. Sad Nico is leaving"
B0086T706Y I enjoy this program, but can't really say why.  I don't like sports so that's not it..... the acting is ok.... I think it's the character of Nico that keeps me watching.  I find him mysterious and interesting."
B0086T706Y I really loved this in Season 1, but found season 2 to be less enjoyable. The strength of her character made Dani fun to watch. I'm sure season 2 plots were meant to humanize her a bit and show she too, has weaknesses. I can appreciate it that, but I felt like they made her too weak and too much of her happiness was tied to the men in her life. It was a bit of a regression from the first season character. I'm still watching as of the 1st episode of season 3 so we'll see where it goes from here."
B0086T706Y This series gets a bit beyond lackluster stereotypes except for the therapy part where platitudes seem to be the cure for every ill.  Dani is an o.k. therapist, I guess, but most deluded when it comes to her own relationships.  Matt is a trip down memory lane hoping and praying for a do-over of her past.  Nico represents the future and, I wish, a much better prospect for a mature and grown-up Dani looking ahead.  These two very different men are the subtext to t
B0086T706Y Season 2 packed as much of a punch as season one with a little more spice! A great show to watch!"
B0086T706Y Interesting turn of affairs and happy that K.T. became aware of growing up and older.  Son had an expensive car which I would have taken away from him and grounded him."
B0086T706Y I had reservations about this show because it centers around a football team.  But I find it thoroughly enjoyable, with a great group of characters.  Season Two lives up to the great reviews from Season One.  Highly recommended."
B0086T706Y I title this in this way because the episode fluctuates back and forth.  Characters have their strong points and weak ones in this episode.  Although I like the series as a whole I thought this episode had its drawbacks but the viewer is the judge and not a tv critic.  The series itself though is very good I recommend anyone to stick with it."
B0086T706Y Love the Characters and the story line. I started watching because Marc Blucas was in it, but soon got caught up in the story."
B00870YQLE Deb/Jane is doing her thing again this season. Season 3 ended with Stacy telling Grayson that Jane was really Deb. I've been watching the free episodes, but when Stacy dropped that bombshell, I had to buy season 4.This season had its usual share of Ally McBealish cases. I like the weird verdicts and all of the singing - what can I say? I'm a sucker for musicals. What isn't so easy for me to digest is Brandi's role as Parker's baby mama.  Brandi will always be Brandi to me. I can't imagine her in an acting role.  Also I don't get how easy it is for Jane and Grayson to sleep around with other people when they know they really want each other. It's like two dogs in heat circling around each other.Well, finally on the very last episode of season 4, Jane is about to marry Owen (who by the way, I don't think is a good match for her), when Grayson tells her he's in love with her! They kiss, and then at that exact moment, Owen walks in, see them, clutches his heart, and....wait! I can't tell you what happened. You gotta watch it for yourself!And let's hope that there is a season 5. As of this moment, Lifetime has not decided to pick the show up for a 5th season. I guess they just like showing sad ass movies of victimized and deranged women all day. They need to get with the program and realize D3 is a damn good show!"
B00870YQLE Fabulous show great story line wonderful characters and acting.  Would have been awful to see it cancelled. Glad Sony saw the light and went to work to \"make it work\" for all concerned & mostly for all the fans out here. Would have really missed it- and there is that doozie of a cliffhanger- cant wait to see where they take that. Thanks Lifetime! Thanks Sony!"
B00870YQLE i have enjoyed all 4 seasons of the series.  it is a funny drama.  i enjoy all the charters on the show"
B00870YQLE I absolutely love Drop Dead Diva! It always makes me laugh, sometimes makes me tear up but it never fails to entertain me. My work schedule and resulting busy weekends mean that I rarely have the chance to watch shows as they air, so I record everything and watch when I can. This episode of Diva (Road Trip) came in the middle of a bad thunderstorm which knocked out the satellite. I was SO upset! Then I recalled that I'd previously found a missed episode of CSI Miami (yes, I miss Horatio)and decided to check it out. And THERE SHE WAS! The episode did not disappoint and I am very thankful that Amazon gave me a way not to miss one of my all-time favorite shows. Thanks all the way around!dc"
B00870YQLE Enjoyed this season.  I watched most of the episodes at one sitting.  Completed the remaining episodes and researched when the next season would be out.  As usual, very well done."
B00870YQLE This is one of the best series I've ever watched.  I won't repeat what everyone else has already said about it.  My only problem is TRYING to space out the episodes to make it last (in the meantime, I'm taping Season 5).  TRULY ADDICTIVE AND SO ENJOYABLE TO EXPERIENCE!"
B00870YQLE Like many of the reviewers so far, I also stumbled across this show by accident. While in Taiwan, a friend of mine was watching it and I was sucked in right away - what a phenomenal premise and set of stories. I love that this show fights fat-shaming/hatred and promotes feminism. It tackles complex issues in a cute \"Legally Blonde\"-esque way while also keeping a strong through-story about a young model's struggles in a new life. Season 4 was true to the rest of the show. It's a show with its quirks and I certainly don't love everything (Kim's and Jane's irrational rivalry, the vague role of the guardian angel, the irritating resurfacing of past relationship woes, and of course the abject lack of continuity when it comes to the obtaining Jane's memories), b
B00870YQLE I absolutely love this show!!! It's so great to have a show that isn't all focused on the sex! Amazing writing, wonderful plot, and the twists just keep coming. Not to mention the outstanding cast, they are amazing!!! I couldn't wait for the 4th season to come out to see how they were going to clean up the cliff hanger at the end of season 3!  They didn't let me down in the slightest!!  I love seeing the characters grow through the long story line arc. Yet I love the fun, unique cases in each individual episode and the growing moments they present as well. What a great show! Go Drop Dead Diva!!!!"
B00870YQLE i love drop dead diva because it it is serious but still fun and funny. i like the fact that she's an adult but yet this total girly girl."
B00870YQLE I really enjoyed this season of &#34;Drop Dead Diva&#34;.  I love the characters but do miss the previous angel. Characters are growing and developing well. Hate that Kim Kardashian is in the show. Disgusting person and lousy actor."
B00870YQLE Great show. Just wish the star didn't keep gaining weight.She is very talented and I really want her and Owen to get married!"
B00870YQLE The premise of this show isn't brand new - but it's well executed. The characters are very likable and you can't help but want things to work out for all. It's a fun light hearted show!"
B00870ZMEE This one picked up right where season 2 left off.  They bring in some fringe ideas and mix it with revolutionary thinking.  One of my favorite shows."
B00870ZMEE There problem with this series is that there is really nothing new being presented, and part of what is can be well-disputed.  It's really kind of a waste of Freeman's talent."
B00870ZMEE My headline says it all.  Do I need 2 say anymore?  I'm a geek!  I stay on the Science and Discovery channels  ...THAT'S IT!  Other than that, I download or view a bunch of stuff. Why don't they make big deals out of the launches like they did when I was younger (before &#34;Challenger&#34;)???  Can't wait, in about 6/7 more yrs we go back to the moon. :D  That's sure to be big."
B00870ZMEE Morgan Freeman seems genuinely interested in the subjects covered here.  He's the perfect &#34;host&#34; for this sort of intelligent television.  Hard to pick a favorite from Seasons 1, 2 and 3.  They are all stellar."
B00870ZMEE Next to The Universe, and Ancient Aliens, this is our favorite show.  We love how Morgan Freeman's childhood is woven into the programs to explain what could be very complicated theories.  Well done!"
B00870ZMEE It's such a good show that I barely know what to say about it.  If you haven't watched this, you definitely should."
B0087BJXM0 this show is so funny! it took me a couple episodes to stick with it, but i love it now. It's really really funny and worth watching."
B0087BJXM0 great show... i think this show couldn't get much funnier!!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
B0087BJXM0 This show is really funny and I can't wait to watch more of these episodes. The story lines are so catchy."
B0087BJXM0 Sooooo sooooo soooo super effing funny.  Please hurry and add the next season. Best show ever,  everyone should watch it."
B0087BJXM0 Liked Season 1, loved Season 2, really loved the first half of Season 3, but IMO, so far the second half of S3 is spotty at best."
B0087BJXM0 It's a funny show if your into funny bathroom comedy, The characters are great in this show...Im still watching and laghing"
B0087BJXM0 It's a funny show runs along the lines if it's always sunny in Philadelphia not nearly as clever but definitely entertaining"
B0087BJXM0 The lead trio are very talented comedic actors & writers (season 1), but as the show's creators and driving forces, they're wasting a LOT of their talents.  Some episodes or scenes are really amazing, but too many do not work at all (and I mean not-at-all).  I've suffered through several season 2 & 3 episodes that just didn't work right from the start.  I thought the first season was excellent, but seasons 2 & 3 really pushed their luck.  Like so many (failed) shows, they mistook success for a mandate to be ever more ridiculous and free-wheeling ('if this worked once, then ten times this will work even better').  Shows like this which rely too heavily on over the top, no holds barred improv & ad lib veer too close to unwatchable reality television.  I'd use all that money from product placement deals to hire some adult supervision and cut back on the added production values - much better bang for the buck.  Otherwise this show's a gonner."
B0087BJXM0 What can I say, this show is just as ridiculous as the picture. More so, I like how the characters never grow, episode after episode, they remain the same - stoners with a day job. This season is funnier than the first season.While I thought the second season was funny, it had a slower pace than the third and first and took too long to get to the climax *no pun intended*If you like slap stick comedy, characters who never grow as people, ridiculous and weird dialogue, bad rapping, then this show is for you."
B0087BJXM0 A little crude, but has some funny stuff. I can imagine  there is a office or two with this kind of personnel"
B0087BJXM0 This is one of the great &#34;stoner&#34; show of all time. Sit down with a fatty and enjoy all the laughs. Enjoy!"
B0087BJXM0 hilarious. this show is so hilarious. these 3 always remind me of working at a horrible job with friends but still having the greatest time. i love these guys and will always watch this show, i hope they come out with 10 more seasons (i know, im reachin here)"
B0087BJXM0 This show is a comedic hit that seems to grow funnier with each season.  If you love silly, random comedy, you have to watch Workaholics.  All of the characters are funny in their own ways.  Even the minor characters could easily support their own episodes.  The scenarios are fun and often gross, but no matter what they throw at you, you will laugh.  Yes, it can be a hit or miss comedic situation at times, but something funny (or potentially funny) happens in each scene.WATCH IT!"
B0087YNHNI The show is created with limited video footage and there is too much repetition of scenes to fill in time.  That is the only negative.  It is a good show revealing the day to day struggles of surviving in the mountains."
B0087YNHNI I only watched a couple of episodes...it just didn't catch my interest.Nothing bad or objectionable or horrible...just a little too staged, IMHO."
B0087YNHNI I am new to Mountain Men but after watching a catch-up marathon of season 2. I of course had to go back to season 1 on Amazon Prime. I am really impressed. I especially love watching these mountain men create something from various natural things and with primitive tools.  I think my favorite character is Eustace in North Carolina. He's amazing!"
B0087YNHNI This show could have been interesting but the writers and producers (like most reality shows) must think that the general viewing public is just plain STUPID to believe the crap they feed us.One example - One of the mountain men broke down in his snowmobile 10 miles from home in the middle of the night. Also it was -30 below zero. He had to hike back to his cabin (again 10 miles) and fetch another motor (80lbs) and hike BACK 10 miles and install it. Give me a break! All the while you could hear wolf howling in the background. Very bad sound effects. And I guess the camera crew hiked back also.Another scene, another &#34;man&#34; and his brother were hunting down a mountain lion that was coming to close to their residence. They wanted to scare it back into the mountains. They rode horseback for a few miles before coming across the lion. And when they did, they yelled &#34;shoo lion, get away from here...&#34; And the lion ran off never to come back again.Yep... now I know what I have been doing all wrong when trying to get rid of raccoon's that have been getting in my trash. I forgot to yell SHOO!!!"
B0087YNHNI This show offers an in depth look at what it takes to be self sustainable. It isn't an easy road for sure."
B0087YNHNI If you enjoy Mother Nature, you should enjoy this show.  I'm not sure that you'll fall in love with it, but I think you'll get through Season 1 on Amazon, since it's free right now.  However, it appears we have to pay for Season 2, which I would never do.  There are 3 main characters in Mountain Men.  All three live relatively different lives in different areas of the country, which is good and diverse for us viewers.  Of course, the producers of the show add some drama, which is sometimes realistic.  On one show, the guy in Alaska breaks down (his snowmobile) 10 miles from his cabin, and he has to walk the entire distance in the dark and the sub-zero temps.  Now, that was real!  I could feel his pain.  Overall, there are some decent situations and activities for these guys.  You should learn at least a few things from watching the show, while being somewhat entertained."
B0087YNHNI Hard to imagine living this way but it is intersting to see how they not only survive but enjoy it."
B0087YNHNI Staged, hokey and ridiculous.  For one thing, they repeat little segments so much each episode could be half the length.  The 70 lb snowmobile engine looks to be maybe 20 pounds.  Plus the guy seems ill prepared, and ill equipped.  Then you have the faux concern over the missing Montana guy.  His friend looks for him \"with concern growing with each step\", but when found the fellow is fine, just rambling around looking for otter sign with his dog.  He even asks, \"hey what brings you down here?\"  Indeed, what brings us to find such garbage TV as an episode.  Then the guy in NC has his rifle misfire.  Well sorry, it didn't misfire, he missed.  Supposedly because bad help sighted in his rifle poorly.  Well excuse me, if your rifle and your deer are crucial to feeding yourself, sight it in yourself or at least oversee it being done.  What crap.  Plus, during this one deer hunt he has 3 different long barreled firearms.  The shot is taken with a Ruger #1, later he is seen with what looks like a shotgun, and in between a bolt action.  Truly disgusting crappy staged for TV made up melodrama from nothing."
B0087YNHNI My favorite \"Mountain Man\" of all is Eustace Conway in North Carolina. He truly lives off the land and uses primitive means that he contrives himself.Tom Oar in Montana puzzles me: his wife was concerned for her safety with the grizzlies and the wolves coming onto the premises and Tom was going to be away selling their crafts. His solution? Bring out \"The Gun\" and teach her how to use it. Just what was \"The Gun\"? A single shot break-action .410 shotgun! He must have been thinking \"well, at least I have her well-insured!\" Any \"Mountain Man\" knows that a .410 would be no more effective against large predators than a BB gun and firecrackers.Marty in Alaska is a pessimist if I ever saw one. Perhaps with good reason though. Murphy's Law rules the roost of his home! He does seem to take unnecessary risks that in my mind, will eventually catch up to him thus fulfilling his pessimistic outlook.I do like this series! Eustace is the only one I would ever consider as a mentor. He is resourceful, tough, and a man I can (and do) respect."
B0087YNHNI Come on, I have lived in British Columbia and knew some real mountain men... these guys are NOT. Real mountain men do not have airplanes, snowmobiles, sawmills, cars or handy neighbors just to name a few things.Then on top of that the show tries to make it seem like these guys are &#34;lost&#34; or in danger when it's so obvious there is a camera crew with (for one example) stage lighting making it much easier to fix the broken snowmobile in what should be darkness. How dumb. Are we not supposed to notice that or are we supposed to think the whole crew was in such peril?On top of that, it's almost as if there wasn't enough dialogue to fill up the time slot with the same dialogue being repeated over and over ad nauseum.This must be one of the worst put together series I ever saw on TV (or in my case the Internet). I found myself watching more than just a few minutes of the first episode because I couldn't believe how poorly done it is.I could make a camping video with more realistic danger than this show."
B0087YNHNI True self reliance is shown. I have a new respect for people who love this way.  A good show that is more than mere entertainment."
B0087YNHNI I was so excited to check out this show when I heard about it! This show is great! I love that try chose to make a show about a bunch of really awesome guys doing something spectacular an against the grain for once because it seems like most reality TV shows these days are primarily based upon trash and smut. After watching season one of Mountain Men I definitely fell in love with these certainly unlikely TV stars! My favorites are Tom and Martin. My only beef with this show and this the reason I rated it at 4 stars instead of 5 is the ridiculous voice of the narrator as well as the way this show tries WAY too hard to create drama where this is none. I guess that is the ony way to keep people interested in shows these days. Call me old fashioned, but I would really perfer if they stopped making this show about unnecessary drama and focused more on the lives of these truly awesome guys!"
B0087YNHNI The majestic mountain scenery from Maine to Montana to Alaska is beautiful.  To see the wildlife in their natural setting  even seeing the hunting, trapping and killing of some is a realistic perspective and worthy of understanding.  To learn about the lifestyle of the mountain people is very interesting."
B0087YNHNI This is really slow paced show but it is interesting.  These people have developed systems to make it on their own which I find rather amazing."
B0087YNHNI You know one thing I dont understand about shows like this, you know wilderness survival and such, how come you are trying to go back to our roots and all,right?, so you use an axe to chop wood, but you have a gas operated chainsaw to cut trees down?, and you got a freaking snowmobile, but you try to make fire with two sticks?(no lighter), WTH man, I dont know what these people are thinking, including the producers. Whats the freaking point? If the point of the show is to show how they survive in the woods, using old school techniques, then why do you have a snowmobile? Why dont you show me how you survive with knife and an axe?"
B0087YNHNI So interesting to see how self sufficient these people can be. Reminds us how hard life was for our ancestors."
B0087YNHNI I enjoyed looking at another lifestyle for which people live.It is interesting to see how people  live off the land, while most of their work is survival.  There are some city folks who still do some of the same, food gathering and storage, hunting, outdoors activities, but most is provided by services. Where the services  for these people is by their own hard work.The people in &#34;Mountain Men&#34; rely on other people to help out in certain situations.  They rely on community help in different circumstances, some due to government regulation and others wildlife movement or weather.I enjoyed the personal commentary or narrative given by the people.  I felt like I was there with them visiting.This series can be a motivator to those who live in a city to get out in the outdoors once in awhile, noting some of the preparation that is needed to be outdoors in the wild along with some of the dangers involved.It's a good series.  I'd like to see more shows that deal with different lifestyles of the outdoors with some glimpses of personal struggles and successes."
B0087YNHNI Not action packed but a pleasant glimpse into what these men have to do daily to live. It's not easy."
B0087YNHNI The way these men & women live used to be the &#34;NORM&#34;.  Americans were independent, tough, self reliant, patriotic and most of all loved FREEDOM!  It is refreshing to see that some people still hold these values and are not dependent upon the almighty dollar or government to live.  Highly recommend, but only to the closet FRONTIERMEN."
B0087YNHNI This show makes wish I actually had cable.  Between mountain men and swamp people that would be about the only reason I would pay for television."
B0087YNHNI I really liked this show...Beautiful scenery. It makes me want to visit these states! Please hurry and Add another season!!!!"
B0087YNHNI My husband watches this show , and tells me all about it.  Therefore I think that he really likes it.  I on the other hand, have only seen it once or twice and it is ok, but not on my favorites list.  I would recommend it to people who like tales of how mountain men would live in today's times and how people survive in different situations."
B0087YNHNI Mountain men covers three interesting areas with pretty interesting men living off the land. One critique I had was the show would switch too frequently between the locations. That really made it seem abrupt and a little hard to watch. But it covers adventurous areas youll enjoy seeing. Good show I'll keep watching."
B0087YNHNI look into the world of people who choose to live life differently, more independent and self supporting life style with hardships that make them stronger"
B0087YNHNI I really like this show about individuals living off the land.  Helps remind us that are basic struggle in life is really daily survival and not acquisitions and social standing."
B0087YNHNI excellent series details the rugged men who live in the mountains in various areasof the country, wish they would make the other seasons prime also."
B0087YNHNI I rated this 6 stars because I thought it was very well made.  It gave a very good and detailed account of what it is like to livein the mountains.  All the struggles, challenges and highlights of a life that most of us could never imagine.  Following themen and their families was very interesting and I am looking forward to seeing Season 2!  I would highly recommend this!Lots of information and well done."
B0087YNHNI I love this show and the characters. I feel like I really know the characters...have my favorites and am so glad I can watch this show, enjoy and NOT live like this myself :)"
B0087YNHNI My kind of video. Shows how resourceful one can be in extreme conditions, battling the cruel and real elements of nature. What I don't like to much is the switching scene locations and short time on viewing the characters in this exciting and thrilling exposure to the elements of danger. Beats looking at some fictional Hollywood production. Especially the garbage that's being produced for today's films."
B0087YNHNI There is a great moment in this particular episode.There is a scene where one of the faux mountain men is working at his sawmill. They claim the sawmill is water powered. The whole premise of the show being that these \"mountain men\" are living a subsistance life in the hills by the old ways.Not only do they show that the generator is so small that it cannot possibly power the sawmill, they actually show the gasoline engine that does power the sawmill in the background. Its right there connected with belts to the sawmill.I know what reality television is. But when they give up the basics of even trying for a suspension of disbelief, its all just kind of sad. Their audience would not have thought any less of a guy running an old gas-powered sawmill and when people finally figure out that they are being treated like fools, they tend to all walk away at once."
B0087YNHNI Love the views shown in the show. It is interesting to see how different they live than most of us."
B0087YNHNI There must be a better way to make a living.  Yet, these guys love their way of life and wouldn't change it for anything.  Very good show.  Addictive."
B0087YNHNI There is nothing about Mountain Men that I don't like so I gave it 5 Stars.  This is my kind of entertainment...either doing it or watching someone do this stuff.  Can't get enough and yet, like the Profit, I think the series ended."
B0087YNHNI This a a well document series which is both informative and entertaining.The challenges faced in the wild are both eye-opening and frightful.Very well done."
B0087YNHNI This one is fun to watch. People are very interesting and their life is so interesting. Will keep watching it."
B0087YNHNI This show is interesting to me since the featured mountain men (and associated women) need to do certain things in order to survive due to their chosen lifestyle.  Still, the recaps when the show switches from one person to another are tedious.  For instance, one mountain man's dog keeps getting &#34;lost&#34; and a bear could eat it.  This goes on for several scenes but interspersed is another mountain man's need to fly his personal airplane to a remote cabin in Alaska, so viewers will be reintroduced to the &#34;missing&#34; dog scenario several times before the dog comes bounding home.  The dog goes missing twice in two different scenes - once out hunting and once at home - I found this to be contrived.To be fair, many shows do this now.  I suppose it is done to add airtime padding when no new film footage exists but I so dislike it.  For shows like Mystery Diagnosis which keeps my interest such that I want to find out what is ailing the person(s),  I record it so I can fast forward through the recaps.  What will transpire with the contrived scenario of the &#34;missing&#34; dog does not hold my interest enough for me to bother with it.  I will not be watching this show again unless I am channel surfing."
B0087YNHNI Felt like I really intimately got to know these three fellows who live on the front edge of life in the outdoors.  I certainly don't have the skill set to do what they have chosen with their lives, but what a gift to be able to look into their life and see how they are able to endure the hardships they face.  Can't wait for 2nd season."
B0087YNHNI Great show ...It tells me there are still people out there that still live off the land & shows me that civilized  life in the city is way better than living off the land....(NO INTERNET!!!)"
B0087YNHNI Really? Couldn't they have found more capable &#34;men&#34; for this series? The only one who isn't a complete &#34;mountain moron&#34; is the dude in MT. The other 2 shouldn't even be on."
B0087YNHNI Shows is good but they really need to quit the re capping ... Half of the shows is repeating what already happened 5 minutes earlier. Also hard to believe any of the drama ... Almost seems fabricates"
B0087YNHNI I have watched this on network TV and liked it. I wanted to see if there was an episode that I had missed and found I had missed a few. This shows how soft we have it at home."
B0087YNHNI Pretty good, engaging reality show. Was disappointed in the end though, because there was no real resolution with any of the subjects."
B0087YNHNI Great show!! Would like to see season two on prime. Love the scenery of each place. Can't wait for more"
B0087YNHNI I didn't expect Jeremiah Johnson but this series is so staged that, to me, it's not watchable. Does a mountain man live in a two or three hundred thousand dollar house, travel on paved roads and get regular family visits? I wouldn't have thought so. There is only one of these men who resembles in the least how a mountain man would live. The rest are so faked it completely stultified my credulity. I don't recommend this series at all."
B0087YQVY0 I loved this movie.  It was very heart warming...and redeeming.  As always, on Amazon Prime, the picture was clear and the sound was great.  I highly recommend this movie"
B0087YQVY0 The entire cast was great.  Virginia Masden is such an underrated actor, the children were all very good.  This is a FEEL GOOD family movie with a very good storyline.  Highly recommend this for everyone."
B0087YQVY0 We both loved this movie, and it quickly became my wife's favorite replacing You've Got Mail.  It's a movie that we would enjoy watching over and over.  Excellent acting and a great story line.  Wish there were more movies like this one!  To us, it's a totally enjoyable movie."
B0087YQVY0 This was a pleasant movie to watch.  About the only detractors were some totally implausible bits of the story.  The acting was superb, and the drawbacks weren't massively distracting.  If you watch it, tell me what you think of the clown resolution, the timing of the pumpkin seeds, where kids should be babysat, and a couple of kisses that just didn't make sense."
B0087YQVY0 The rest of the cast--really weak. I'll grant that the script gave them nothing to work with, but Freeman always rises above his material. I'm thinking this went straight to video."
B0087YQVY0 I really like Morgan Freeman; he seems to be especially good in movies about animals.  \"March of the Penguins\" was outstanding, and \"Dolphin Tale,\" while still being a \"weepy,\" was an excellent film.  Rarely will you find a more sympathetic character than Winter, one of the dolphins in Florida who are still worth rooting for.But Mr. Freeman and people?  Well usually they get along just fine.  But not here.  He's curmudgeony, but not curmudgeony enough.  He doesn't think much of it when a disabled kid is hopping around like a rabbit, and he's way too helpful when a little girl -- who reminds me of Abigail Breslin in \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" which surely couldn't be a bad thing -- comes poking around looking for inspiration on her next novel.  OK; maybe not novel.  But at least three difficult words of the week to appease her mom.This starring role reminds me of the character played already by Clint Eastwood in \"Grand Torino,\" a film that really worked for me.  Mr. Eastwood played it just right.  He was curmdudgeony and he was damned well proud of it.  Sure, Mr. Eastwood eventually came around, but it took huge effort and time.  And those are some things that this film, director, and Mr. Freeman should have used for inspiration.This movie is pandering, and it does one thing that a movie never must do with me:  play with my emotions.  Once you do that you lose me, and they lost me at \"hello\" (and maybe \"Welcome to Belle Isle\").  But I'll still go three because I am a fan of Mr. Freeman and Virginia Madsen, as I've said ad nauseum before.  I'm just not a fan of this film.  They should have given the dog a bigger part, as Mr. Freeman would have surely then been in his element."
B0087YQVY0 The people who were involved with this film put together a nice little magical trip into humanity. I see some reviewers pigeonhole this film as a family film. Personally, I think it is a film for everyone. I usually enjoy a good comedy, science fiction, drama, or suspense journey in a movie. This film is none of the above.I have toyed with watching this movie for quite some time. Finally, the names Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman yanked me into this magical opus. I do respect both men's abilities.I think John Lennon's words best sum up this movie...\"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.\"As for the neighborhood portrayed in this film, I wouldn't mind living there.Road Trip"
B0087YQVY0 I just adored this film. It has such a wholesome ring to it, and kids and pets, and life like we wish it were instead of like it is. Acting is good, but directing is the best. It seems to always be like that with Rob Rhyner? Gosh he's such a great director, and it shows in this film that I think you'll love, unless your looking for rap artist that can't act at all, or war, drugs and violence, then this \"ISN'T\" the film for you. I loved it."
B0087YQVY0 MAGIC OF BELLE ISLE (Dir. Rob Reiner, 2012, 110 minutes) is a nice, quiet family film that is also a Morgan Freeman extravaganza (comparatively speaking). I just loved it, but it may not be to everyone's liking in this hyperkinetic, wire-fu-violence-driven cinema atmosphere.Freeman plays grumpy, washed-up alcoholic Western writer Monte Wildhorn (great imagination with the character's name, but don't let that put you off). He decides to summer-sit a house at a location I understand is Greenwood Lake, NY - but is called Belle Island Village according to the town limit's sign. This confused me since they are clearly not on an island but at the lakeshore (someone refers to the lake), with some weird rocklike forested island (clearly CGI) off the coast, an island also called Belle Isle (or Belle Island, take your pick).By the way, Mr. Helper, \"belle le\" is the correct term for \"beautiful island\" in French. Some cultures spell it \"ille\" and my great-great grandmother, who was Belgian, might have said \"le jolie\". So I do suppose \"belle isle\" is the acceptable Anglicization; I was certainly not questioning that nor does my review even address that.Another helping hand informs me: 'As Monty and Henry ride into town, a sign is seen which says \"Welcome to Belle Isle\".' That is very good to know, I was certain I'd seen the sign in the movie but could not recall what it said. So ... welcome to Belle Isle VILLAGE, everyone! Because that is exactly what that sign says, even though the denizens call it Belle Isle.Anyway, Wildhorn has long since abandoned writing and devotes himself to guzzling booze. That is, until a fine lady and her three young daughters enter his life and cheer him right up, the end. I have to say it is a miracle and a marvel to see Freeman giving such a performance with his sadly acquired handicaps - and elements of his wheelchair-bound character reflect that loudly here.There is no swearing, no ugliness of situation and no awkward stupidity in the storyline. I see all that as major in this day and age. One bit of language is \"Jesus H. Christ\" which is so hilariously surprising I hit the ceiling laughing when I heard the lines. Fred Willard as a local eccentric certainly spices the thing nicely.Virginia Madsen hands in a worthy performance as the divorced mother of three girls, and the girls themselves are charming (with the exception of the unfortunate Madeline Carroll as Willoe Tree; Carroll is always cast as a nasty little teen witch and incidentally is some sort of cousin of my wife's).Saying which, my wife caught a gander at some of this film and sourly asked me what was so special about it. Well, I have reviewed it, it has a happy ending in spite of the wacky characters, and is fully a Morgan Freeman movie. If that doesn't tell you what is special about it, then you are a lost cause indeed.Perhaps in that instance you'd prefer a zombie-killing video game instead."
B0087YQVY0 I have Enjoyed Morgan Freeman in almost every movie he was in, and this one is no exception! He is Stunning as he plays the role as an author who lost his muse, due to his excessive drinking problem, until he meets a single mom who inspires him to return to his writing. The story is engaging as it grabs your attention, is dramatic and has funny scenes. Overall, Delightful And Entertaining. I would watch it again. Highly Recommended!"
B0087YQVY0 Overall, I thought this was a sweet film. Morgan Freeman's cantankerous character is a delight, and his friendship with the young girls who are his neighbors is cute and heartwarming. However, the abrupt romantic moments between Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman were downright \"icky\" in my opinion. It smacked of \"pervy old man hitting on younger woman\", and I didn't think that the film really built up to a relationship between them. I felt they were becoming good friends as the film progressed, and then suddenly there was sexual tension and a kiss between them? No way...I didn't buy it. That part of the plot just seemed \"off\" to me."
B0087YQVY0 A far cry from God in this role, Morgan Freeman is terrific as the alcoholic curmedgeon, Monte Wildhorn.  Monte is a wheelchair-bound writer who has lost his zest for both writing -- and living.  The healing \"magic\" of Belle Isle and his lovely bevy of neighbors transforms him and rejuvenates his soul, creativity, and life.  A very touching story!  And, the dog is a superb actor, too."
B0087YQVY0 2012PG: Every once in a great while we meet someone who makes us want to \"sit taller in the saddle\". If you're one of those people you'll enjoy this story of an old writer who's lost his reason for living then finds it in the dream of another (won't spoil the story) while searching for it in the bottom of a bottle. It's a cold heart that can't find warmth in a story about real people with real feelings. Redemption of self can take many forms the favorite of which may be to \"never stop looking for what's not there\". I hope you enjoy this beautifully written and wonderfully played gem as much as I did. MFJLabs 4x"
B0087YQVY0 This is a conventional story about a former award winning writer of western novels.  Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) has given up writing and has become an alcoholic.  He hasn't written since his wife's death 6 years earlier.  He's confined to a wheel chair as the result of an auto accident years before that.  His nephew (Kenan Thompson) arranges to have him stay for the summer at a lake house in upstate New York.His neighbor is about-to-be-divorced Charlotte (Virginia Madsen) and her 3 daughters who range in age from about 7 to 15.  The middle girl (Emma Fuhrmann) who is \"9 \" is particularly interested in how Monte creates stories.  She insists on paying him her savings (about $38) if he will tutor her.  This film is full of sugary sweetness, emotion, sentimentality and has the ability to coax moisture from tear ducts.  And it's no secret where the story's going. So what!  It's all worth it to watch the always good Madsen and especially Freeman, do their thing.  Listening and watching Freeman deliver the eloquent words of co-writers Rob Reiner and Guy Thomas are enough for me.  This is a soft, gentle story that many will enjoy."
B0087YQVY0 I loved this family movie.. A feel good happy movie..."
B0087YQVY0 Heart warming, gentle, witty, and subtly outrageously funny. Morgan play a sweet curmudgeon whose heart slowly melts each day as he spend more time in the Belle, a truly magical place where goodness is brought out in the most cynical of people. Virginia Madsen plays a wise, patient and loving mother of three very different daughters. Other characters on the island are quirky but good solid people. Makes one wish she could live in the Belle for the rest of her life."
B0087YQVY0 \"I respect consistency\". Author Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) says it best, if I were to refer it toward the apt direction of Rob Reiner, in this melodic and poetic spin on this movie.Rob Reiner weaves a story throughout a story, while Freeman and Virginia Madsen (Charlotte O'Neil) dance triumphantly within it's web.  The movie is candidly real, hopelessly romantic, and overwhelmingly personal.  I laughed out loud and was just as moved to tears all through.Just a simple plot, with a burnt-out, disgruntled author (alcohol swilling and unflinchingly sarcastic) and a struggling mother (positive and beautiful although lonely) next door. In this setting  there is nothing new.  There is, although, so much depth to the main characters, the people of the town riddled throughout and in Wildhorn's life.It is in this that makes this particular movie so worth your time; The ride from point A to point B.What first may appear to be predictable may not end in the way it will seem at the outset.  This is a movie of the heart; one that has the power to tug tightly on the emotions of those who are prone to love these types of films.Monte possesses the most foul attitude because of life's mis dealt cards that he's holding. As he moves into a new town for the summer, he begins to meet people (usually on his terms) and slowly begins to see people for how they really are.  He may be in a deep grip of emotional pain in the beginning of the movie, although so are so many others in their own lives.Charlotte, living next to Monte, begins a guarded then easy friendship with him.  Her three daughters are interacting, with a first uncomfortable Monte, soon after as the author side of him begins to appeal to all of them in different ways.The dialogue in this interactive movie is stellar, quick-witted and lovely.  Reiner uses visual stills that are able to pull as much emotion as any compelling conversation.  Of this, I so enjoyed the careful framing of faces and objects as basic as Monte's typewriter.I found also that the music in the movie is as inspiring as any of the delightful characters.  Of definite noting is the Soundtrack, with a featured solo piano by Marc Shaiman.  The high standard of the music is worth the while to listen to through the end credits.This is storytelling at it's pinnacle.  You will laugh, cry, ebb and flow through this piece of cinematic Magic."
B0087YQVY0 \"It don't happen often but sometimes we do bring out the best in each other.\" After the death of his wife famous writer Monte Wildhorn (Freeman) stops writing and takes up drinking. He moves into a lake house to escape everyone and relax. After meeting his neighbor Charlotte O'Neil (Madsen) and her daughters he begins to change the way he feels about life. One of the biggest problems I have with movies is that about 70% of them are so predictable that after ten minutes you know how it will end. Sometimes that affects how good a movie is and sometimes it doesn't matter. This movie is the later. After fifteen minutes I could have written the ending myself and it would have been identical to the way this one ended. All that said this is a great movie still and Morgan Freeman is about the only actor who can take a very ornery character and make you like him even at his worst. There are not many non-cartoon movies that are great for the whole family to watch. This is one of them. Rated PG but this is still something that you can put in with your kids and not have to worry about what they are seeing. This is a perfect example of how excellent a movie can be simply by using the best actors you can find and having a great idea. No special effects or nudity or swearing. What a strange idea. Overall, a superb family movie that I highly recommend. I give it an A."
B0087YQVY0 The Magic of Belle Isle is one of those quiet movies that sneaks up on the viewer and captures one's attention, not letting go till the final credits roll. I only watched this yesterday, though I can't fathom why I let so much time lapse after its release before watching this stellar production. I absolutely love this film - it is beautiful, has an excellent cast, and touched my heart and soul.Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorite actors, plays author Monte Wildhorn, a widower who has seen better days. Grieving the death of his beloved wife, Monte has not written in a while, and drowns his sorrow in drink. He rents a lakeside cabin for the summer in the lovely picture postcard town of Belle Isle, where his sole purpose is to wallow in self-pity. Even his nephew, Henry (SNL constant, Kenan Thomson) can't seem to lift Monte out of the doldrums, and leaves him to his wallowing.Monte soon learns that he may want to shut out life, but life has other plans, in the form of next door neighbors comprising a single mom, Charlotte O'Neill (Virginia Madsen) and her three daughters, teenager Willow (Madeline Carroll), nine-year-old Finnegan (Emma Fuhrmann), and Flora (Nicolette Pierini). Charlotte is facing some challenges given her newly-divorced status - her ex-husband is never seen but viewers get the sense he is not a loving or engaged dad and teenager Willow rebels, acting like a brat and being mean to her mom and siblings.Despite himself, Monte is drawn to the O'Neill family - Finn pushes her way into his life after discovering Monte is famous for his Western novels, and pays him to teach her how to be creative. Charlotte senses Monte's underlying loneliness and invites him to dinner where Monte discovers Charlotte's talent for playing the piano. Gradually, these individuals form an informal family of sorts and Monte learns that life is certainly meant to be lived with purpose.This is a 'quiet' film - it moves at a leisurely pace but never feels like its plodding or meandering, there is a sense of purpose to every scene, even when secondary characters fill the screen, like the young mentally- challenged boy who befriends Monte and whom Monte takes under his wing, taking him on his weekly jaunts to the local grocery store, and being a real friend to someone who is so easily deemed invisible by many others in society .Both Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen are perfectly cast in their roles. They share a credible, heartwarming chemistry that is just warm and beautiful. The actress playing the role of Finn shows promise and delivers a spirited performance.There is a hint of romance here, but it is so subtly portrayed it never comes across as contrived, but as credible and oh so sweet. It is as much a tale of finding one's self as it is a story of two kindred souls, and I for one will be placing this on my \"worth repeat viewings\" list."
B0087YS8NC I had not been interested in seeing this movie,but watched it after  reading all of the positive reviews. I stayed with it,but basically cannot understand why people liked it to the degree that they did. Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman are obviously excellent actors but their lines seemed stilted to me and they did not seem to melt into their characters. The three girls who played the daughters did a very good job.It's a  \"cute\" movie that I would not recommend."
B0087YS8NC I like Morgan Freeman films.  Thought wasnt sure on this one.  Mom wanted to watch it turned on very good movie."
B0087YS8NC Just a very enjoyable movie with excellent acting and a story that moves well.  Great family fare as well. Light but very pleasant movie."
B0087YS8NC Morgan Freeman plays a great part and the movie is worth watching. I didn't get to see this when it was in the theaters. Glad it was available through prime."
B0087YS8NC This is a feel good movie.  Not everyone's favorite type.  There is a feeling that you've seen it before and it unfolds in a predictable way.  But it is very well done, beautifully acted.  Morgan Freeman, always good, is at his best.  Virginia Madsen and some good \"kid actors\" give quality performances.  So sit back, relax and allow yourself to \"feel good.\"  You can get back to violence and sci-fi horror soon enough."
B0087YS8NC This is a great movie to watch. Sit on the couch, grab a blanket and cuddle with the with as you sip on glasses of bourbon and watch Morgan Freeman tell stories. He has such a wonderful voice to listen too."
B0088LTU54 This is a fun way to end an evening before bedtime. The 3rd season has well defined characters.Don't look for any great social message, this show is for amusement."
B0088LTU54 Previous seasons of The Glades have had a long story arc as well as the murders of the week. Season 3 didn't have this longer arc, with the exception of Jim's relationship and the season is a bit lackluster because of this lack. The murder of the week is of a surf enthusiast and sponsor who is found dead on the beach and who was involved with a family of surfing foster children.Jim is frustrated that Callie's medical school commitments are taking so much away from their relationship. His erstwhile new partner confesses her attraction to her and Jim decides to take final action with Callie. The season ends on an emotional cliffhanger. A fair episode and The Glades remains an entertaining procedural but the show should be deepening in its third season with other arcs and sub-plots that enrich the murder of the week and Season 3 of the Glades didn't deliver this depth."
B0088LTU54 Season three gets better, not worse, for the Glades.  This season has more creative mysteries, more Florida fun, and less of the serious relationship drama stuff that gets in the way.  More of what's good, less of what's bad.Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, there are some truly groan-worthy moments of predictability.  This is all part of the fun with Season Three.  It absolutely is an antidote to a hard day at work."
B0088LTU54 The fun twists that were part of the first two series are not as present in this series still very good but not great"
B0088LTU54 The plots have a lot of twists and turns in them to keep you guessing until the end. An entertaining series that so far hasn't gotten into the stale trouble of other similar programs."
B0088LTU54 the plots and writing are getting thin but the babes are great.Of course, here in Florida I assure you most of the girls are about 100 lbs. beefier.I still am entertained thought so I watching all the remaining episodes/"
B0088LTU54 i've followed this series from the first season and collected each one. it is a good show and i hope it continues."
B0088LTU54 enjoy the scenery beaches etc. like the people that are in the show and the stories are believable and interesting"
B0088LTU54 this is one of the greatest shows you have on prime t.v. I love the plots and jims way of solving crimes is entertaining."
B0088LTU54 I gave this series three stars because I like cop shows.  This was one of the poorest because it was so predictable.  Towards the end of the series I was quoting the lines and timing myself on how fast I could figure out who dunit.  I was successful within the first fifteen minutes of the show.Kiele Sanchez was the worse.  She can't act, she has no personality and she is really hard to look at for forty minutes.  I kept hoping they would replace her but no such luck."
B0088LTU54 I loved this show.  Have watched all episodes but am now stymied because I can't continue watching without paying for the final season  I would prime yourself for the fact that the series is going to be over for you at the end of season 3 unless you're willing to pay for the last season"
B0088LTU54 Slowly but surely the soap opera infiltrated the show and less and less mystery. I hope season 4 is not all washed up."
B0088LTU54 The first and second seasons of The Glades were very good but the third season was OK because the storylines were a little bit boring."
B0088LTU54 THIS SHOW IS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.  THE LEAD ACTOR IS ATTRACTIVE, HILAREOUS, AND WITTY.  OTHER CASTS MEMBERS ARE INTERESTING, ESECIALLY THE ME.  I HIGHLY REC0MMEND IT!"
B0088LTU54 I would have rated this higher but there are NO SUBTITLES!!!  I should have read previous reviews AND I &#34;should&#34; have noticed that it was DVD-R, printed on &#34;demand&#34; (and they NEVER have subtitles). So what's up with DVD-R on &#34;demand&#34;?!  I was just looking forward to getting season 3 - I didn't read the reviews because I had seasons 1 and 2, and knew the show.  One of the first times I've felt ripped off but I should have been paying more attention - my bad.  The show itself is fine, but they talk awfully fast and REALLY could have used subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired!"
B0088LTU54 Glades is worth watching because the lead actor plays a role that is enjoyable. In fact all the characters, even the bad guys and gals are enjoyable. The stories are thin but who cares when every other woman is in some kind of swimming apparel.  The production is sloppy beyond imagination. Continuity errors abound and very little is given to accuracy of facts or the way things are done.  For instance, a bureau chief (Jennifer) would not have dressed as the producers had her dressing only to show off her body. As bureau chief she would have had more control over Jim - but that would take the fun out of the show.  This show after all in just another T&A show for both boys and girls.  But like we said, it's worth watching for the enjoyment factor.  The only character that stays within the lines is Cal.  The rest seem to have the freedom of not having a policy manual or a section on proper dress was omitted from the one they have. But we like the show...what guy wouldn't enjoy all those T's and A's around."
B0088LTU54 What can be said about a warm, muggy climate with steamy relationships interwoven with murder and mayhem? I just really like the show as it keeps you engrossed and not too cliched ."
B0088LTU54 We watched Season 1, 2 and 3 on Amazon Video Stream.  It gave us hours of entertainment.  We loved the characters and stories.  We highly recommend."
B0088LTU54 The glades, I thought at first referred to the location, yes. Also there is a prison there called The Glades, in real life. The cast ismostly young and so far I haven't been convinced that the series will last. I hope it will as it shows promise and the location isnice to look at. Drop the neon back lighting, ...looks too much like Miami Vice series. The main characters need some more backbone, but like I said, they are young and will develop.  So far, so good."
B0088LTU54 I changed my mind about this series. I didn't care for it the first time I watched it. Now I have watched three seasons and am looking forward to watching season four on A&E; tonight.This show appeals as I like mysteries/police dramas. The main character is somewhat different than other detectives. He's a friendly loner who doesn't play well with others. Not cliche, though. The long term plot and presentation style are really good. The detective meets a woman in season 1 and that relationship twists through the seasons. Its a healthy relationship with some odd quirks. The woman has a son and his treatment of the boy adds to the appeal. Beyond that, the story has the usual murder aspects of a detective series but is not gory. There isn't a lot of violence. It doesn't get its ratings from unnecessary sexuality and no nudity. It could be watched with the family."
B0088LTU54 Wish I could find season four on DVD rather than digital.  Really bummed that A&E cancelled this and keeps all those other goofy 'reality' shows"
B0088LTU54 it 's interesting to see the cases and character growth the season and hopefully more seasons to come thanks you"
B0088LTU54 Good story lines, and likeable characters.  By the time that we get to Season 3, however, I got the feeling the character of the lead man was weakening, and I could not finish all the videos."
B0088LTU54 I think that the show has a great mix of characters.  I love Jim's eye rolls and sarcasm along with the chemistry with Callie.  I just hope that the writers don't mess with that.  Sanchez and Daniel are a good combination.I heard that it is continued for another season.  That's great!"
B0088LTU54 MINOR SPOILERS:With Callie now in Atlanta, the whole Jim/Callie dynamic is borderline annoying. The cases are still interesting, as is Jim's repartee with Carlos and Daniel. One reality check is in nearly every episode Jim verbally accuses 2-3 innoncent parties of being guilty where in the \"real world\" it would be construed as harassment.Welcome Taylor Cole (Jennifer) who joins the show as a Supervisor sent in to evaluate Jim's success rate while coming up with solutions to make his cases more trial-able. Jennifer is a raven haired beauty that is smoldering hot and has a knack for wearing heels and short skirts even in the most inappropriate of places. Since IMHO, the show itself is not any better than the previous season, I have to believe that the additional +-100k viewers per episodes are all her!Maybe it is an optical illusion, though I swear that Callie was filmed this year at odd angles, which is generally a sign of pregnancy or weight gain? Then again, will all due respect to Kiele Sanchez (AKA Callie), there are solid reasons why you rarely see her in the same frame as Taylor Cole!Without giving away the ending and under the guise of full disclosure, I may have removed 1/2 star from my rating for the simple reason that Jim took a pass on an impassioned plea by Taylor Cole when she essentially offered herself up!In sum, an entertaining show that may have lost a step in season 3, I can only hope that Ms. Cole reappears in Season 4 or I don't know if I will be compelled to tune in."
B0088LTU54 Same fun show but this season lost a little something.Not as fun as the last season but still fun to watch."
B0088LTU54 he is just plain awesome.  he doesn't even have to say anything.  just stand there.  this show should go forever."
B0088LTU54 This is low key but enjoyable for a cop show.  The characters fit well and the love story is being developed at just the right pace.And it is in Florida where not many shows are based since Miami Vice.  Enjoyable."
B0088LTU54 I have loved this show since the first season.  I hate the wait but that is just what I do so that I can buy the DVD set and watch an entire season at my leasure.  The storylines are good, and there is humor and romance added into the whole of the story.  The actors are all great."
B0088LTU54 This season of glades keeps you coming back with drama, comedy, and romance. Worth checking out. We are read too watch the next season."
B0088LTU54 I have watched this series and have the first two seasons and watch them over and over. The acting is so delightful and I like the mystery and humor combined. Reminds me of other series like Columbo, Murder she Wrote, etc. I do hope this series will continue for as long as the others. I look forward to each and every episode and watch the reruns and my DVDs all the time. I will purchase the next seasons as they come available."
B0088LTU54 I look forward to each episode.  The main plot is usually quite complicated and the side plot with the romantic stuff is pretty well done. I enjoy it all. I also enjoyed seasons 1 and 2."
B0088LTU54 I have found this show to be light entertainment on our South Florida area.  It has murder, love, deception, and all the things that make me happy in a show.  But on a light scale, so I can watch it and still sleep at night."
B0088LTU54 Every season, I wait to make sure The Glades is coming back. I love the series and its wonderful cast, especially the witty Matt Passmore."
B0088LTU54 Good series so far"
B0088LTU54 I buy the series but have not had a chance to view them yet while they are still being shown on TV"
B0088LTU54 I liked the first season of this series, it was somewhat original and quirky while being a bit stereo typed, the &#34;bad cop turned good&#34; and the &#34;conflicted girl with a heart of gold and a past&#34; set to a Miami Vice theme, alligators, Armani suits and bikinis. The second season wasn't bad, even though there was a strong sense of &#34;I've seen this before&#34; and the super hot woman police inspector/supervisor didn't work at all. By the third season this series has simply become an excuse to show hot girls in bikinis, there is no pretense of a story or anything resembling a mystery or a thriller. It's almost as if the writers got bored with it. Nicely produced, well filmed but the story got lost in a hot tub........."
B0088LTU54 This one is also fun to watch. The people in it are very enjoyable and funny. Can't wait til more episodes come out. Hurry and get them and lets get started on them."
B0088LTU54 Season is light hearted with multiple story lines. Sometimes Mr Longworth can stretch the realities of the law. Show does stretch Fla geography by trying to make every town less than 1/2 hr apart but this show is about entertainment."
B0088LTU54 I love this show!I am a Amazon Prime member and I am willing topay the new price.  Just wish you would put on more seasons forprime members."
B0088LTU54 The show is fine but again ten episodes? Not much of a season. And no subtitles for the hearing impaired."
B0088LTU54 We've followed The Glades ever since it started and it seems like Jim is a long lost friend - can't wait to see more..."
B0088LTU54 I liked the characters, all of them.  The writing was excellent regarding plot, action and dialogue.  Having an entire season at one time,  I continued through each episode, looking forward to the next.  Intriguing."
B0088LTU54 We no longer have cable, so we use Netflix and Hulu if we want to watch something. I liked season 1 and Netflix only had seasons 1 & 2 so I bought season 3"
B0088LTU54 Again, each episode holds my attention from beginning to end.  I sit up at night to watch another episode.  I would recommend this show to anyone to enjoys detective shows."
B0088LTU54 I truly wish there were more episodes of this series it was very good and I enjoyed the uniqueness of the character. It definitely left me wanting more"
B0088LTU54 Really like the series. THe cast and their characters make for an enjoyable 40 minutes. It's a little light on the police and detective work intentionally, and instead showcases the characters and their interactions with just enough light humor ."
B0088LTU54 I have enjoyed all 3 seasons of Glade.  Not only is this a 'who done it', but there is humor as well.  There is a weekly plot along with the lives of each of the cast which keeps going throughout the season.  This is truly an intertaining show.  Recommend this show."
B0088OUTLA CRAZY, INTENSE AND ANNOYING!! All in one.. Gotta watch season ever.. Can't wait for season 2 of Mob Wives Chicago."
B0088OUTLA I think the show could be improved a whole lot. The ladies get into a fight and the cameras capture every angle - just goofy quick shots with funky camera angles. This is an obvious and overused method to simulate fights without having to choreograph the action or use stunt personnel. You can't for a moment suspend belief.This demonstrates how the show is organized. It's a certainty that even the smallest arguments are scripted. Simulated drama was unnecessary. Meaningful drama would have emerged with more filming and editing (i.e., a bigger production budget).These are all smart ladies. They are not glib like this in real life - the opposite. It's difficult for me to continue watching more than ten minutes at a time despite my liking each of the women.Nevertheless, there are redeeming aspects. The way the ladies talk probably couldn't be highly scripted. They talk like their fathers and uncles from the Outfit. They use old expressions that still capture meanings and convey not only street smarts but a little old world wisdom.Too bad the women are presented as high-maintenance brawlers. Unfortunately, what these women can tell us from their experiences has been caricatured."
B0088OUTLA than with all the glamour attached to the males in the mob -what about the women: the wives, the daughters, the loved ones ???  Thats why I like the Mob Wives series, because it does address that question. I couldn't completely dip into that whole sugar bowl in 'The Sopranos' about how mob guys have all these different negative psychological qualities that make it all about them, but then again, when I look at shows like this, it makes me dig my spoon deeper into the silverware bowl, because - how could you not pay child support?! go for custody, when you're a felon?! Not even consider how this might negatively impact your family?!In addition to that, I'll be very honest - I love the whole fashion thing they have going on!  Its like Fashion News Illustrated AND live AND real people :)And Leah DiSimone - if I was fully me, fully the lady I was in my 20s and 30s, we would be BFFs - sooo much in common!"
B0088OUTLA Why is this show gone forever? I was so looking forward to next season. Leah was my favorite! I'd rather them cancel the OG mob wives."
B0088OUTLA Good grief girls grow up!!!!! You are putting Chicago in a horrible light, We  watched only because we are from Chicago, but we couldn't stop laughing  their antics were crazy.  Leah and Wolf were my favorites. Love the faces that Renee makes."
B0088OUTLA What song is played in the beginning? I look on YouTube and I guess the tv version has a different version then the one on Amazon instant video. HELP!"
B0088OUTLA Enjoyed this series,  Mob Wives Chicago but didn't find it as well tuned as the Mob Wives New York.  A good series never the less."
B0088OUTLA This is not as good as the original MobWives.  The characters are boring.  The first or second episode the woman were fighting, cursing, and pulling each others' hair out.  I'm not watching any more episodes.#notmycupoftea"
B0088OUTLA These women take the word crazy to a whole new level. Very entertaining.I think they must live for drama. lol"
B0088W9P9O My God! Is there any way to see this show uncensored?  This really sucks with BLEEP! BLEEP! every 30 seconds -- and the bleeps are LOUD.  In the UK, their 'F' and 'S' words are NOT censored.  AND you can buy other Hell's Kitchen DVDs and they are all uncensored.  The constant bleeping really takes away from enjoying this show.  I was going to wait until this came out in DVD (uncensored).  But I like Gordon Ramsay so much that I could not wait the full year before this show is released on DVD (uncensored).  I'm not sure if I'm going to finish watching this."
B0088W9P9O This is not a contest of who is the better English Professor.  Sorry....Hell's Kitchen this year I think is very different in some ways and the same in others....In past years, and I have seen every season, and own every season, You can a lot of times see who might get to be in the final four, if a little harder maybe the final six.  This year, the cast of chef's are so different, I can honestly say it is really fun to see who will start to emerge as a front runner.  Usually you can tell at least one person by now who might be there near the end. Not this season.  They all seem to be chef's without a clue!  lol  Which I love by the way.  The Personalities are very vast and it makes for interesting television. Now I believe in many seasons they make the guys seem to be a bit nuts where \"their lights are on but nobody's home\".....Well there has been a shift in the last few years where the woman are now the ones who are clearly off their rocker.....This is not a put down.  It is simply good television and fun to watch.  Also, this season, they are not pushing sex as much which honestly, I am glad about. Every show usually has sex in it, or eye candy for men and woman.  This season, it is just about the best Chef for the Grand Prize, which is working directly for Gordon Ramsay himself.  This is not for another restaurant, this is a direct executive position working for Gordon Ramsay.  And of course the first year salary of 250,000 dollars.  But this is only for the first year.  Now, the challenges are similar, some of the guest Chef's are similar, and the one thing I do like is that Gordon Ramsay does seem to do something good for our troops in different branches of our armed services.  No matter what our political views are, I think we can agree it's nice that they give the troops a nice treat by feeding them and thanking them, and celebrating the sacrifices they give up.  Gordon is as explosive as ever and maybe going for a record in throwing people out of the kitchen.  There is more lying and back stabbing going on with the contestants. In the end, as it is more of the same, it is every much that different.  Gordon was giving an interview about the contestants and asked what he thought.  I have to preface this by saying people who do not know the show have a tendency of saying \"they make the same food all the time and it's not different\".  Well, that is true to a degree.  Gordon said \"they come in thinking they practiced the dishes before they enter the contest and they think it will be easy.\"  Gordon laughed.  The truth is, learning how to make the fine dining food, and perfecting it, and putting it out perfect while on the line every single time, is almost impossible to do.  The two left that can do it the best and adjust the quickest fight for the title.  Also, they do not make the same exact food every night. There are many nights where they do different types of food from comfort food, children's food, to different cultural types of cuisine, and then finally right down to breakfast and burgers......Hell's Kitchen has everything.  And by the way they were just signed for season 12 and 13.  Hell's Kitchen is also in primetime up against other good shows, and it has been compared to Top Chef, which is on cable tv, and has not been on as long as Hell's kitchen and has not been signed for the type of extension that Hell's Kitchen has been.  I feel Hell's kitchen is as fresh as it's ever been and as fun as it's ever been.  And this season is great because they are all a bit eclectic and from all walks of life, and so far there is nobody who looks like they can cook!!!  lol lol  So it will be fun to watch them evolve as they get to the finals.  If you like Hell's Kitchen, You should take the time to watch.  You just cant go wrong.  It has everything....Just a side note, Masterchef is doing well, kitchen nightmares was also resigned, and we have \"Hotel Hell\" to look forward to as we head into July.  Enjoy everyone...Also, if you really want to understand the man himself, Gordon Ramsay, get both his books about his life.  You can get them for less than two dollars. And that will change the way you view this man forever.  He truly is an amazing hard working man.  And more importantly, a great family man."
B0088W9P9O Season 10 of \"Hell's Kitchen\" was well-produced and kept up suspense week after week. The main memory I have of it, now that it's over, is that this was the most mean-spirited group of competing chefs ever. Of course, they're all competing for a life-changing prize, but in all previous seasons there was at least some sense of fun and camaraderie, a \"we're all in this together\" attitude. Not this time! The situation got to the point that a few times they simply could not work together, so the kitchen had to be closed with diners going away hungry.Also, I wonder about their qualifications. When you see a supposedly trained chef week after week failing to cook sauteed scallops correctly, it gives one pause! It's not hard. I've done it. What gives?Each episode reeked of meanness and animosity. I hope that Season 11, if there is one, has competitors with at least a bit of humanity and humor about them."
B0088W9P9O this was a very good dvd to watch.i had no problems with these people at all,i would recomend you to buy this.very good to watch if u never seen."
B0088W9P9O I found Chef Ramsay's screaming extremely hard to take. I had not watched this series before, and I would not purchase another year's version. What I did like about it was that more attention was given to actual cooking than on other similar reality shows. And I liked that when it got down to the final three contestants, Chef Ramsay was very kind to all. But before that, I found him angry and demeaning and I can't help but think his approach made it more difficult for everyone involved."
B0088W9P9O I will let you know when I have fully reviewed the series.  I have seen all of his other series and they were 5 star, but you will have to wait a bit."
B008947J8U I started watching Longmire because it's filmed in the state of New Mexico and I have friends there.  However, I continued to watch it because it's the old fashioned kind of western with a modern day twist.  Longmire reminds me of people I know in the Southwest, warts and all.  Lou Diamond Phillips makes a nice counterpoint to Longmire's character.  The plots are tight and the characters are well drawn -- no one is a cardboard characture.  The topics are modern day problems such as religious tolerance and the drug trade.  You get the feeling that if Marshal Dillon had lived in modern times, he'd be just like Longmire.  Bottom Line:  Highly recommend it.."
B008947J8U Really good story...good acting...GREAT show! I do hope this show gets many more seasons! Not enough good shows on TV nowadays."
B008947J8U This is an outstanding mystery series!  It has many, many sit-on-the-edge-of your seat moments throughout.  We are waiting with bated breath for the next series to be released!  The plots and acting are excellent."
B008947J8U Longmire's character has the same gritty approach to a sheriff's role as the Western I grew up watching in the '50's.  Long suffering but dedicated to bringing justice to his county."
B008947J8U The characters in Longmire seem so real.  The situations of a rural county are so different from city life, you get a new perspective."
B008947J8U A cross between a Western and a Police Detective story, it has a unique style that doesn't feel copied.  The characterizations are different than typical police shows, and I found myself growing fonder of the actors with each episode. I haven't read the books, but the TV pilot has me wanting to do just that. My complements to all those involved in creating the pilot, it was excellent and has me wanting more.  The cast is super, with many recognizable faces including Lou Diamond Phillips. Personally I think he is underrated and deserves larger parts, but I'm glad to see him in Longmire. The pilot is like a movie and if nothing else I recommend you buy the pilot like I did.  The cost is low and the production values are high.  The writing, directing, acting, and camera work is first rate.  I plan to buy the whole series. If you like this checkoutTom Selleck: Stone Cold.CA Luster"
B008947J8U OUR FAMILY HAD REALLY COME TO LIKE THIS SHOW,  SO GLAD ITS OUT ON DVD, SO WE CAN WATCH AGAIN"
B008947J8U i ordered this for my mom for her birthday,and she loved it so much that i bought her the second season also..i would recommend it to anybody who likes this show"
B008947J8U I had read all of the Longmire books before buying this.  I did not like the adaptation in the series at all.  My neighbor who has only seen the series and not read the books likes it, but I was just very disappointed."
B008947J8U I love the feeling of this show. It makes me want to move there! The characters are honest and the story doesn't add unnecessary fluff. It's interesting. It's intelligent. I'm eagerly awaiting Season 2! ...Where IS Season 2, anyway??"
B008947J8U Taking a popular fictional series and adapting it to fit a one-hour television format has to be a daunting task.  Sure, it's been done with some success such as Robert B. Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone or Tony Hillerman's  Chee & Leaphorn novels (though except Spenser the other's were 2-hour movies).With A&E;'s \"Longmire\" they have taken Craig Johnson's present-day sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming and brought him to the small screen.  If you never read Johnson's excellent stories you probably wouldn't find much to complain about.  But, as other reviewers have noted if you have read them you are in for a disappointing and befuddling experience.Casting is key; Robert Taylor looks the part of Walt Longmire.  For the most part the actor does a credible job portraying the character that is written fairly true to the books.  Mr. Taylor doesn't seem comfortable wearing a firearm though; he's always resting his hand on the butt of his pistol, kind of a rookie move for an ex-Marine and long time peace officer.  Not sure looking like you're about to \"pull\" on everyone you talk to is a good strategy.  Katee Sackhoff has been critiqued by others in her role as under sheriff \"Vic\" Moretti but mostly for being blonde instead of brunette.  Hair color aside my problem with her is she's just not obnoxious enough as she should be, more of a \"Vic-Lite\".  The biggest problem with the cast is the critical person of \"The Cheyenne Nation\" (as Walt calls him in the novels), Henry Standing Bear.  In the books Henry is a large man and an imposing physical presence and Lou Diamond Phillips, while a fine actor, lacks the sheer physicality to pull this off.For the readers familiar with the Longmire tales one of the more disorienting features of Season 1 is they start off each episode with almost exact recreation of the crime from one of Craig Johnson's books.  Naturally you think, \"oh, I know where this is heading\" but actually you don't as the screen writers then abandon Johnson's work and concoct a totally different set of circumstances.  It would be OK if the alternative solution was as good as the original but it never is.Other problems pertain to marginalizing important characters like Ruby, Walt's office manager or overemphasizing others like daughter Cady who's supposed to be living in Philly and not working in town and dating Walt's deputy who's challenging him for sheriff in the next election.  \"Longmire\" is hardly the worst thing on television but for fans of the original it's far from rewarding to watch."
B008947J8U I lived in Wyoming for six years and the locations picked pass easily for prairies in the high plains. The stories are believable in a long range way, but not in the months leading up to an election. Still,  the series has kept my interest and I can't wait for next season."
B008947J8U Saw this with no real expectations and have been very happy with this series.  Every episode has been interesting with continual character development"
B008947J8U Totally enjoyed. I like the slow evolution of the back story ...the characters have depth and believability. The storylines were interesting and the setting great."
B008947J8U A mix between old west law and modern times, very well played out and the acting completely makes the chemistry"
B008947J8U Really enjoyed this and am looking forward to seeing where they take it in season 2. I love the setting and cinematography. There'sa sort of &#34;cleanliness&#34; and clarity about it that really grabbed me."
B008947J8U we so enjoyed the first season of Longmire on TV, that I had to order it, for watching without COMMERCIALS, what a delight!!Can't wait for the second season to come out."
B008947J8U Longmire is an awesome show because it has an interseting cast and Sheriff Longmire always knows how to solve crimes an catch th bad guys."
B008947J8U \"Longmire\" is already well into its second season on A&E;, but it's not too late to catch up on Season One, available on DVD.  The show follows the compelling adventures of Walt Longmire, the grizzled Sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming.  As the series opens, Walt has just come back to full-time work after a lost year mourning the death of his wife.  And there is plenty of work to do.  In ten well-executed episodes, Longmire will battle killers, drug-runners, sex offenders, revenge-seekers, and corrupt politicians, while walking a difficult law enforcement line between the Feds and the local Cheyenne reservation police.The show offers plenty of sub-plots.  Walt has difficulties with his daughter, a local attorney with a big secret.  Walt's contentious deputy Branch Connally is running for Walt's job as sheriff.  New deputy Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti is a tough-minded former Philly homicide detective with a troubled marriage.  Junior deputy Ferg Ferguson seems to have no business being a deputy in the first place.  Walt and best friend Henry Standing Bear share a secret about the death of Walt's wife, an incident in Denver for which the audience gets an occasional clue and Walt gets a visit from a Denver FBI agent.  Walt himself is overdue to get over his wife's death and move on in his personal life.This is an entertaining series.  The producers take full advantage of their western setting.  The characters are fully developed, interesting human beings with real problems.  The plots are challenging and meant to be solved by old-fashioned detective work.  Walt's stubbornly old-fashioned values and ways of doing business are a key element of the stories.  Highly recommended."
B008947J8U This truly is a great Western.  Walt, the widowed sheriff, runs a quiet town, a believable town.  Henry, his closest friend, runs a bar.  Together they make up the yin and yang of their county.  Familiar faces often show up but this series is far from stale."
B008947J8U In today's frazzled, frenzied world Sheriff Walt Longmire slows his roll. He takes his time. His bailiwick lies under the open skies of Absaroka, Wyoming. Adapting author Craig Johnson's Western mystery novels, LONGMIRE charts a more leisurely course, far removed from the hi-tech hustle and bustle of them CSI shows. It celebrates the stillness of a man, the grace of listening and of paying attention. Walt Longmire is very much a product of his environs, patient and a man of few words and keenly observant. But he's had a year's worth of awful, his wife dyin', his subsequent fall from grace, his descent into dark depression. At last he pulls himself up, begins again to take an interest in keeping the peace and mending fences with his attorney daughter Katie (Cassidy Freeman). And it's good timing. Murder and other sorts of unkindness have breached Absaroka.I was appalled when AMC started halfassing it as a classic film network, and now here's A&E; subverting its original mission statement. I had no idea that A&E; programming had branched out from producing biographies and prestigious British dramas. But while I condemn the network for selling out and dipping into the realm of reality shows, it keeps a sliver of its soul by broadcasting LONGMIRE, this compelling contemporary western detective series.I won't lie. Katee Sackhoff brung me here. But it's Robert Taylor's impeccable, world-weary performance that keeps me coming back. Robert Taylor looks like John Schneider's tougher, more careworn brother. His role calls for a laconic approach but also a certain soulfulness. Longmire is a broken, devastated person, still reeling from his wife's passing. This sense of loss colors everything he does. Longmire embodies that aphorism, \"Still waters run deep.\" When you least expect it, he'll break down a Latin phrase for you.The cases the sheriff's office investigates aren't the big draw, although there's fun in watching Longmire and his staff work under the constraints of limited, outdated resources (Longmire himself doesn't own a cell phone). But it's all about the examination of character and the interplay among the cast. The complex relationships keep it interesting. Before Longmire's rededication to his craft, when he was wallowing in grief, his slick, ambitious deputy, Branch Connally (Bailey Chase), decided to run against him for reelection. Deputy Connally smirks: \"Given the choice between some fresh thinkin' and a tired absentee sheriff drivin' around with empty beer cans all over the floor of his truck, I like my odds.\" It makes for good water cooler talk, having a smug snake in the grass.I love Katee Sackhoff's take on whatever role she's playing. She always puts her own distinctive spin on it. You can't take your eyes off her, not only because she's very easy on the eyes, but because she's always doing something interesting when she acts, a look, a mannerism, that big smile. Her Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti - former Philly homicide detective, now six months in as sheriff's deputy in Absaroka - is a sexy, take-no-crap sort of woman who is endlessly loyal to Longmire. And so what if maybe the dress code doesn't seem to apply to her? In big, open-skied Wyoming, you're surely allowed a few buttons unbuttoned.YOUNG GUNS 2 and, don't judge me, THE POWER will always be my two favorite Lou Diamond Phillips pictures. But you can't deny that he lends tremendous depth as Henry Standing Bear, Longmire's wise and capable Cheyenne best friend. One of the show's thru arcs revolves around whatever shady skullduggery Longmire and Standing Bear got up to in Denver a year back. Standing Bear's signature flourish is that he talks like he's got a grudge against contractions. Meanwhile, Adam Bartley as \"The Ferg\" Ferguson, a well-meaning but bumbling sheriff's deputy whom Walt hired to do a solid for Ferg's pops, serves as the Enos Strate of the series. The Ferg provides laughs and earnestness and a big heart. Okay, I realize I'd just gone three paragraphs breaking down the cast, but they mean that much to the show.Stetsons and jeans and guzzling Rainier beer and navigating a beat-up Ford Bronco, that's how it's done in Absaroka if you've got the big badge. The series opens just as Walt Longmire reckons it's time he gets back in the mix: mend some fences, solve some crimes, maybe take down his ambitious deputy a peg or three. Is Longmire an old relic? Or does he still have game? He's grown odd. He compulsively picks up litter. He keeps his wife's ashes in a tea box in the kitchen. Can he keep the peace, never mind his office's infighting and the surge in murders and that the Cheyenne reservation's territorial tribal police often gets in the way? Set in a rugged, unspoiled landscape, where man and nature commune, is he the lawman to take on murderous Mennonites and mobile brothels and fearsome dog soldiers? And just what the he11 happened in Denver? Mister, you just got to tune in.LONGMIRE - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON has its ten episodes on two discs. The bonus stuff consist of two featurettes:- \"The Camera's Eye: Realizing the World of Longmire - Set against the backdrop of the West, the world of the cowboy detective is revealed\" (00:18:53 minutes)- \"Longmire Justice: Exploring the Cowboy Detective - We see how the American tradition of the cowboy and the detective genre blend so well together\" (00:28:57 minutes)"
B008947J8U Finally, a character who is real, genuine, and two generations can relate to. This poor fellow has his share of monkeys on his back, or in his closet, whatever. Makes the series very interesting. Robert Taylor is new to me, but I now find myself hooked on the series."
B008947J8U Longmire, The First Season, is a solid series. Well acted and written, fantastic camera workcombined with interesting character studies. Each episode has it's own uniqueness, while maintaininga consistent theme. Well done!"
B008947J8U Longmire was reccommended to us by a friend. It started out pretty slow, and I was skeptical about the acting, but it has really picked up the last of the 1st season. Some actors you will recognize. You should definately give it a try."
B008947J8U I really didn't enjoy this show much.  The scenery is beautiful, but the first episode pretty much scared me off of this show.  I would think they had fact-checkers or editors for some of the plot points, but they were missing in action."
B008947J8U The scenery and that the actors match it (Lou Diamond Philips is a great choice) make this nice to watch.  Good acting all around but the story line is typically rushed like any other weekly murder-mystery type police drama.  In this first episode we are informed that the Sheriff hasn't had to inform the next of kin of a death in a long time, as one would expect in such a rural setting.  But when I look at the upcoming episodes, there is a murder EVERY WEEK!  According to the storyline, the Sheriff has been in a funk for a whole year since his wife died.  His favorite deputy, the blond woman, even complains about how it's so boring compared to Philadelphia where she is from.  But suddenly, as soon as the TV Show begins following their lives, it's murder after murder after murder!  Plus prostitutes, drug cartels, and everything else!  Which is so contrived and preposterous.  I can only assume that the exponential increase in crimes and murder in this county MUST somehow be related to the tv show.I paid for the pilot episode hoping for a single story line that might run through the duration of the show.  But it appears that every week there will be a great mystery murder to solve that only the sheriff is skilled enough to solve - - and he WILL solve it by the end of that episode; and we will probably not see any of that episode's primary characters ever again (like the 16 year old girl that was a prostitute, her mother, or the murder victim's wife, or the good old boys that reported the dead sheep, etc. ).  This kind of stuff gets very boring to me.  Another formula show, like Columbo, but instead of a trench coat, old car, and the city, it's a cowboy hat, old truck, and the prairie.  I guess I'll reluctantly pass on the rest of the episodes for this reason.  If you like those kinds of shows, the murder-of-the-week crime solver types, and you like westerns, then you should be very satisfied with Longmire."
B008947J8U We love this series, we waited for Longmire to come out and weren't disappointed when we got it.  Now we are waiting for season 2."
B008947J8U Saw this show by chance, became hooked, and started following it more closely. It has an excellant cast and the views are beautiful. The action thrilling, and just a pinch of drama for flair. Well done!!"
B008947J8U I got the first season of Longmire without knowing anything about it but for information on Amazon along with some reviews. I soon became so absorbed in the series that I searched further and found that Season 2 episodes are already available on Amazon for PC. I have now finished those and will buy the DVD set as soon as it is released. That should say something about how much I enjoy the series.This series has a point of view which is that there is right and wrong and good and evil-and that we have an obligation to try to discern the right thing and to do it even under difficult circumstances. That alone sets it apart from our prevailing \"if it feels good do it\" culture.The law enforcement team, including sheriff Longmire, his three deputies and his bar owner friend, Henry,are complex and realistic. I Particularly like the interplay between the sheriff and Deputy Connelly. Connelly respects his boss but is eager to compete with him and take his place. The older man's strength, experience, and pride as he attempts to control his supremely ambitious but intelligent deputy are truly absorbing. Against this backdrop the team works around personal issues to solve crimes in modern Wyoming-including the political complexity of relations with the Indian tribes and illegal aliens.I don't want to describe individual episodes in order to preserve full enjoyment for the viewer.The first season started off a little slow as the writers introduced the main characters. The episodes became steadily more complex and absorbing as the essentials of the series were established.The modern western has never been done so well."
B008947J8U Really love this show --- simple, easy, love the scenery --- and the shows aren't all about another murder some are simple issues of a more rural sheriff ---"
B008947J8U I am old enough to remember the early western series, and this is by far as great. You have the modern technology with the rugged western flavor and it all blends in to be the greatest show on TV. I hope the writers don't spoil it by making the story line to traumatic for the lead characters. I love it and hope it goes on for a long, long time."
B008947J8U If you like Big Sky Country and mysteries, this series seems like a perfect marriage of the two.  It is worth watching for the scenery and rustic interiors alone.  Based on a popular mystery series by Craig Johnson, the sheriff, Walt Longmire, is skillfully played as an independent, compassionate but tough lawman who is recovering from the death of his wife.  Australian actor Robert Taylor plays this role but leaves his accent down under.  At first he seemed nondescript to me.  Couldn't pick him out in a line-up, but his magnetism grows on you.  He has got an abrasive and occasionally annoying female deputy, Vic, whose impulsive energy is the perfect foil for his understated demeanor.This episode involved finding the identity of the murderer of a young man whose body was found out in the wilds.  Did a hunter make a mistake or is there more behind it than that?  Longmire has to work with local Native Americans to solve the mystery.  Lou Diamond Phillips plays an earthy and warm saloon owner who is a confidant and friend of Longmire's.I found the plot in this episode a trifle complex as you are trying to figure out the backstory of the characters, how they fit in and are related to each other. It may have been first episode novelty that will settle down.  The series shows great potential.  Series that are based on novels seems to have more depth of detail and nuances.  Look forward to seeing future episodes.  I think this is going to be a popular series as it has the essentials: likable detective, inspired casting, gorgeous setting, rustic western decor, complex plots and characters, and interesting dialogue."
B008947J8U Being a huge fan of Craig Johnson's series about Walt Longmire, I am so happy to be able to add the TV series to my video library.  Here's to a long, long run!  Will be telling my friends about this program.Maggie"
B008947J8U This was an enjoyable series.  I like the character and thought the stories were interesting. My only thought was the shows moved along slowly."
B008947J8U We watched the pilot, it was okay...enough to make us curious about a second episode.  So we started the second episode and about 10 minutes in while they are investigating a crime involving a stripper they go into the strip club and then the dealbreaker for us was when the female deputy gets up on stage in full uniform and starts dancing around the stripper pole, undressing and down on her knees to supposedly get information out of the male patrons.  It was so lame and once a show has to objectify their female professional lead in such an unrealistic way...we are out.  It means lazy writing and that they are targeting an audience that we don't belong to."
B008947J8U Walt Longmire is a &#34;Man's Man&#34; and does things his way. I love this character driven show and all the characters are GREAT!"
B008947J8U Excellent portrayal of an aging lawman struggling with modern society and younger competition. Well written, and for the most part well acted."
B008947J8U Wonderful series, found it by accident, after seeing an advertisement for season 2. Had read As the Crow Flies in my reading group and really enjoy the book  So decided to start watching this series and fell in love with the very first episode.  Wonderful set of characters.  Enjoying every episode"
B008947J8U I was on this edge with this one. Main character mumbles a lot and hard to understand. This particular episode is Hollywood standard \"white man bad - Native American good\"  tripe. Tiring. Another episode they let a bear go after it killed a guy. More Hollywood fantasy. A fed bear is dead bear unfortunately, no matter how nice it is. Improbable. I'm Sorry I paid for it."
B008947J8U there is a good balance for much drama and they do not disappoint .  I found I like this show more than I may have intended when I purchased it.  I'm a fan now."
B008947J8U I am late to the series, Longmire, as it has just started it's third season. Having run out of good TV on most nights, I reverted to Netflix and discovered Longmire. Watching one episode, and I knew I had found another series to follow. I have viewed the first season, and though I find the series slow moving it sticks with me. And, the reason is, of course, the writing and the characters.The series follows Sheriff Walt Longmire of Wyoming's Absaroka County, big country with tall fur trees, snow and plains you can see from here to Monday. Longmire, it seems is returning to work after his wife's death. Longmire is an intelligent, likable fellow, who knows his job, but has been blindsided by his wife's death. Longmire is played by Robert Taylor, an Australian actor. He has a small staff, a new deputy, Vic, a pretty blonde, brought to Wyoming from Philadelphia, to follow her husband's job. Another deputy, Branch Connally, is a know it all SOB, who is working behind Longmire's back to run for Sherriff. Branch is a lazy man, looking for the easy way, and, not fit to be Sherriff. There is another deputy who doesn't seem to know much, but he tries hard. An office manager, Dorothy, runs the place and keeps it from falling apart.Longmire's old friend, Henry, played by Lou Diamond Phillips, who runs the local bar, 'Red Pony', is essential in telling him the truth, and he runs interference with the local Indian Reservation. At one time Longmire jailed the Chief of the Reservation, and there is no love for Longmire within the Indian group. Longmire's daughter, Cady, is a lawyer in a local firm. She and Henry have kept Longmire from falling completely apart during the last year.In each episode some sort of crime, usually a murder occurs. Longmire in his wisdom never jumps to conclusions, always looks at the facts, and often is on the side of the underdog. Something his deputy, Branch, always fails to do, and he falls on his face. The characters and the writing set this series apart. Plus the big country is so beautiful, even though I read filming takes place in New Mexico and Nevada. It is the wide open spaces that gives pause to the sparse talking Sherriff. He means what he says, and he talks only when he really needs to. In one episode, Longmire travels five hours to tell a wife her husband is dead. In the telling, falls apart. His wife's death is always near the surface.I understand the long awaited election is to take place soon, and like some in Chicago, I vote for longmire even though I do not live in Wyomng.Recommended. prisrob 08-05-03"
B008947J8U This follows the characters from Mr Johnson's book closely. Vic could do a bit more foul mouthed comments. Other than that, it's good."
B008947J8U This is my favorite new show - along with Justified, Chicago Fire, and Revolution. I'm a simple Iowa boy so I can relate to the country and Longmire."
B008947J8U Great Series, This is a great series, believable if you drink enough or smoke enough before watching.  Still what else am I doing except watchin the whole season, it's fun."
B008947J8U The Longmire television series is based on the Longmire book series.The stories unfold naturally, and the crime solving has an interesting process and no special effects or CSI, All of the actors are great, seasoned professions, and it shows, I watched one show and I was hooked, I downloaded the rest.This is quality television, no filler."
B008947J8U This is a great series. It is safe for children to watch. I love the characters. The story lines are solid and believable. All in all, I highly recommend this show."
B008947J8U A very interesting concept done by the 2nd actor we're aware of with the name Robert Taylor.  We loved the first actor with this name & this one does not disappoint."
B008947J8U I discovered the first book as a Kindle Daily Deal and quickly became enthralled. I knew there was supposed to be a series coming, checked and found it here. I watched all 4 of the first ones over the weekend and found them enjoyable. (I appreciated the opportunity to sign up for all as they become available, paying along the way. This way I don't have to keep checking to see if there are new ones to watch.) I'll continue to work my way through the books, though, and treasure every minute reading his exceptional writing. If you have to choose, pick the books. They last longer and are exceptional compared to enjoyable."
B008947J8U I like this show, it's interesting & you can really relate to the characters even though their individual histories are still continually unfolding.  If you like shows like Justified, Hell on Wheels then I think you would like this show."
B008947J8U My wife and I have a hard time waiting for the next episode to come out. The character development is written nicely into the story of each episode."
B008947J8U After reading many reviews by customers of Longmire Season 1, I decided to try it out.  It was a hilt with me and I will in all likehood purchase other seasons."
B008947J8U Great series which I wish was one for a longer duration per season.  I want to read the books because the series is so intriguing. Cant wait to buy the next season."
B008947J8U It's refreshing to see a crime/police drama on TV that's not based in any of the big cities. I loved Law & Order, but it is nice to see a show based somewhere less well known (Wyoming). The acting is great and the tone of the show is not comical or goofy like so many other crime dramas (Bones, NCIS, CSI)."
B008947J8U Great cast. Very enjoyable. Some of the interactions of the individuals are Hollywood style, not Wyoming style. But  go
B008947J8U I absolutely LOVE the whole Longmire series!  Excellent entertainment...characters you want to know and can identify with.  Keep them coming!"
B00899EO9M It's all about Barry! He makes the show worth watching. He adds color to every episode. Dave is a dufus."
B00899EO9M Nice for Family and you also can learn from this. I rated a four due to unappropriate language..other than that ok"
B00899EO9M This show is HILLARIOUS, it may or may not be real, but it is a great show to watch for a good laugh, as are most of the reallity shows on today and the last few years."
B00899EO9M Still entertaining after all the time it's been on television. I missed quite a few episodes and this is a good way to catch up."
B00899EO9M I simply love this show and it's characters. It's way too bad that Hester dropped out of the show.  He added quite a bit to the entertainment value."
B00899EO9M Great show, love the way they feed off each other. and the dynamics of the show. would what again more seasons please"
B00899EO9M I am wondering does the film crew set up the storage lockers and put interesting finds in them to entertain the audience? Is the conflict between buyers manufactured? If I bought a locker would there be such great stuff in them, I doubt it. And once you buy stuff you need to sell it, putting a value on an item is not what an item really sells for, right. I still enjoy watching it just to be entertained."
B00899EO9M It is a very entertaining show.  I enjoy watching as Dave bids these people up, it makes me wonder why it is more important to them to beat Dave than not spend to much money."
B00899EO9M I like this show. It's another reality based show that makes me cheer for some of the bidders and boo the others. It also shows that your can either find trash or cash in unwanted storage lockers."
B00899EO9M just did not hold my interest for very long.it is more of selling stuff than storage issues involved for most part"
B00899EO9M After watching Storage Wars: Texas, it's refreshing to watch the old gang.  Especially love Yup! and Barry.  Too much fun!"
B00899EO9M I enjoyed this season of Storage Wars (as I do each season) because of the dynamics between the bidders.  I especially enjoy Barry and his many modes of transportation ... as well as his droll sense of humor!  The rest of the cast is engaging and it's interesting to watch as they attempt to psyche each other on bids.  Dave Hester annoys me when he 'yuuuuups' at the last second.  Grrrr.  But, it wouldn't be the same without him!  Thanks for making this show available!"
B00899EO9M the show makes me want to downsize. Too much stuff in the world. At least all the junk people save. so watch it and learn"
B00899EO9M I love this show. It's just great entertainment. It's one of those few shows that you can just kick back and feel entertained. But I also love all the cool facts and stuff that you learnwhen they are having pieces appraised.I like the newer shows that have more people there bidding.it just adds more excitement!"
B00899EO9M I liked all the people this season, Jarrod and Brandi are stepping up their game. Barry is still being as funny as ever. I will look forward to watching Season 4."
B00899EO9M Still good even though they say it faked now i still like it just to see what weird stuff they put in there or find"
B00899EO9M I'm always waiting to find out what treasures will be in those lockers.  Some great surprises and the bidders grow on you."
B00899EO9M this show is like watching someone play cards, roll dice, or some other form of gamblingwith the bluffing, and each person hoping to guess, and hit the jackpot when they win thebidding war and see if they get some valuable contents. I certainly think it is over pricedand will wait for the reruns on tv."
B00899EO9M If you know this is all staged and just get a kick out of seeing old things and the thrill of thinking what if.  This is the show for you.  It is fun and the staging hokey.  But hey that is what entertainment is all about.  Jump in and give it a try it is worth a few min just to let your brain relax"
B00899EO9M love the set up in the show and the cast of carrecters, specially the old guy with the cool cars and Dave Hester,, YUUUUUP!keep it coming but I am not pay 1.99 for anything so my show is over.Thanks, Eddie"
B00899EO9M Completely unreal.  I can't see anyone leaving some of the things they come up with.  No one leaves rare coins and valuable artwork."
B00899EO9M Even though we all know these &#34;reality&#34; shows are scripted, they're a lot of fun to watch and Storage Wars Season 3 is no exception.  My wife and I especially like Barry and his crazy antics."
B00899EO9M Fun but sometimes predicable.  I'm uncertain how &#34;unscripted&#34; the show is. I mostly watch to see Barry Weiss in action."
B00899EO9M Barry is a hoot!  He really makes the show.  The other characters blend the total scheme of this comedy show"
B00899EO9M Because I love the show along with the characters Brandy being sexy and smart and Jerod the witty one of course Caintleave My man Barry out with all his poker faces and Darrel &brandon the bad asses they are I could do without Dave being the ass he is"
B00899EO9M Storage wars has been fun and interesting to watch but I'm afraid that by season 3 it's starting to show it's age. More time is spent on trying to cast the characters into something entertaining and less on what they find in the storage units."
B00899EO9M Season 3 of Storage Wars was yet another hit. If you like season 1 and 2, then you won't be disappointed with Season 3 as everything stays the same: characters, show's format, and of course the hard fast bids! The only things that is different is the storage lockers.The only thing I wish this show would do more of, which I think would make the show even better is have more characters on there. They need to have new characters or bring back some old ones. The regular cast is fine, but gets old. There is only one new character on the show this season, Jeff Jarrod. He got to be in 3 shows, but he quickly disappeared after that.If you love storage wars, then this season is a must see!"
B00899EO9M Going back and looking at this again, it is true..what is one mans junk is another man's treasure...all  the drama  fit to  open the storage lockers have mini meltdown with  he bidding wars..see the goodies  or not...and then watch the appraisels. cool concept. I have liked the show since the beginning,  great characters...Barry is  still  awesome!  I  always thought  Dave a was  cool...right up until this season  he yuppped himslef off the show  and became a victim  of his own success/ ego.  Characters are  cool... you can see how daryl  is just daryl.. he knows a lot about  bait and tackle and  some other thigns but  maybe  he feel in the ocean one too many times:) Brandy  sports a tattoo as well  when they go  for the ship locker...youza :)  In all  this season is probally the best. If offers a lot and you can see how the production value rose  with  some minor  plot lines  around  each  character. Barry in particular cracks me up  with  the people he knows and the  vehichles  he drives in.  BTW congrats to  his daughter you  put on a fantastic wedding...according to  your mom  and sister.  Darryl's big score at the end was  awesome, who  would have known that chicano art  was  worth  that much.  very cool. Production value for this in HD is good,  good crisp use of light and the night  stuff worked out.  You can tell though  that  they  tape over the  Home depot  and Lowe's names  to not give them any  promotion,  that tells me  that  they go in and stage it a bit before they open them,  and some stuff seems too good  to be true, but that's why I watch.  It  is like a mini treasue chest  with a bidding war that drives people crazy.  Have they jumped the shark? No..but  they are close I believe."
B00899EO9M Antique Roadshow, American Pickers, Pawn Stars ... it's cool to see other people's junk.  You don't have to drive to garage sales or get dirty!  Is it scripted?  The personality clashes are overdone, but sometimes it's funny."
B00899EO9M Just more of the same.  It would be interesting for them to introduce some new players.  The rumor has it that the good stuff is planted - I wonder if that is true."
B00899EOIS My wife and sister love this show. Apparently its quite popular. I am more a fan of action, a venture and sience fiction myself so have never watched it."
B00899EOIS I'm hooked on PLL (as on many other shows as a show junkie;pp) And I love Amazon for having most of the new ones out there so I can watch them on the go (KINDLE FIRE)Pretty Little Liars season 3 is as good as 1&2. The Amazon quality is great as well:)"
B00899EOIS I love Pretty Little Liars. Is one of the shows that you can't get enough of. This season is a little bit more about the feelings and every-day situations of the characters instead of A (like in seasons one and two), so here you get to see more about how the characters feel with their personal issues, but at the same time the A mystery that never stops.This season is full of twists, mysteries and crazy moments, and I think Pretty Little Liars is getting better and better in each season, it pushes everything a little bit more as the show grows. If you're a fan of the show, don't doubt on buying it! You'll get addicted episode by episode."
B00899EOIS I love this tv series. :D It's great especially when your prego and on bed rest. Helped pass the time."
B00899EOIS I had not seen any of Pretty Little Liars on TV. I started watching it on Netflix where I saw Season 1 and 2 but they didn't have Season 3. I was interested enough to purchase Season 3 from Amazon.  When I first started watching Season 1, I quickly came to the conclusion that the title of show is misleading. I suppose it is a way to get attention so viewers will watch the program. The four main characters are high schools friends who had a friend who was murdered. The friends weren't involved in the murder but their murdered friend had commit a crime with tragic consequences and the girls were afraid of being accused of their deceased friend's actions. They become paranoid and then rightly worried when they begin receiving notes and text messages signed &#34;A&#34; the first initial of their murdered friend's name. While the girls deal with these alarming messages, their lives continue with all the drama of being a pretty teenager: boyfriends, peer pressure and issues with their parents."
B00899EOIS great show... its really neat watching the story unfold... twist after twist... shock after shock!!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
B00899EOIS This show is amazing.  There is always a cliff hanger, and keeps your continually guessing what will happen next.  Definitely recommend this show!"
B00899EOIS I will not buy this on amazon instant because they are charging too much. I mean I cant even download this unless I dishout more money for a freaking kindle fire! It is stupid to pay so much for a show I could lose if amazon goes under. Sorry but amazon you lost my purchase. I bought one episode and just couldnt bring myself to buy the rest of the season."
B00899EOIS Great delivery time on this item! Could not wait to get it tarted to watch where i left off from last season.Plot thickens and new villains are finally revealed!! I love the characters and the new developments!"
B00899EOIS I have been watching this show on Netflix from the First Season through the Second Season. I am so &#34;hook&#34; up that I had to watch the episodes from the Third Season. I really enjoyed this show."
B00899EOIS The suspense continues in season three!  Even though A was unmasked at the end of season two, strange things continue to happen . . . suggesting that the evil stalking continues.This season introduces some interesting new mysteries and fascinating new characters.  This show does a great job of keeping the audience guessing, introducing new questions even as old ones are answered."
B00899EOIS How can you reach the end of last season and think the next could hold any new surprises?  It does."
B00899EOIS This is a good show, but the storyline is getting a little stale.  I would love to see the story expanded."
B00899EOIS I know this is adapted from the books but please move at a quicker pace than what they're moving at.  It seems like each season nothing gets accomplished.  I ended up giving up on this series because it was just too boring."
B00899EOIS The Four pretty ladies are once again fight and turning to discover who the person ---A---is. There's more suspence more nerve racking stories and something new at every turn."
B00899EOIS Pretty Little Liars is so addictive and has been from the first show.  This season has revealed much and also brought up many more questions.  We are looking forward to the new Spinoff starting in January."
B00899EOIS I didn't think I would like this show at first, but I've really gotten into the story. I like how much they've done with the story and how it's not easily predictable. They don't figure out all the details right away about who's blackmailing them."
B00899EOIS I missed the tv series as I worked in the evenings.  I purchased it as it was good and exciting."
B00899EOIS I had my doubts at first but this show sucks you in and keeps you watching. Good mystery/drama series. I have to say it is now a favorite!"
B00899EOIS I ordered this series because I would keep forgetting what night it was on TV or which channel it came on and I would miss it. So I watch them on the weekends instead. I am a older woman and thought this might be to young and I would not be interested in it but I am hooked on Pretty Little Liars. It has so many twists and turns in it. Just when you think you have it figured out something different changes your mind. Love it!!!!"
B00899EOIS This show is addicting! Can't wait for each new episode! Very suspenseful and good acting by whole cast. Love it"
B00899EOIS I have watched the show from the start and all the actors and plot is great. Looking forward to watching the new series only after it is free for Primetime members."
B0089A6BLU I love Teen Wolf. The show is so addicting, so well written and so well acted, and season 2 is not the exception. Season 2 makes this show grow so much in a good way, there's so much to see and only 12 episodes. This is my favorite Teen Wolf season so far, because it introduces us to some beloved characters (Erica, Boyd, Isaac), and you never know what's next. The things that happen to the characters makes a great balance between being a teenager, but also dealing with supernatural issues in such a natural way. Nothing feels forced. Every episode is awesome and you get hooked even more with season one. Some episodes have a \"moments after\" continuity, something I love about shows, and the jokes, the horror, the kick-ass fights, the chemistry, the love... everything is still there, but bigger and better.This season digs much deeper about werewolves than any other recent movie or show (since vampires have taken all the spotlight), and there's a lot of mythology, plot twists and the episodes keep you at the edge of your seat.In my opinion this is the best TW season yet! (Currently watching season 3)."
B0089A6BLU One of the best television series out there.  action pack from beginning to end and simply a great delight for those who love paranormal were wolf books and movies."
B0089A6BLU Such a guilty pleasure but a fantastic show! They've got good writers, a great cast and I keep coming back for more. I swear it's not as cheesy as the name makes it out to be. If you're into supernatural stories you should absolutely check out this show."
B0089A6BLU This series has been a pleasant surprise on AP.  Glad I looked into it.  I they are doing a good job of mixing humor/Great effects/ and action.  Some characters can get a bit stale but ... the coach grows on you, slowly.Third season...ramps up the tension.  Goes a bit darker."
B0089A6BLU One of the great shows to watch.  Acting is tops to me and the action is always there each episode.  Am hooked to the point not watching just one or 2 shows a day is good enough I get lost watching on line and can watch several hours at night.  I would recommend this for older teens not younger ones as it does have some graphic bloody parts."
B0089A6BLU If you like Buffy, Grimm, Supernatural, you'll like this.  It's got all the teen angst, learning to trust friends, your own instincts, yada yada of Buffy.  It's monsters connect to real mythology like Grimm, and it's got the hot male eye candy like Supernatural."
B0089A6BLU Awesome series- I don't know how they can make a series funny and scary at the same time. This show does this perfectly by blending drama, comedy and gore all in one."
B0089A6BLU The world has changed for Scott and his group of friends after defeating the werewolf that had set out to destroy them. As the new Alpha, Derek begins recruiting discarded teens in to his own wolf pack in preparation for the battle to come with the Argents. Meanwhile, Scott and Allison are ripped apart as her grandfather returns to avenge the death of his daughter. But now, a terrifying new creature has arrived that will threaten to destroy them all...MTV's hit series returns in Teen Wolf: Season 2! While it is easy to dismiss the show at first glance, Teen Wolf is quick to prove that this is no TWILIGHT. Russell Mulcahy and his team of writers and directors have delivered on the Horror in a slickly produced and surprisingly entertaining series that is filled with fast-paced action, unexpected twists, and steamy romance. The creature design and skilled make-up work that are used to bring the deadly Kanima to life are top of the line, as the series continues to root itself in practical effects whenever possible.Season 2 introduces a number of key players into the unfolding drama between the two clans, particularly in the scheming patriarch of the Argent family: Gerard. Michael Hogan plays the part perfectly as the keen manipulator who will stop at nothing to see Scott, Derek, and the rest of the pack destroyed. His part in luring Allison in to the family business is essential, to say the least. Crystal Reed gives an added depth to her character this season as she is transformed from the swooning teenager in to a hardened warrior. Unfortunately, we see very little growth in many of the other male leads, who seem to be caught in an emotionless void as they are drawn in to the same stereotypical lines of action and reaction episode after episode. Whether it is was intended this way or not, Tyler Posey comes off as a rather dopey hero, as Scott is frequently looked down upon for h
B0089A6BLU Every time I think they cannot top an episode-they do! The cast is wonderful and well chosen for each part they play.  Makes me look forward to Mondays."
B0089A6BLU Love this show, always something or someone new to add new interest-doesn't really need it, as is pretty interesting as it is.What I don't like, is that we have Amazon Prime, and all the seasons were free-up to this point-we want to watch the 302 which is right after the season three, and they want $1.99 per episode!  Doesn't this defeat the purpose of paying for the \"Prime\"?!Amazon-change this!Thank you Amazon!They have now included part two of season three!  :-)Looking forward to season four!"
B0089A6BLU My wife and I have sat here and watched every possible episode! We can not believe it! After all, we are of the age of the original Teen Wolf and Teen Wolf 2 movies!Who cares....great show...just don't tell our kids!"
B0089A6BLU This season of Teen Wolf has twists and turns that I never expected. It's funny, sexy, and exciting all wrapped up into one. Definitely  a must see for those that Liked Teen Wolf season one or for anyone looking for a great werewolf show out there."
B0089A6BLU First of all (with due respect to the characters): This is a work of FICTION (and 22-23 year olds are playing the part of 16 year olds)!! It was never intended to be Shakespeare. It is very possible that the first season took everyone by surprise by its success and the idea for a second season was not necessarily fully crystalized. It is, after all, on MTV and not TNT or USA. That said, the show did a superb job taking things in a new direction and avoided the triteness of trying to imitate what one might see on HBO, \"Vampire Diaries\", or \"Twilight\". The special effects alone deserve kudos and the cast is uniformly strong and varied. We are treated to:1)A \"murder\" mystery;2)Suspense;3)Surprises;4)Cliff hangers;and 5)3-Dimensional characters, among other things. The show has been so successful that it has been picked up for a third season and moved to LA from Georgia which is certainly a step up and a vote of confidence (look how fast the 2nd season DVD is being offered compared to its predecessor). Now for the criticism voiced above:1)The show is designed for a youthful audience and the attractiveness of the cast is undoubtedly deliberate; it is called \"eye candy\" and the lack of shirts and other nudity is exactly what one would expect. You don't want your cast to look like werewolves even when they're not; 2)Lydia remains a partial mystery as does the \"veterinarian\" and his \"daughter?\" which is what one looks forward to; 3)The Argents were evidently a prominent family in the city. Thus the turnout for Kate's funeral (and you can't expect to see a funeral for every character killed - then we would be watching nothing but funerals);4)The death of the Omega showed us the broadsword that Grandpa Argent can wield and which appears later on in a threatening moment to one of the more prominent characters; 5)As already pointed out, Derek is not much of an Alpha; 6)By resurrecting Peter, it explains why Scott did not die when Peter supposedly did since P was the one who turned S and, according to Werewolf lore, S should have died as well;7)There may have been some \"loose ends\" (I could mention others but so what!)but there is a third season coming and there are always loose ends to deal with in episodic TV. This is a FUN show which doesn't pull its punches. Moments of comedy are sprinkled in with the major dramatic thrust.Will the werewolves survive? Will the hunters prevail? Will Scott resolve his romantic situation? Will Grandpa Argent return and in what form? What is in store for Jackson? Is there another Kanima on the horizon? Is the veterinarian a competing hunter with a soft spot for certain werewolves? Is Matt really dead? What will Lydia become? What does Peter intend? What path will Stiles be taking? Stay tuned!! Enough said."
B0089A6BLU Teen Wolf season two is great. It set the real tone of the show. Young and old alike. This year it shows more of family, which is great. I will always watch this show."
B0089A6BLU I love this teen wolf series, Its just great action,love, and just exciting, if you like werewolfs and other weird things then get these"
B0089A6BLU This series continues to get better and better. The writing and acting are much better than you would expect from anything produced on/for the MTV network. The story is interwoven and passed from season 1 to season 2 effortlessly and the cast is hot hot hot. All together, you have a formula for a real success."
B0089A6BLU Actually a super creative offering. I quite enjoyed it. I did have to suspend disbelief more than once, like a 17 year old girl being able to hold her own with a werewolf? Really? And wow, a lot of murders, so many it was like water off a duck's back, as well as the werewolves being the least bloodthirsty of all, compared to a number of the humans they were practically Amnesty International. That being said, I thought it had a great assortment of actors, both young and older. Stiles is of course my favorite by far, so much so I'd hazard to guess that in my assessment he is the true star of the show. But all of them, bad guys and good, are really fun to watch. So much eye candy and talented, too. I have no hesitation recommending it. Fantabulous!"
B0089A6BLU ***complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review***Teen Wolf is an exciting, supernatural series that doesn't follow the normal Hollywood Trends. I saw some growth in the characters from last season and learned more about exactly how these werewolves exist. The show plays like sort of a supernatural soap opera, which isn't an insult. I enjoy this type show once in awhile. This season, people died, people disappeared, people came back from the dead.  There are still many secrets left to be revealed. I'm really curious about the so-called vegetarian. We're left wondering about a lot of things including whether or not Matt is dead, if Grandpa Argent will return, and what Lydia is changing into. All these unanswered questions are exactly what will keep fans biting their nails until next season.Season Two of Teen Wolf took off with a growl and kept the action going to the very last episode.  While generally geared towards the younger crowd, this is a show I don't mind watching with my teenage daughter. The special effects are great, the characters are interesting (even if the actors playing them are 26 instead of 16) and the cliffhanger season finale left me wondering what Season 3 will bring. 4 Stars"
B0089A6BLU I enjoyed watching this series but upset that I can't get the lastseason without paying. Oh well there other things to watch."
B0089A6BLU The actors are interesting and the action is good. He makes werewolves look good. Waiting for more shows. Backgrounds are beautiful."
B0089A6BLU Just watch it!!  If you like Vampire Diaries and The Originals, you will DEFINITELY love this show!!! If you do like it, please email MTV and tell them to make season 4!!!"
B0089A6BLU Great series, great cast.  My daughter got me hooked on this and I really enjoy it.  Can't wait for season 4."
B0089A6BLU After the amazing conclusion to season one of Teen Wolf, we see our heroes finally at peace with the events that have happened behind them.But now, new murders have been appearing!  A new threat rises and new enemies are born!  Scott, Stiles, and Allison go up against wolf-mutant creatures!  Derek forms a pack!  And a \"certain\" old villain is back!Season two returns with new excitement, new characters, and a whole new storyline!  You will not want to miss out on this!"
B0089A6BLU Lots of great storyline, dialog, action and romance.  I hope MTV keeps this one going for some time.  The family can watch this one over and over."
B0089JDMHW i never get tired of watching this show. it getting better with story line from beginning to beauiful relationship brother...cant wait til 5th season"
B0089JDMHW Royal Pains had a bit of a rocky start this season, choosing to keep the realistic disagreement between Hank and Evan going. That is sorted out though and HankMed has reinvented itself, though not perfectly and the brothers are back on track. The writers and producers decided to bring the mysterious Boris back into the mix and the credits show him as a regular now rather than as a recurrent guest star. The machinations of Boris and his family have always been a great sub-plot on Royal Pains and I am thrilled to see more of Boris and his empire and his rich man's mystique.Boris's mystique is front and center in this episode as an intruder is shot and saved by Hank - the truth of the intruder and just when, why and how he is shot is a surprise and partially revealed by Eddie R, which will no doubt keep relations cold between Eddie and Boris.The patient of the week is a matchmaker with a heart transplant who tries to interest both Hank and Divya in her services. She ends by interesting them both, though is surprising ways. All in all a good episode that finds Royal Pains getting back on its feet."
B0089JDMHW These are the good guys, always out to help and frequently save the day with the mansions of the Hamptons as a nice backdrop."
B0089JDMHW We can pretend to experience the Hamptons while smiling at the entertaining, if implausible, medical adventures of Hank Med. Seems like residents of the Hamptons are prone to very unusual illnesses."
B0089JDMHW I love this show this was a really great episode. Usa has a real winner with this show. I wish I could see this series every week all year long."
B0089JDMHW IN FOLLOWING THIS SERIES, THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION. LOOKING FORWARD TO WATCHING  ALL THE SHOWS AND CATCHING ANY I MISSED"
B0089JDMHW a very funny and very touching show.  I like all the characters on this series Bravo!!!!!!  It is very heart warming to see them solve medical problems using items at hand"
B0089JDMHW This show, which never was more nor less than a silly drama set in a swank, sweet location, has slid off to the side.  Season 4 lacked the bite it found in earlier seasons.  But all is not lost.  Once a fan... still worth watching."
B0089JDMHW These guys are fawning all over the females and everybody they come in contact with. It's getting so sappy that it's hard to watch. I liked it better when they were stronger characters who did medical comedy and adventure. I like the guy from Spanish Prisoner, he's strong and rock solid. the boys are too whimpy and wishy washy. Pretty people everywhere."
B0089JDMHW This show's real gems are the characters, fantastic character acting,  and their dramatic developments. The plots are always slightly different and amusing, but predictable."
B0089JDMHW As with any series the longer it goes the more the characters have to develop.  This was a fairly good season for that.  Looking forward to season 5.I will include a synopsis of the stories as this season has little to offer.  There are no special features or production of videos to make this offering and achievement rather than a chore.1 &#34;After the Fireworks&#34;After multiple competitive eaters become sick, Hank and Divya treat them. Evan pursues a new business venture, and Jill has her last day at Hamptons Heritage.2 &#34;Imperfect Storm&#34;Jill's nephew is treated by Hank. Evan tries to secure a new client. Divya faces a difficult decision.3 &#34;A Guesthouse Divided&#34;Hank and Evan are pitted against each other when pursuing the same opportunity. A going-away party is thrown for Jill while Divya tries to help Hank and Evan make amends.4 &#34;Dawn of the Med&#34;Hank is hired by a young couple. Eddie returns to try to reconcile Hank and Evan. Divya's mother visits to reconnect with her.5 &#34;You Give Love a Bad Name&#34;A matchmaker is Hank and Divya's new patient while Evan attempts to get his staff back in line. Paige prepares to throw a party. Protecting his family is Boris's main priority.6 &#34;About Face&#34;HankMed treats a country club manager. Evan uses Paige's help and gets the business opportunity he's always wanted.7 &#34;Fools Russian&#34;A secret meeting in Manhattan involves Hank. An Internet entrepreneur is treated by Evan and Dr. Sacani. Divya and her father, resolve their differences.8 &#34;Manimal&#34;Hank and Divya treat a large-animal veterinarian. Evan and Paige comfort a close friend who has experienced an unexpected loss. Boris is obligated to make accommodations.9 &#34;Business and Pleasure&#34;During a stakeout at an exotic car event, Hank treats an undercover DEA agent who fears she may have been poisoned with meth.10 &#34;Who's Your Daddy?&#34;Hank's latest patient, an ailing polo team owner, refuses to stop playing. Divya is having a difficult time with her foray into the dating world. Evan worries about a family dinner meeting with Paige's parents.11 &#34;Dancing With the Devil&#34;A pop star needs HankMed's help while visiting the Hamptons on a tour. Hank meets a pediatrician and Divya falls for an Argentinian polo player.12 &#34;Hurts Like a Mother&#34;A romance novelist and her daughter become sick with what appears to be different ailments. Divya's new boyfriend seeks out Jeremiah's medical help.13 &#34;Something Fishy This Way Comes&#34;Boris asks for Hank's help for Dimitri. Evan and Paige meets a woman who claims to be Paige's biological mother.14 &#34;Sand Legs&#34;Hank realizes what his past relationships have all been about and Divya's recent romance has a surprising outcome.15/16 &#34;Off-Season Greetings&#34;  (Two Part Episode)The bachelorette and bachelor parties both end up in Las Vegas. Before Evan and Paige marry, the weather puts a few obstacles in their way along with a surprise."
B0089JDMHW After four seasons I'm still engaged and look forward to each episode. I like the &#34;evolution of Evan&#34; through the years from days of poor judgment to seasoned partner in the business. Hank is still interesting and it's been good that fewer episodes rely on a highly creative and unlikely medical solution to a rare disorder he happens to come across. I'm sure there are thousands left to explore but how plausible is it that he knows so much and happens to use it all in the Hamptons? I'm curious to see where season 5 takes us after (spoiler alert) the loss of Boris."
B0089JDMHW As usual, all the characters work well together.  Enjoy watching it alot. Mark Feuerstein makes a good linchpin for the other characters."
B0089JDMHW I catch every third or fourth episode and I like it.  I always like a good medical mystery tho' so... take that for what it is worth.  There is always some sort of drama going on as they go about their business."
B0089JDMHW I began watching Royal Pains one evening, and ended up enjoying it so much that I started purchasing it here.  It is an enjoyable series, and one I will continue to watch until the network is dumb enough to cancel it."
B0089JDMHW If you haven't been watching this show by now then you're crazy. It's like Macgyver got a Medical Degree and sold out to the filthy rich yet he's Robin Hood too treating patients on call  at home work any where any time HankMed will be there in a Flash and treat you like your Family. Then there's hanks Whackey yet well meaning brother Even who always means well but sometimes ends up causing more trouble than was there to begin with. His Physicians Assistant is a brilliant girl that is Hanks right hand woman and constantly putting Evan in his place. Just check it out cause it's good"
B0089JDMHW I have to say, I always enjoy watching this show! I hope they keep it going for a while. I think that one of the best parts about it is the involvement of people from all over the world."
B0089JDMHW I like this series very much. Placing it in The Hamptons allows for a much larger range of settings and plots than the typical medical show set in a hospital. The characters are really engaging and the actors are talented. I look forward to each episode."
B0089U12GO Very down home,Louisiana, Cajon...different in that it has no professional actors,raw police work,but I found it to try too hard to make the police work interesting...the place is depressing, looks very poverty stricken.never any beautiful scenes.after seeing this ,I would never want to visit the area.."
B0089U12GO This show holds my attention, creeps me out, and keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I really love it! Freaky stuff happens in the bayou. Can't see that kind of stuff on any other cop show.  Being a police officer down there should be considered another stamp in the man card!"
B0089U12GO My husband and I enjoy the &#34;reality documentary&#34; programs, and this is a good one.  The officers are dedicated, polite, and family-oriented.  But they are also tough.  LA is an unusual state, and this program offers a different perspective on law enforcement on the bayou."
B0089U12GO Chewing gum for the eyes.  I'm not a fan of reality shows but the novelty of one in the bayou was worth a look.  There is a little humor and some interesting cases but not enough to have drawn me in a second season."
B0089U12GO What a bunch of characters! Including the cops! This Cajun style version of &#34;COPS&#34; is both fun and interesting. The cops sure have a lot of expensive equipment that, hopefully, was funded by forfeitures from criminals and not the taxpayers."
B0089U12GO The series flows coherently. Characters are appealing.Hope to have it continue on prime soon.Thanks for showing us this season."
B0089U12GO This is a family friendly program that I find to be the best &#34;Cop&#34; show produced. It downplays violence and displays the 'Protect and Serve' side of law enforcement. Very compelling cast that smoothly entices you into every episode - 5 stars at least."
B0089U12GO The show is great.  I love the paranormal aspect with the legends of the rougarou.  It's also a scary place with all the dark voodoo."
B0089U12GO We love the genre of police vs felons! We always search for this type program but not all are that good. This one was surprisingly well done."
B0089U12GO One of those shows you can watch with the kids without worrying about someone dropping an F-bomb or something.  It doesn't necessary paint Cajun folks in the best light.  It has some very humorous moments to offset any intensity."
B0089U12GO this is all i am going to write so take it or leave it! lllllllllssssssssaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkjkkkrrrrrrrrrerrnnnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmmnmm nwhat happened to all the wholesome,oldies but goodies showes?"
B0089U12GO i  like the atmosphere of cajun country (music, sights and swampy conditions).  the story line is fast and excitings.  crocodiles you can leave out however.  good acting."
B0089U12GO It'll do better than watching reruns for the 5th time but I wasn't overly impressed with it.  Could have been much better."
B0089U12GO You can tell that a lot of the scenes are setup. But a very entertaining show. I miss living in Louisiana!"
B0089U12GO We have really enjoyed watching this program. All the things people think of to do is so funny and sometimes very intense."
B0089U12GO I enjoy shows about how different people live, whether cultural groups (as here) or professions (as in Amazon Prime's upcoming &#34;Mozart in the Jungle&#34;).  In this show, we see life in the south Louisiana countryside through the eyes of the local Sheriff's Department. For local flavor, included are 'gators and shrimp, hotheads and hardcases. Fascinating."
B0089U12GO I love how they explain what folks might be thinking or why they do what they're doing. I think it's a good show for any age or race."
B0089U12GO Cajun justice is a great TV show. I love that southern action. down to earth real life people.you'll love it too."
B0089U12GO first off just listening to them talk is amazing. they seem like the happyist people in the world. there believes in witchcraft, and all that vodoo stuf is amazing to listen to.  The police down there seem to roll with the punches. The show kind of wants you to be among the people of the bojou"
B0089U12GO I only watched two episode of this series.  It isn't a story type of show but just a lot of scattered things happening.  Someone may enjoy the shows but I would personally not recommend it to anyone."
B0089U12GO Always interested in the &#34;Cajun&#34; genre' and was not disappointed with this show.  The characters (employees) of this department were each &#34;featured&#34; rather nicely on different shows where they encounter different problems but found the antics / teasing between the officers an entertaining way to end each episode.Keep up the good work."
B008BF99F8 What a great series!  It picks up where it left off years ago.  The Ewings of the 2013.. spectacular!  I highly recommend this series to all the original Dallas fans"
B008BF99F8 Still as great as ever.  We can't wait each week to see what's going to happen next.  Great to see the original cast, along with all the new actors plan to make the world a better place ...."
B008BF99F8 JR is as ruthless as ever. Would have liked more Sue Ellen and JR scenes but it is a good show and season. Even Cliff is back. JR's son John Ross is great and hot and sexy too. If you're a Dallas fan your collection is not complete w/o it."
B008BF99F8 I did not know what to expect with this new edition of Dallas but I'm sure glad I watched. The whole season was excellent and the writers did a good job of delivering the excitement and suspense known to follow the Ewings. I definitely recommend the show's whole seasons to new and existing Dallas fans."
B008BF99F8 I own the first Dallas from the 80's and was reluctant to watch the new one because I didn't think it could be topped. I was and still am a huge fan. Thank you TNN for bringing back a classic with superb story telling, expert casting and actors. The entire team is to be commended for great television."
B008BF99F8 A great show. If you followed Dallas the new series is a must !! It is a great mix of  old, grown, and new characters!!!"
B008BF99F8 I never missed an episode of the original series, so when I heard that they were going to produce the show again, I was ecstatic. Usually, remakes or updates of TV shows are poorly done at best. Thankfully, the new Dallas series is not only as good as the original, but in some respects better. This never would have worked if Larry Hagman and many of the other original cast members weren't involved, but because they are, and combined with the talent of newcomers, it makes for a hit series.(R.I.P.) ~ Larry Martin Hagman (September 21, 1931 - November 23, 2012)"
B008BF99F8 Note: I have seen the first two episodes with XFinity On Demand in HD.Yes, you read correctly, my friends. Southfork is back in operation after 20 years, plus or minus a few television movies. Bobby, Sue Ellen and, of course, J.R., have returned for more double dealing, wheeling, backstabbing and deceiving. Joining them are John Ross Ewing III (born at the end of season 1 of the first DALLAS) and Christopher (apart from knowing that he's Bobby and Pam's adopted son, I don't know-nor do I want to know-anymore, as I plan on viewing every season of DALLAS on DVD).Let me begin with the pros.PROSBringing back the original cast...well, some of them, anyway. It would have been a real disappointment to call the show Dallas and not bring back Bobby, Sue Ellen and J.R.Bringing back the theme song, though it's also a con, and I'll explain why in a minute.A strong storyline. I personally don't think that Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and especially Larry Hagman would have agreed to appear on the show if there hadn't been a good script. It's a really involving plot, and it keeps getting thicker in a good way. Plus, you really care about the main characters, just as you did in the original series. There are more double-crosses to come...CONSBeginning with the second episode, the sexual content is amped up considerably from the original series. Back in 1978 and throughout DALLAS' fourteen season run, the sex was only implied and even then, it was handled discreetly. I can understand such a scene making its way into a show like The Borgias, when that is what actually occurred; however, to bring sex scenes into the continuation of a classic television series does a grave injustice to the first series.The classic theme song has not only been edited from its original run time of 1 minute, 13 seconds, but it has also been reworked. That also does a major disservice to the show.So, there you have it. The pros and cons of what I think are the new Dallas."
B008BF99F8 I wasn't going to watch this show because it seemed too much like a soap opera to me based on the previews, but boy am I glad I did! This show is amazing. I love all of the people on the show and I really enjoy the premise. Having never seen the original Dallas, I wasn't sure I would be able to follow this newer version, but I have no trouble at all. I would highly recommend this show to anyone interested in watching greed, scheming, lying, backstabbing, and a whole lot of family discord. It is just a fun show and a good time all around.My favorite character on the show is John Ross. He is very handsome and I just love his personality. I find myself rooting for him in every episode. My least favorite is Elena. I just don't like how she's portrayed...too saintly. All in all, watch Dallas!"
B008BF99F8 When I initially heard that the TNT network was planning to revisit Southfork ranch, I was more worried than I care to admit. How many shows have we seen lately that tried to reboot a previous success to somewhat disastrous results? A lot! And \"Dallas\" is such an iconic show that all but defined prime time soaps in the eighties (even if it began in the seventies and ended in the nineties). At its height, \"Dallas\" was a true cultural phenomenon and J.R. Ewing was TV's grandest villain. In the 2012 interpretation of \"Dallas,\" the makers opted for something completely inspired. Instead of another insipid reboot, they conceived an actual sequel--a continuation of ongoing storylines as envisioned twenty years later. And the results may just surprise you. While not perfect, this new \"Dallas\" is deliciously entertaining and one of the year's great guilty pleasures. Bringing back Larry Hagman (J.R.), Linda Gray (Sue Ellen), and Patrick Duffy (Bobby) for leading roles really works, Ken Kercheval (Cliff) shows true promise for future storylines, and Charlene Tilton (Lucy) is amusing if somewhat underused. Of the original cast members, only poor Steve Kanaly (Ray) looks quite lost at the occasional family function where he gets one line at most. And I credit the writers for not losing track of family and heritage, there is plenty of respect paid to former patriarchs and matriarchs Miss Ellie, Jock, and even good ole Digger Barnes.Before I convince you that this incarnation of \"Dallas\" is populated strictly by senior citizens, let me assure you that there is actually a sexy new cast to carry much of the plot forward. At the center of the story is J.R.'s hotheaded son John Ross (Josh Henderson) and Bobby's adopted son Christopher (Jesse Metcalfe) who feels he has to earn his place in the family. Like their fathers before them, the two have a long running feud. They have a genuine difference of opinions about the future of the Ewing family, and their antagonism is further inflamed by the woman between them (Jordana Brewster). To further complicated matters, Chrisopher is married to another (Julie Gonzalo). Beyond this quartet, the classic battle about drilling Southfork is prominent but updated for a new generation. In these ten episodes, there are plenty of double-crosses, a murder or two, steamy sexcapades, and lots more fun.The Good:1) Hagman has lost none of his conniving brilliance!2) The production values are glossy, the editing brisk, and the cliffhanger structure of the plotting keeps you hanging on to see what will happen next.3) The show's most magical pair has got to be Henderson and Hagman. This father/son duo has the best dramatic moments, the most intrigue, and the show's most sizzling chemistry.The Indifferent:1) Brewster is appealing, but see-saws back and forth so often between the guys, it's hard to really get behind her as a strong character.2) Metcalfe's clean energy plot line feels too vague, scripted, and convenient.3) A number of primary characters (including Bobby's new wife Brenda Strong) still have to be defined with more screen time.The not-so good:1) During the show, something happens that would absolutely end Sue Ellen's gubernatorial run but it doesn't seem to faze her campaign.2) I won't name names! But with the dazzling resurgence of Hagman, other performances feel a bit flat by comparison.Bonus features on this 3 DVD set with all ten episodes:(1) Southfork Legacy: Making Dallas Season 1, (2) Oil and Water: A Family Tradition featurette, (3) Back in Production behind-the-scenes feature, (4) Dressing Dallas Costume feature, (5) Who Shot JR? featurette, (6) Ewing Family Love Oak behind-the-scenes feature, (7) Pilot Commentary and (8) Deleted Scenes.Is \"Dallas\" a perfect new show? Absolutely not, but it has some incredibly strong elements and lots of room to grow and expand in Season Two. Beyond that, though, it's just plain fun. So why not visit? KGHarris, 10/12."
B008BF99F8 Can't wait to start watching this first season. When it started I was not allowed to watch but my brother and I would listen to it and now I can actually watch it."
B008BF99F8 This episode was everything a long time fan could hope for. i hope everybody buys this so they continue to make more. seriously. jr is as good as ever."
B008BF99F8 The new series thankfully brought back Larry Hagman at the start, as well as a few other familiar faces to introduce an even sexier generation of cast members to pick up the reins and ride Dallas into a contemporary era."
B008BF99F8 I'm an original fan, live a short distance from Southfork for the past 14 years and we original fans are the ones who buy & own all the DVDs. So they should take care to ensure we like the show. The dumbest thing they could do was to start the new show by having Bobby sell Southfork; ignore his son's heritage & opinions; and make stupid decisions without doing any research as if he was some dumb cowboy like Ray Krebbs with no business background. This story line was incredibly offensive to most original fans and alienated any loyalty to Bobby's character.  No one could feel any sympathy for him. What idiot wrote that? Duffy? Hagman?The new cast members all look alike & the writing will have to improve by 80%. Hopefully by finding some new writers who actually know the original series. For instance, Bobby did not inherit Southfork. Miss Ellie, via Clayton Farlow, signed over ownership of Southfork to Bobby in the last season and gave JR the control of Ewing Oil shares.  So John Ross could not overturn something that occurred before her Will which had nothing to do with Bobby owning Southfork.We all know the mineral rights for Southfork were always separate from the deed and used to trap Jeremy Wendell when dumb Ray sold his land. JR never would have forgotten that.Sue Ellen did not hide John Ross away at boarding schools... JR did. John Ross joined his mother because JR had become so consumed with James and destroying Cally over Weststar and Vanessa. So John Ross's comments were off base.The only 2 new characters with any charisma and character potential are Rebecca and Bobby's wife Ann. The rest of the new cast are duds and should be recast with new actors after they find new writers who actually watched the entire original series. Not some short attention span newbie who scanned through the episodes.Cliff's seething revenge attitude no longer makes sense. He owns Ewing oil and JR was a vegetable in a nursing home when the new series began. Cliff should be happy & gloating; not creating devious destruction plans and certainly would not hurt his nephew Christopher. Cliff also never wanted Southfork. That was miss Ellie's home, not oil well's that Jock stole from Digger. The only person Cliff should be angry at and seeking revenge upon is Afton who cruelly and illegally kept his daughter from seeing or knowing him. Or angry at JR; if & when he tries to take back Ewing Oil.Someone also needs to convince Hagman that those ridiculous eyebrows are not his trademark. They make him look like some Alzheimer geezer who is incapable of personal grooming. The eyebrows are nasty.Duffy and Hagman also need to do better with the characters of Lucy and Ray. Those fleeting cameos were an insult to the actors and fans. They were both core characters who battled JR. We need to see more of them but without repeats of old mistakes as if they never learned their lessons. They should be stronger and smarter now but angry with Bobby for the selling Southfork fiasco.Also, let us not forget about Lucas - Bobby's natural son, as well as James and Cally's baby who were both Jr's natural born offspring. They each have claims on the Ewing legacy.Focusing the later episodes of the original series on Bobby & JR with an endless parade of Bimbo's for their off~set pleasure is what destroyed Dallas the first time and permanently chased away Victoria Principal. Just look at the ratings after Pam and then even more so when Sue Ellen left and the ratings plummeted. Hagman & Duffy & the producer Katzman were so blinded by the procession of Bimbo's, they couldn't see their decisions were the problem.Dallas was not a male fan dominated series. Vast numbers of women watched it for the glamour & power & interactions of the cast. (Glamour: as in jewels, clothes, furs, money... not bimbo's and sex). Especially the interactions of Sue Ellen & Pam fighting back to hold their own. They ruined Pam by making her run away and whine instead of sticking by Bobby & fighting for their marriage. Sue Ellen was at her best when she was successful and not rolling in the gutter. The bimbo's were shallow and offensive to both male and female fans. Any viewers who need an endless parade of swimsuit models to keep their interest - are not watching Prime time soap operas. They are watching the X rated channels or out cruising street corners and bars.The producers should have a little common sense this time and don't depend on those hack Nielson ratings and opinions which never contact the actual audience and caused cancellations of wildly popular shows that has enraged fans for decades. Most of the fans and cast have died waiting for a new Dallas and the original Dallas DVD sets which took forever to complete; while some anarchistic Xgen tried to create a mockery comedy to get revenge on their parents generation. Thanks to Travolta for refusing to go along with it.Let us hope they learn from their mistakes this time before it is too late. This show can be a success again if they don't waste this second chance which has taken far too long."
B008BF99F8 This was the best remake ever. And Larry Hagman was still JR. The young family members are following there parents foot steps all the way. Looking forward to Season 2."
B008BF99F8 As someone who remembers the original Dallas, this reboot is fun, sexy, soapy and just the right amount of shirtless guys.  This is primetime soap at its best."
B008BF99F8 I only watched this because of Bobby, Sue Ellen and JR whom tried NOT to steal every scene they were in which is commendable because the storyline is older than dried up oil wells in Texas"
B008BF99F8 I am watching a current show with a youthful appreciation that it isn't a remake yet an enhanced version as I find myself still waiting for J R to get shot without concern about who.  I am pleasantly surprised that a guilty pleasure was so tastefully done that it does not play as revived, desperat, or anything other than Dallas."
B008BF99F8 JR is as rotten as ever. The cast and plot are great! Too bad Larry Hagman passed away. Can't wait for next season!"
B008BF99F8 Dallas: The Complete First Season, This is a great series, and well worth the money to own them. It picks up were the old series end but many years later."
B008BF99F8 Great show...hoping it continues.  Loved the old show as well.  Too bad JR is gone but love how he keeps his legacy alive."
B008BF99F8 Recently joined Amazon Prime and my first purchase was first season of the new Dallas.It was awesome and brought back so many wonderful memories of the 1980's,  The new cast membershave merged very well with former ones and you have a hit. My thoughts are with all the cast and crewand Larry's family today.  Hoping in the next season one of the first shows will be dedicated in his memory.BRM"
B008BF99F8 During the summer of 2012 cable's TNT aired \"Dallas\", not repeats, but a new series that is a continuation of the original CBS soap opera that ran from 1978-1991. People didn't know if the serial was going to be a hit or not as many believe (stupidly) that scripted dramas are a wave of the past and something viewers don't want to watch. \"Dallas\" became the highest-rated drama of 2012 beating even network shows and proved the timeless story of good vs. evil in a tight-knit Texas family who backstabs each other is still relevant today.With three of the original cast members included (Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy and most deliciously Larry Hagman as J.R.) along with a bunch of newcomers playing the sons of Bobby and J.R. (stud Jesse Metcalf (of \"Passions\" fame) as Christopher and Josh Henderson as John Ross, with excellent writing and direction, not to mention that timeless opening theme and music \"Dallas\" became the must-see TV event of 2012. TNT already has ordered 15 more shows for the summer of 2013 signalling their faith in the series.This set will include all 10 episodes along with a slew of bonus material including \"Southfork legacy: Making of Dallas-Season 1\" where the cast and creators discuss having \"Dallas\" come back, \"Back in Production\" where both J.R.'s (Larry Hagman and Josh Henderson) give a tour of the first day of filming, deleted scenes, pilot commentary with writer and executive producer Cynthia Cidre and executive producer and director Michael Robin and much more.\"Dallas\" it is so nice to have you back!!!!!Of special note Steve Kanaly, Charlene Tilton and Ken Kercehevel also return this year."
B008BF99F8 It's been so long since I saw Dallas, I forgot almost everything that happened. I'm enjoying it all over again."
B008BQ8VOC This is a fun, witty, and tense show that makes me wonder why it took me two years to jump on the bandwagon."
B008BQ8VOC Go ahead, try to watch this season without becoming attached to the characters. You'll get Litt Up, and understand why everyone was tweeting #saveDonna"
B008BQ8VOC The basic idea is that Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is faking a background as a Harvard Law graduate in a prestige NYC law firm.  He is able to bring this off with the help of a Sr, Partner in the firm, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht).  The premise is preposterous, No decent firm, much less a high priced Manhattan one, is going to hire an associate without at least a superficial check of his credentials.  Plus before long half of Manhattan seems to know Mike&#8217;s &#8220;secret&#8221;, including the managing partner of the firm (Gina Torres).  This puts her and the Macht character in the position of actively perpetrating a fraud on their million-dollar clients.  Not likely.OK, so why five stars?  Because the acting is noticeably above average especially the three leads and Rick Hoffman as the comic villain (I keep expecting him to say &#8220;Curses, foiled again&#8221;).  The characters are engaging and the writing is usually smart if sometimes silly.  But the shows big secret, I think, is that it maintains a level of dramatic tension and never stops to take a breath.  It is really fun to watch Ross and Specter &#8211; gunfighters hurling through the world of corporate law, firing citations from the hip and dropping arrogant competitors right and left.  It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that most of the employees at the firm look like former calendar models."
B008BQ8VOC This show started strong, and has only continued to grow throughout the second season. A mix of light and heavier fare makes this easy to watch, easy to fall in love with, and easy to stick with. Also, Gabriel Macht in a suit is worth an hour of anyone's time."
B008BQ8VOC Absolutely love this show. Great story lines that will keep you hooked. I love law (I even have a paralegal degree) and every once in awhile they sneak in a legal maneuver even I don't see coming. Can't wait for season 3."
B008BQ8VOC Constantly evolving plot.  Very interesting charactors. You really don't know how each person will change during the season. Can be watched each week with a different plot but the actors are changing over time."
B008BQ8VOC This series is a real surprise.  The characters are that - real!  My husband and I sit and guess where the storyline is going - we are always pleasantly surprised!"
B008BQ8VOC This show is a great show. It's very entertaining, and smart. I really hope they keep this show on the air."
B008BQ8VOC I jumped on top of this train all the way back in season 1.Was looking for something a bit different, that didn't take itself overly seriouslyand had a great ensemble cast.  It filled that bill quite nicely,The premise, Mike is a pothead (Sure there's a better, more current term), who also hasa sort of eidetic memory (can retain everything and apparently actually understand it allas well.)  To support his habit, he takes the bar exam for people.Premiere episode (which I give a 4 star rating), has him trying to hide at a hotel where theyare holding \"auditions\" for newbie lawyers for one of the biggest law firms in New York.Once he demonstrates his ability to Harvey, Harvey sneaks him into the firm as the newkid on the block.So, a lot of unbelievable action here, Harvey is a big time lawyer, big time money and he'sgoing to risk it all on (and I'm guessing here) a kid who is \"illegal\", no papers?hmmmm.Well, this all leads to some pretty entertaining episodes in season 1, I highly recommend that.Season 2, someone decides there needs to be some drama in the whole thing, so they bringback an old partner that they had managed to get kicked out of the company several yearsearlier.Again episodes not bad, actors do I think a bang up job on the whole deal, they're strivingfor more tension in the episodes, and the kicker here is that the old partner (founder actually)of the firm -may- be here to take the firm back.Throw rationality out the window, ignore consequences and you'll get a decent enough ride outof it, call it 4 stars because of the whole focus on Drama (with a capital D).Break in season 2, now they're back.Let's ignore the whole streaming taking several days to get the episode online (Amazon thing),I could rant about that for days.Series seems headed more into big D-rama, Mike melting down, and likely he'll recover hisfooting.  In the meantime, to me, it's sort of jumped the shark a bit.  The relationship betweenMIke and Harvey is on the rocks, Rachel is rightly pissed and Mike's off doing stuff that.... wellgiven the background they've laid for the character seems to be marginally believable, basedon what he had promised his now dead grandmother.LIke I say, I may well cancel the streaming for the next couple of episodes, come back laterand hope it finds it's groove again."
B008BQ8VOC I had never watched this show until I saw it on Prime. I took a chance to watch and fell in love with it. I loved the interaction of the characters. Just wish that three had been free too. Oh well, what are you gonna do?"
B008BQ8VOC Four stars why? The plot is not that spectacular. The pilot of the show was brilliant, wildly inventive, well acted for the most part.The reason why I would give this show four comes down to &#34;Harvey Spector, Louis Litt and the pot smoking apprentice. Louis Litt I found especially appealing and authentic in his own weaselly, ingratiating and venal way, chased with a side of self awareness and jabs at redemption. Spector comes across as one dimensional- the episode where he meets up with a lost love I found totally unconvincing. But still, the panache with which he delivers the biting sarcasm of some of his best lines is oiled smooth precision and that doesn't come cheap. As for the apprentice, whose name I forget, the portrayal is honest and as sublime as one's going to get in the show. For the rest of them, pretty much cutouts with plot lines well confined to the specifics of a law office, I presume. Knowing atmosphere flows pretty well on the show, also."
B008BQ8VOC this show kept me falling off the chair every time...i never knew lawyer are smart but this show is much smarter lawyer just kidding!!!"
B008BQ8VOC I started watching this on a wshim & got into it very quickly.  It's about an attorney who never loses (that gets boring after a few shows) and an ex druggie messenger boy who is brilliant and starts pretending he's a Harvard law grad and becomes Harvey's (never lose attorney) intern.  It's a fun premise but gets old after awhile.  The best thing this show has going for it are 2 &#34;minor&#34; characters- Donna, whi is Harvey's secretary, and Louis, who is Harvey's competition/ rival.  If it wasn't for these two characters I would stop watching it."
B008BQ8VOC Continue to enjoy. Love the witty banter, movie quotes, etc.  Continued character development has helped as well."
B008BQ8VOC The casting was excellent. The writers deserve an Emmy. It is sophisticated, emotional, compelling and &#34;real&#34;. The acting is superb. My only criticism would be the wardrobe for the ladies...too revealing and too over-the-top. Additionally, they all walk the same...very coached looking. I love &#34;Suits&#34; and would recommend it to all. Just wish there was a real-live Harvey/Mike in the judicial system."
B008BQ8VOC Season Two MUCH better than Season One.  For those watching 1st season; be patient - better CONTINUING plots in the 2nd."
B008BQ8VOC Always so much going on. Never a dull moment. Punch lines galore This series is funny as hell and yet has some serious moments."
B008BQ8VOC Suits is such a great, smart, well written show with a brilliant cast.  Gabriel Macht is amazing as Harvey Specter. Its interesting to see how things develop between him and Mike.  Donna is so much fun.  And then there is Lewis.  I usually feel at least two emotions a show where he is concerned.  Love him. Hate him. Feel bad for him. Laugh.  Jessica is very smart and one of the most elegant characters on tv.  Overall..AWESOME"
B008BQ8VOC I find the characters likable, even the ones who are more unlikable. Always entertaining. None of the people are perfect and all are rounded out with a sense of both seriousness and humor. Plot lines are wonderfully engaging."
B008BQ8VOC This show is so high energy and engaging!  I don't usually watch shows of this type, but the actors in this one are so great, and the dialog is so good, that I am happily hooked.  I can't wait to see what trouble Mike gets into next, or what outrageous stunt Harvey has to pull in order to save the day.  Even the theme music has me tapping my toes!  Here is a great package that I hope goes on for many seasons."
B008BQ8VOC I'm addicted! Binge watched yesterday to catch up and am now in Season 4."
B008BQ8VOC Fell in love with Season 1, however a new character is added to Season 2, and the focus on that character takes away from the quality of the show. I am still watching, hoping that things will change. However, it's becoming more of a soap opera, and I don't like going in that direction."
B008BQ8VOC Was shocked to hear Harvard-type people depicted using such low, deplorable language; certainly can't use that language in the average job--nor in a court room.  Why is it in there? A few awkward scenes.  Seems like a particular actress' episodes are awkward more often.  Disappointed that the writers don't realize how good they are without unnecessary contrivances to vulgarity; definitely hate the use of &#34;GD&#34;, &#34;BS&#34; and such detracts from t
B008BQ8VOC This is a fun series with lots of laughs & fun characters.  Not to be taken seriously - just enjoyed!"
B008BQ8VOC Always amazining twists and turns, did not think that I would like it but got completely hooked.  Can't wait for new season......"
B008BQ8VOC GREAT CHARACTERS. GREAT ACTION. GREAT SURPRISES. T he interplay between the legal eagles and their aides combine to make  the action fast paced and totally unpredictable."
B008BQ8VOC I wanted to watch season 3 so I started and began watching season 1 with Prime and then just kept rolling right into season 2. WHAT. A. SHOW. I was hooked from the first episode."
B008BQ8VOC Awesome show.  The actors are great and we enjoy every episode.  The banter between the two mains is fun.  Bing watching can be difficult because now we want the next season and it's not on Prime."
B008BQ8VOC The strong characters and sharp dialogue continue into the second season. A great watch once again. Still love the fasting."
B008BQ8VOC This season teaches that there is no such thing as perfect loyalty and perfect honesty when competing to be the best at practicing Law."
B008BQ8VOC This show has something for everyone and I also love how this show does not hinge on you seeing the previous week's show although we never miss it!!"
B008BQ8VOC This series is my favorite since it has interesting characters, unique plot twists and good direction.This goes way beyond the ordinary."
B008BQ8VOC An amazing show. I watch this on Amazon Prime; I gave up on cable a few years ago but this show almost makes me want to go back to it....NOT!"
B008BQ8VOC I love this show and I love Gabriel Macht.  I loved the second season, and now I'm now dying to start the third season."
B008BQ8VOC Excellent series, so many twist and turns it is awesome, and funny. The lawyers in this is series are unbelievable."
B008BQ8VOC One of my husband's friends recommended this show to him so we decided to check it out. We were able to watch the first season on Netflix but the second season wasn't available yet, so I pre-ordered it on here. It came quickly once released and my husband and I also enjoyed this season as much as the first."
B008BQ8VOC We like this show , because the main characters are so believable, and interesting~and their supporting characters are just that ~ strong, smart, sexy. (and others whom wanna be sexy!) Very well written story lines that make you watch, and have interesting twists~we used to put the Good Wife in the better category, but this show is more true to life with LESS agenda's shoved in our face and given attention to. Suits~can't wait for more!."
B008BQ8VOC My husband and I loved the second season just as much as the first.  In fact, we were so addicted that we finished the second season in one week and can't wait for season 3!!! An all round series that you can laugh, cry, and cheer, all while sitting on the edge of your seat.  It's the best entertainment with only one regret, that they don't make a new episode each day!  Best actors and writers - needs to get several awards."
B008BQ8VOC We finished season 1 and started season 2 immediately. We are hooked! Not only does the show have great drama, but also some very good undercurrent comedy. We love the sharp wit of the entire full time cast."
B008BQ8VOC i love suits the two main characters are fantastic,and this show even gets you to love all of the supporting characters,this is one show where i am going to have to buy the blu rays i could watch it over and over, it is intelligent, and funny in the best kind of ways see for yourself:)"
B008BQ8VOC I just love this show.  The dialog is snappy, engaging and filled with wit.  The characters are a bit over the top, but HEY this is television."
B008BQ8VOC I was caught with the first episode.  I just really enjoy the dialogue and the story line.  If I were going to be a lawyer, I would be Harvey. :-)"
B008BQ8VOC First few episodes take time to get used to but if you give it a chance it soon becomes addictive - it's as good as the Goodwife if you like attorney shows that have content an som humor. The key players are extremely good"
B008BQ8VOC Great dialogue...Great acting...captivating pace.I loved every minute of watching each episode to see the light side and the dark side of the law."
B008BQ8VOC Good show...not very original, but very entertaining and funny.  Definitely better than all those boring reality shows.  I looks Suits and will watch all available episodes"
B008BQ8VOC If you like the constant manuvering of the corporate world, this is for you. The personal stories fit well with the main storyline and frequently reflect eachother. Great stuff."
B008BQ8VOC After season 1 I just couldn't stop watching season 2. What I love about this season is how we get to see Harvey develop a closer relationship with mike and donna. how mike keeps developing into a tough lawyer but trying to maintain a kind heart while doing it. There are some backdrops but don't wanna ruin it and the ending....it was a hate and love moment for me. Hope this helps! Enjoy!"
B008BQ8VOC quality is excellent in HD,I'm actually impressed with it.show is available as  advertised.price is reasonable.streamlining is efficient ."
B008BQ8VOC Finished watching the season and it was good, but it was plagued with fits and stops coupled with error messages. Numerous reboots over the few days I watched only helped somewhat. Shut every other program down except that one window and still had problems. Never experienced problems with amazon streaming before. When it worked, the picture was bright and flawless. Other streaming services worked fine on my computer."
B008BQ8VOC I loved Season 1 and the concept of the series, Season 2 just continued with more surprises and interesting twists.  Characters are interesting and the episodes are frequently packed with dynamic performances."
B008BQ8VOC Same cast same plots it still works.  This is not a procedure show but about real people doing their job and letting us see all the warts."
B008BQ8VOC fresh, innovative, non-violent, law procedural with a twist that is compelling and amusing.  Corporate law has never been so interesting or entertaining."
B008BQ8VOC Fun series that is far from realistic. This is fantasy law in practice. Yet still worth while just for the fun of it."
B008BQ8VOC Good story line and entertaining because the cast was well picked.  There is still a problem with the ramped up background noise to the point of losing the dialogue,"
B008BQ8VOC Not really my feeling of entertainment. Too much arguing and bad attitudes plus I don't like the rude language. Crap"
B008BQ8VOC love this series and Gabriel Macht is great eye candy Good plots and interesting characters lots of fun to watch"
B008BQ8VOC This show is one of my favorites.  Between movie clips, bromance extreme, intelligent arguments, and witty banter, I hardly notice the delightfully sexy men in their beautiful suits.  Truly this show has one of the most gorgeous actors and actresses, but it is not just beauty.  Intelligent discussions and byplay truly make this show a must see."
B008BQ8VOC Suits is a great show. Just enough drama. Each week keeps you watching up till the end sneaks up and you have to wait till next week. One of the best features I find in Suits is that -- it's funny! The humor keeps it from getting too heavy. It's just a clever and fun show to watch."
B008BQ8VOC This series about a very very &#34;white shoes&#34; law firm is filled with dramatic episodes and it is very well acted."
B008BQ8VOC we find this show interesting, rather exciting, fast paced, a novelty in the world of other shows involving lawyers, will continue with the series."
B008BQ8VOC The characters develop nicely in this second season. Look for subtle  hints of ethnicity. What do you suppose the writers are implying.?"
B008BQ8VOC &#34;Your hard work really shined through.  It's obvious you've been at this a long time.&#34;David ColoradoI will audition"
B008BQ8VOC No, I can't put it in the same league with West Wing, but how many shows are?  This move fast, has great humor, plots and characters, some of which you may have at first despised only to find yourself having a little affection for... Oh, and sexy too."
B008BQ8VOC I love Mike and Harvey. This show has it all. It has drama, comedy, sex, backstabbers, and love. I am addicted. You have to see episode 1 of season 3."
B008BQ8VOC As I wrote in my previous review of this series, we love it!!  Acting and story oustanding!  You will enjoy watching every minute!  One of the characters named &#34;Louis&#34; sure makes you love/ hate him.....he's great along with the two lead stars!!  Looking forward to Season 3."
B008BQ8VOC Only through Episode 4, but still wanting more.  I thought I was critiquing the show in my first response to evaluating Suits Season 2 but the request was for Audio/Visual opinions only.  I have no idea where that got 'posted,' but where ever it is I gave a more detailed critique."
B008BQ8VOC This show is intelligent with brilliance performance by all cast and guest actors.  I hope the show in renewed for many years."
B008BQ8VOC This show continues to pull you in and keep you entertained.  While some shows go on and you aren't sure if you want to keep watching or not, this show does the opposite.  It entertains with every episode and continues to pull your attention.  Can't wait for more!"
B008BQ8VOC Was surprised by this show.  Didn't think that it would engage me and that the characters  would be convincing.  Many episodes end like cliffhangers, driving you to come back to see what will develop.  Series Two is full of these.  Recommend!"
B008BQ8VOC SUITS, one of the brighter shows from last season has returned for Season 2 and some changes have occurred. There is still the ongoing repartee between senior lawyer Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht) and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), the beautiful but always-serious head of the firm Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) casts her spell -but now we have the return of the old partner Daniel Hardman (David Constabile) to stir up trouble. Themes are more serious, the women play a more important part - Sarah Rafferty and Meghan Markle - and the nemesis Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) is as wily and oily and repulsive as ever. The storylines continue through episodes and the writing seems to be better fleshed out this year. Good wines are better with age and that is the case with this series. Grady Harp, August 12"
B008BQ8VOC Good acting and smart screenplay with a few exceptions.  It's a 4 star show not 5 as I rested by accident but its still good"
B008BQ8VOC the writing and the story line is very good all the actors do an excellent job and it is quite refreshing"
B008BQ8VOC It's not the greatest show I've ever seen, however, it keeps me watching and I love the camaraderie between the two male leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams  Now, let's talk about the women.  Gina Torres is spectacular as are the other two ladies, Meghan Markle as Rachel (a paralegal) and Sarah Rafferty as Donna, Mr. Macht's secretary.  They are the three sparklers on the show and can bedazzle you without trying.  Rick Hoffman plays the Rumplestiltskin of the group named Louis Litt.  (Mary Tyler Moore once had a line where she called Lou Grant \"Louis\" when she was berating him and it was one of the funniest lines she ever read because Louis sounds like something you would call someone when you were belittling him for his total lack of smarts.  The name is perfect for Mr. Hoffman in this role and he plays it beautifully.  On the whole, this is one of the better law shows because it is smart an funny.  The men, with the exception of Mr. Hoffman, are handsome and the women are \"che magnifique\"."
B008BQ8VOC interesting plot, lots of twists and turns.  the second season was just as good as the first one.  highly recommend."
B008BQ8VOC Couldn't stop watching. Love every character. Dialogue is fantastic. Can't wait for the next season. Keep up the banter. Thumbs up!"
B008BQ8VOC Check out my review of Season 1.  I have to say that the story(-ies) for the characters are developing much more and it's really got me hooked, so I give it four stars without reservations."
B008BQ8VOC We had heard suits was a good show but didn't start watching until recently.It's entertaining and fun to watch! I highly recommend it!"
B008BQ8VOC I really liked this show and was hooked from the first episode... The under dog, who has past the bar but didn't attend Havard and the power hungry lawyer who cannot loose a case.... The tale of how to make it in the world of vice and criminal activity.... Whilst being on the side of the law.......I can't wait for season three :)"
B008BQ8VOC Great stuff. How long can Mike keep his secret from everyone? There's some real nifty cliff hangers in this season. Makes a person wonder about morals, ethics, scruples, and remorse. With all of that in mind we're rooting for the money grubbing lawyers. That's some good writing and good acting to suck us in like that."
B008BQ8VOC I love this show about a very smart guy with a photographic memory who can read any book and understand it.  Then he becomes a lawyer in a big firm.  Pretty good con game here. Or lawyers are all liers and can't be trusted....."
B008BQ8VOC Still funny, quirky, interesting legal cases, and relationships among the various people at the law firm, especially between Harvey and Mike (and also Mike and Rachel).  But then it gets even better, because we are now starting to see a very gradual, but real development in the main characters.  With fits and starts, of course.  Most interesting is the slow awakening we seem to be seeing in Harvey as far as empathy and not just seeing himself as the only person in the world who matters."
B008BQ8VOC This show keeps getting better and better and better.  Now I am staying up way too late to watch more episodes so I can see what happens. Then I will be sad when I have no more to watch.  You bingers out there KNOW what I am talking about.  There are new characters, great plots, and we keep cheering for our starts.  SEE SUITS! Thanks."
B008BQ8VOC I wish season 3 was available.  this series just keeps getting better and better...but season 3 is not on prime..YET"
B008BQ8VOC It kinda reminds me of Boston Legal if Sorkin wrote it. Great characters, great cast and fun 'back & forth'. The story line isn't new but this show works. Of course, the fact there isn't one unattractive person seen anywhere... while unrealistic..  is just icing :-)Bravo!"
B008BQ8VOC I enjoy this series! I find it very suspenseful! All the characters are very interesting and you get to know them on a very personal level! I find myself sitting on the edge of my seat, really getting into the story line! If you enjoy a suspenseful show, you will not be disappointed if you buy it!"
B008BQ8VOC Great television series... witty, smart and fun.  Have watched 2 of 3 seasons and look forward to Season 3.  Seasons 1&2 were on Prime, but 3 charges so I'm recording the series to avoid the expense."
B008BQ8VOC this is fun show but at the same time very engaging with smart dialogue, definitely recommend watching. hope amazon has season 3 available soon!!!"
B008BQ8VOC I liked all of the actors portraying their different characters in the seasons.  Good acting really.  I was pleased with the series ending."
B008BQ8VOC This show is the best show I have seen on network TV sense Lost for me. I do love Person Of Intrest but they are both good in there own ways, I just think this is a better show, better acting because there is a larger group of awsome actors and the twist n turns. Love it! Give it a try you will be glad you did!"
B008BQ8VOC I love watching Suits and could watch it repeatedly. The characters seem like people we know in real life. The music is upbeat and cool, just like New York iCity is. Thanks to Amazon Prime for offering it."
B008BQ8VOC I can't rate the second season, but I did enjoy the first season.The story, although a bit far fetched, is still credible,The characters, are three dimensional, and well acted. You won't go wrong by watching this series."
B008BQ8VOC Loved the first season as much as the second!"
B008BQ8VOC The battle between good and evil continues, it is up to the beholder to decide how clear the boundary between the two. Thecharacters are complex, rendered very lifelike, the series is captivating (page turner if it were a book)."
B008BQ8VOC Interesting and funny with a bit of thoughtfulness. It seems like a good reflection on human behavior while staying lite and funny"
B008BQ8VOC Oh man... if you like witty comebacks and one-liners along with totally opposite characters that play against (and with) one another just perfectly, you will love this series."
B008BQ8VOC A fast action and at times a quite funny show! But when is PRIME going to let me see season three? The writing is superb as is the acting."
B008BQ8VOC I really enjoy this show for my fall-apart-friday nights.  I will admit the \"non-lawyer\" in season two is a little much with his moral issues, but the rest of the cast picks up the slack and makes up for it!  As good as season one, but your not rooting for the underdog as much.  I recommend, and cant wait for season three!"
B008BQ8VOC Even better than season one!! this is a high powered great series in the minds of the greatest lawyers!! Purchase now, you will not regret it!!"
B008BQ8VOC My wife and I enjoyed this season very much. All the characters are interesting and the plot is well developed. Quite fast paced."
B008BQ8VOC the best program on tv.  sex is around every corner and it sure raises the level of my bp.  i would recommend this program to everyone.  wish it was on every day..  gabriel is above and beyond and should be voted sexiest man in 1914.  the writers are extremely talented.  all of the actors are above and beyond for their parts they are playing.  i will buy every dvd of suits that comes out."
B008BQ8VOC When you hear Mike and Harvey bantering back and forth, it is the best conversation between two smart men I ever heard. Also, the plot lines are very smart making the legal profession seem brilliant at times. I will recommend this TV series to any discerning viewer who demands cut-above TV. The acting is very good and the pictorial scenery is spectacular. NYC is a great back-drop to this excellent series."
B008BQ8VOC Continues to keep your interest.  The characters are great, the writers have put so much into them and even the ones you don't like are that way because they are very good actors...  We so enjoy watching this show.  The two main characters, Harvey and Mike are so great together, what a pairing of talent.  Good Job."
B008BQ8VOC Very engaging.  Plots and sub-plots run the full gambit of Tragedy, Romance, Humor.  Liking the characters is a huge part of it and the series is very well cast."
B008BQ8VOC THIS SHOW KEEP ME GLUED TO THE TELEVISION ALL WEEK LONG. I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO SEE WHO WOULD COME OUT ON TOP. INTERESTING TAKE ON LAWYERS AND THE LAW. LOVE IT. PLEASE DON'T KEEP ME WAITING TO LONG FOR THE NEXT SEASON."
B008BQ8VOC EXCELLENT.The story lines and  the acting especially by Patrick Adams is fantastic.Gabriel is total eye candy and makes his charactor hateful and likeable. Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman...need more story lines around them but feel it is coming with the new season. They fill in and add more depth to the storys each week.If the idea of kick ass lawyers doesn't appeal to you .. then don't buy it. They swear, and there is &#34;safe&#34; sexual content. However the opening music will make  you want you to watch..."
B008BQ8VOC I am totally addicted to this show.  So disappointed that Season 3 is not Prime :/But it's a great show."
B008BQ8VOC The snappy and funny one-liners in season 1 were not as sharp in season 2, but still really good.  You have to wonder, though about the whole story line.  I mean, why would a brilliant lawyer, and a hugely successful law firm continue with the fraud, leaving themselves open to disbarment and possible criminal penalty, for the sake of a young, albeit adoring, gifted guy.  It doesn't make sense, but I guess I have to realize that does tv ever make sense?  I can't imagine that Harvey and Mike are on the outs because it is their combined chemistry that I fell in love with.  In any case, I hope season 3 comes back with more snappy and funny lines and great chemistry.  It was the light-heartedness that I love, so I hope it doesn't get all dark and serious.  And for goodness sakes, send Mike to law school so he can be legit!!!!"
B008BQ8VOC I enjoyed this series, but it began to get weaker in the plots.  The writers must have changed and some of the characters began to be irritating."
B008BQ8VOC I'm addicted to this show!  Love the characters and the intrigues each episode. Check it out, especially if you are prime, it's free!"
B008BQ8VOC We have a goofy theme about a genius who can't get through school but is practicing law and all the co-conspirators helping him. All I can say is I like it, and I want a job like these guys."
B008BQ8VOC I liked the actors who played all the parts. I also liked that he didn't show off because he was smart and the love for his grandmother."
B008BQ8VOC I think I would have done things differently had I been the owner of the firm.  I would, after finding out about Mike, given him a different title and job in the firm, like maybe research investigator. A win win for everyone."
B008BQ8VOC These people outdo each other on a minute by minute basis. Very quick repartee, smart and soooo entertaining. Love this show!"
B008BQ8VOC Really good entertainment.  Thoroughly enjoyable viewing.  Love all the characters - even Louis who acts like such a  mad rat is likable (at rare moments &#128513;)."
B008BQ8VOC Love this show, it's smart, funny, serious and enjoy the intricate plots.  Just when you think there is no way out, a tactful and smart outcome is just around the corner.  It's also at times realistic enough to accept a loss and justify it as the best outcome."
B008BQ8VOC The original plots, snappy banter, and quirky characters continue in this excellent and humorous drama revolving around suits in a Manhattan legal firm.  The arrogant and suave senior partner Harvey, cool and cerebral Jessica who manages the firm, the boyish and brainy assistant Mike, and the irritating rat Lewish will charm you.  It's worth watching for Jessica's wardrobe along if you like that sort of thing.  The plots thicken with the return of the firm's owner Daniel Hartman.  It's a great show - wonderful to watch it free through Prime."
B008BQ8VOC I gave Suits Season 2 five stars because it's just a great show! I love this season better than season 1 and season 1 was very good.I recommend this show to anyone who loves a good laugh and anyone who loves drama."
B008BQ8VOC I enjoyed the 1st season a lot and  was glad that we also had season 2 on our Amazon streaming. These characters are serious but still have a fun side  to them. I can't wait for the 3rd season to be available to us .I have never seen any of the actors in any thing else on T.V or movies, but the acting is first rate. Harvey is awesome and of course Mike is also, I love Donna and wish her and Harvey would have a story line, what  a twosome."
B008BQ8VOC This was a great season, though it became very complicated in the final 2-3 episodes.The pace is fast and the characters never boring.  I love to watch Gabriel Macht more than any of the others.  His facial expressions are perfect and he never seems to be out of character.This show is perfect for young adults and over.  I am 70, so I catch many of the innuendos involving movies and TV shows of the past.  It is a smart, intelligently written show which does not degrade or lower the expectations of the viewer."
B008BQ8VOC From Season one we have been enjoying this show.  &#34; If you like Mad Men then you will like SUITS&#34;"
B008BQ8VOC Smart writing, good acting.  Lots of &#34;xo's&#34; to fill out Amazon's stupid word count requirement on comments.... xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo"
B008BQ8VOC If you enjoyed the first season, odds are you are going to buy this one.  I highly recommend this show."
B008BQ8VOC My husband and I both watch this show every night.  We are absolutely addicted, sometimes watching two or three in a night.  The plot is intellectual and the sub-plots are always engaging.  We are now on the third season and even more involved than when we started.  In my humble opinion, this show is at the top of it's game.  Watch the first season and I'll guarantee, you are hooked.  If there were an Olympics for TV series', Suits would most definitely be in the running."
B008BQ8VOC Well written, superbly acted, should I say more? I am so glad I came across this show. I am tired of all the other same old, predictable, boring shows. Finally a good one.I was hesitant at first, to watch it or not (because it is about lawyers), but I am so glad I did.Season 1 was good, but Season 2 is great! Can't wait for Season 3!"
B008BQ8VOC What an interesting series...filmed in toronto and pretending to be nyc.  only the natives recognize local sights and buildings.  writing is excellent and acting is great.  gabriel macht is a loveable douchebag well paid lawyer.  he grows on you and his new side kick slash apprentice steals the show!"
B008BQ8VOC Didn't think I wanted to watch another lawyer show. But I watched a couple of episodes and got hooked right away. Love the cast and the story lines. Surprisingly good show. Highly recommend."
B008BQ8VOC want to see more, but i think this was a series that they wanted to charge for the 3rd year, a 1.99 and episode.i pay enough for the year don't need to pay for episodes.if that was not the case, they didn't have the later years available.anyway, wish there was more. I REALLY LIKED IT"
B008BQ8VOC And yet another television series about the legal profession.  The legal firm in question is a small partnership whose practice is exclusive to rich and powerful corporations or CEOs with the exception of the mandatory pro bono work. The \"twist\" is that one of the associates passed the bar without attending any law school, much less Harvard Law. The scripts are run of the mill, but Gabriel Macht, and the actress who plays the head of the firm have enough magnetism to rise above the scripts.  Second lead, the young associate sans formal legal training is pleasant but IMHO lacks chops. The \"villin\" of the show, the attorney responsible for the care and feeding of new associates is \"Dishonest John\" without the mustache. The character is written way over the top, but the actor playing him is very watchable and skilled, he manages to make a ridiculous part seem credible, and his mobile features contribute immensely to making the show watchable."
B008BQ8VOC Amazon includes the first two seasons and then your hooked.... Enough to pay for season three?Not so far, yet."
B008BQ8VOC After watching season 1, I had to watch what would come next and I was thoughly please. In love with Patrick J. Adams"
B008BQ8VOC While I do like the show, it can be cheesy at times.  I do like how they end each episode, making you want to watch more, I don't like the cheesy one liners, not the awesome ones but the ones about feelings...blah blah blah my heart, not to interested in emotions I just want action."
B008BQ8VOC Something endearing about the characters in this show. We look forward to each episode and hope this series goes on for many more seasons."
B008BQ8VOC We are still getting segments added to Season 2 and enjoy each.  We really prefer buying a programming season rather than spending money for a TV channel that gives you lots of uninteresting and stupid programs."
B008BQ8VOC I'm on Episode 14 and just think it's the BEST, trying to budget more time in my schedule to watch it."
B008BQ8VOC ... But you have be able to get over the fact that this kid is not an attorney and everyone is okay with breaking the law. Its a stretch and pretty much a needless one. They could have just made the story around him being an attorney but from a B-rate university since the firm only hires Harvard grads (which you never want to do unless you want a handful of overinflated egos and not that much personality or talent in your entire office) and hidden that fact from the group. There are interesting enough story lines to keep you watching."
B008BQ8VOC The entire series is entertaining, but not very realistic.  But then who would watch anything that was at all a depiction of real life.  That would be mostly dull and routine and get as boring as many jobs do in real life."
B008BQ8VOC I won't tell you what that word, finally means. You'll have to watch the last episode to this season to find out. But let us say that season two is as good as one. However, I'm not sure I want to go on from there. Best to let good things remain good and not give the writers a chance to disappoint."
B008BQ8VOC Entertaining - the characters interact beautifully - they have flaws, yet seem to make the best of any given situation - would recommend this show!!"
B008BQ8VOC Oh and Gabriel Macht is good eye candy...I do watch for fashions even though I could never slip into some of the outfits"
B008BQ8VOC Fun, good ACTING, witty exchanges between the two major characters.  Stylish and clever.  Legal and corporate basic setting.  Good choice."
B008BQ8VOC he first season was so great I watched the second in a matter of a few days, Good thing I was sick so I could have an  excuse to have my own marathon. As long as it keeps moving like it does I will continue to watch ..You will love it if you like Law stories and the legal system films very good,"
B008BQ8VOC I love this show...even guys that I know love this show...we all have conversations about it...Don't ever change, Harvey! We love you!"
B008BQ8VOC The plot is great, the characters are well written and acted. Certainly if you liked Season 1, you'll like season 2 even better. But opinions will vary obviously and vastly. Either you'll love the show, or you will watch something else. I'll also take a quick moment to rate Amazon Prime delivery of the content ( FLAWLESS )."
B008BQ8VOC Actually liked Season 1 a little better, but this is still entertaining.  What we noticed unfortunately was the excessive use of &#34;God d**n&#34; over and over and over in some episodes.  So much so that it really becomes annoying.  The show and character development is done so well that it is sad that they seem to feel the need for the &#34;cursing&#34; to add what? Credibility? We find it so overused that the character sounds silly."
B008BQ8VOC This was an awesome second season can't wait to see Season three this season kept your interested right to the end of the season. A must see.."
B008BQ8VOC I love this show but I wish they would get back to it being mostly funny and less drama. I would strongly recommend it!"
B008BQ8VOC Simple and sweet. Love the recap and especially want Donna back. She is a big part besides Harvey needs his sidekick."
B008BQ8VOC Much like with Season 1, I watched this on Amazon Prime for free with my membership. I had never seen any of the episodes, now there is no way I will miss any of them!"
B008BQ8VOC I have binge watched this show and am now on Season 3...wish there were more for me to watch. Great plots and interactions between all the players!! A MUST SEE"
B008BQ8VOC Began watching this series about a month ago - could not get it on my local rural cable service. I like the pace, the dialogue and the relationships developed in season 1 and that continue in season 2. Looking forward to Season 3 - a challenge not to &#34;view ahead!&#34;"
B008BQ8VOC I love watching this show. It is always with a twist to keep you thinking. I hate that I am at the end of the free season."
B008BQ8VOC Really enjoyed the show. This season the plot gets a lot more intense. Never a dull moment. Cant wait to watch the next season."
B008BQ8VOC The second season is a lot better than the first!  Lewis is great.  Love that man!  I have to put 4 more words for this to qualify as a review. Otherwise Amazon will keep sending me a reminder to review things."
B008BQ8VOC I love most USA programming b/c they're well written, clever, witty...........just plain BETTER than most other networks!!!  Give their shows a chance and quit watching trashy reality TV.  Relax instead with great acting & writing - live vicariously through them!  Way better than the stupidity on reality shows."
B008BQ8VOC As i have said before if you were a fan of Boston Legal you will like this series. There is an appropriate mix of banter, humor and strategy. Although at times you are left trying figure out what exactly happened it is for the most part a relatively easy plot line to follow with a few unexpected twists to make it just unpredictable enough to hold your interest."
B008BQ8VOC Well, I thought I would try this video library service since it was the one reasonable way that I could view an episode before the new season started.  The video was viewable on my laptop and was excellent quality.  The issue that I had with this service is that unlike DVDs. I have to be hooked up to stream the media.  I can't just download it and burn it to DVD, at least not eazily.  The result is that I cannot share this video with my Mother who is now hooked on season one.  I don't mind the video library, but I must have a way to view this offline.  Oh yeah.  My TV in the living room is internet connected through an X-box; however, the only way to view the video is to subscribe to Microsoft through some Gold membership.  Quite expensive for a video wouldn't you think.  I will now search for the DVD so that I can watch it anywhere I like!"
B008BQ8VOC This is a great series. The dialogue is wonderful, and the characters are consistently quirky. Great fun and interesting plots and sub-plots."
B008BQ8VOC This series is well done with huge character development during each episode. The story line is a complex multi level mixture of love, hate, admiration and respect. If you are looking for television that has the same feel as reading a good Book, Suits is your best choice."
B008BQ8VOC Great series, edgy, smart and funny!  Suits is a cutthroat means to an end in fast paced NY style. A must see!!!"
B008BQ8VOC I'm hooked and can't wait for season three! Those two have to get back to being friends! Harvey must forgive Mike."
B008BQ8VOC The only bad thing about this season is we watched it immediately & now we have to wait a year or more for the next season.Come on season 3!!!"
B008BQ8VOC It's a modern telling of my fair lady. You pick someone no one would expect and you turn them into the belle of the ball. Or in Mike and Harvey's case the intern everyone want to be. Harvey never fails to charm a client and if charm doesn't work. Enter Mike who can get Harvey information he maybe shouldn't have."
B008BQ8VOC Each episode is dished up with the same pace, conviction, drama - leaving you hungry for more. What will happen between the characters next? What new conniving strategy will threaten to unsettle a recent detente? What a treat to finally come across a show that isn't replete with boring prejudices and platitudes!"
B008BQ8VOC A great season that showed you a lot about both main characters and was extremely fulfilling in every episode througout."
B008BQ8VOC Can't get enough of this show! Just enough drama with some slices of comedy thrown in...makes for the perfect thing to watch to unwind after a day at the office."
B008BQ8VOC Addictively likeable characters (some that you'll love to hate) that will have you obsessed with watching way passed your bedtime."
B008BQ8VOC It's so refreshing to find a truly innovative show that doesn't entail a ton of violence.  This is well acted, well directed and very well written.  I'm so looking forward to Season 4 when it is available for Prime!  Watch it, you will get hooked!"
B008BQ8VOC The script in this program is excellent.  The dialogue is fast, so it keeps you on your feet.  Expect the unexpected just as in the corporate world.  Well casted, each is equally strong in their role."
B008BQ8VOC Can't wait until this show resumes!  It is smartly written and very clever!  My favorite character is Donna and her relationship (whatever that may be) with Harvey!"
B008BQ8VOC Great characters, great stories.  Been following this since it came out in season 1, and it's been a well-written series with fresh material for each story arc."
B008BQ8VOC Again, a very well done season. Ive seen the first three seasons now and I cannot wait for the fourth. Didnt think this would be my kind of show, but boy am I glad I didnt judge a book by its cover! Great, witty, funny, excellent show. 5+ stars!!!!"
B008BQ8VOC I am hoping to see season 3 soon. The first 2 seasons were a hoot. Older lawyer mentors younger lawyer. Or maybe not, The younger lawyer has some tricks to teach."
B008BQ8VOC Two guys bringing their special skills and unique perspectives to the law office.  I like the twists and turns of the relationship."
B008BQ8VOC Liked the first season but the second is even better. Gets more into the characters pass and how everything came to be. Love how these characters are evolving and growing. Can't wait for season three."
B008BQ8VOC This show is fantastic. Great writing, very witty and most of all great acting. I would highly recommend this show to anyone and season 2 is honestly even better than the first. If you also enjoy lawyer based shows you would love it. Its also very intelligent not just witty humor which there is plenty of. There are some oversteps they make about legalities but nearly everything is pretty spot on."
B008BQ8VOC My wife had me watch this with her and i thought i would hate it. But i got hooked after one show. Awesome show."
B008BQ8VOC Lots of twists and turns.  Plus it's lite and funny at times.  Keeps you wanting more and guessing what's next!"
B008BQ8VOC Fast. Witty. Suits is on a roll. All the New York kind of attack now and ask questions later that gets people in trouble all the time. Not my style of living, but curious to watch."
B008BQ8VOC The characters on Suits are absolutely fantastic! The chemistry between Harvey and Mike has definitely matured but the writers put enough humor into the script that it doesn't hinder their relationship."
B008BQ8VOC The second season is not as good as the first. The plots have some minor flaws in it. But it is good entertainment."
B008BQ8VOC I started watching Suits at the end of Season 2 on USA and got hooked immediately!  With Season 3 starting I needed and wanted to know everything on the show so bought both Season 1 & 2 and stayed up late for 2 weeks watching them....so awesome!!! Patrick J. Adams is adorable!!  He's so witty and his expressions make me laugh!! I highly recommend Suits to everyone...it rates right up there with White Collar in my book...USA shows are the best!!"
B008BQ8VOC It has some language and sexual situations, but the fact that they point out that some of their behavior is wrong is refreshing.  The story line is interesting and keeps your interest which, in my opinion, is rare these days."
B008BQ8VOC My husband and I love this show and this was a particularly great season.  We like that this is a Lawyer show without the usual blood and gore that accompany that type of show."
B008BQ8VOC I gave it a 4 stars rating for story plot, then added another star for superb acting.  I gave season 1 a four star but this season had better acting."
B008BQ8VOC The actor who plays Louis Litt is just awful.  He's a lousy actor, and he's truly unattractive.  No tv show would have a female principal character who is this ugly and one dimensional.  Why do viewers have to endure such lousy casting and acting when the character is male?"
B008BQG3RE They did it again. Like in the first season, the final episode was very interesting and it made me wait want to watch the second season with even more desire than the first one. Same here. Who are those new creatures from the final episode? Do they come in peace or are they the new enemies? I wish and hope that season 3 will be as good as these 2 seasons and that it will come out soon. And as always, great story, nice special effects, awesome acting.  Very entertaining series, definitely was worth watching!"
B008BQG3RE Awesome series. Steven Spielberg had his hand in it. He went deep. Deep and hard. Cant wait for the next season."
B008BQG3RE this was a good continuation to season 1. after, it kept me interested. there was enough development of the characters to warrant another season."
B008BQG3RE I really enjoyed this si fi season and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys si fi as well. thanks"
B008BQG3RE This is one of the best series on TV and I hope it continues to get better and better and not become boring as so many others have"
B008BQG3RE This season isn't as good as the first. Well, it's just different I guess. But it's still good. Entertaining. Watch it."
B008BQG3RE I got into this series a few weeks ago by starting the (free) first season. I kept watching through the whole series. I finished the first season in about 10 days. The second season is so good, I finished it in less than a week. This is a really great story, unpredictable enough to keep you guessing but not so far off base that you can't enjoy it."
B008BQG3RE I have not missed an episode since this first started ~ excellent show, excellent actors (young & older) ~ my only complaint is how fast it seems each episode goes ~ I would really love to see each episode last at least 1 1/2 hrs, maybe even two.."
B008BQG3RE Very exciting...just what a sci fi fan wants!!!  I want to cheer for the main characters each time I view Falling Skies."
B008BQG3RE Some actors are stiff in first season but director is giving freedom for actors to develope their part, special effects are very good and we know that shooting is very difficult on the road but crew is doing a great job. Shooting in rainy weather or with snow is a very natural touch and shows crew & cast dedication. Nice editing to give that end of the world climate. Unexpected cliffhanger but the problem now is the 3 season is not released yet of this date Nov 2012"
B008BQG3RE The thing about watching Sci Fi on Prime is that you can follow the stories and engage without the hassle of commercials.  The story for Falling Skies was good for season two BUT let's home season three doesn't fall from the sky as well and end up a disaster of cliches."
B008BQG3RE My wife and I watch \"Falling Skies\" without fail. Since, we cancelled cable cable we stream it from Amazon.com. Beats paying a cable bill!"
B008BQG3RE Edge of seat production. Solid story line, lots of action. Characters are well deveoped and followed in each of the episodes."
B008BQG3RE Some reviews have called it too slow, and not enough action.  I am older and find the slower pace easier to follow, and the special affects are extremely well done (what would you expect from Steven Spielberg?) and the action suits me fine.  If you want lots of blood and guts, look elsewhere.  I enjoy the personal angles, Pope gives you plenty of action usually, and the Professor Noah Wylie plays perfectly, his affection for his sons comes across totally sincere.  I also like the Captain, he plays the part to a tee.  I would recommend it definitely.  Can't wait for season 3 to begin."
B008BQG3RE Great action= adventure drama.  Love Noah Wiley and all the other supporting staff.  I would highly recommend it for all."
B008BQG3RE This series' sequence bothered me, as it didn't start at the BEGINNING; so there was no time to develop the backstory and empathy with the characters.  I understand why the director or film editor chose to instead start the story as it was done, but really folks: the viewer doesn't know the story as well as you do, so when you start the story with a firefight but no preceding character development, the action can't be followed: so the viewer quickly loses interest.I lost interest.  Only because Will Patton was in it, did I come back and finish the series here in Amazon Prime.  That first episode was all rush rush rush with stock stereotypes, too much dialogue at too low a volume versus the too-high music (remember, this is streaming, not analog, so the sound compression makes voice harder to hear, and music too loud).  It was disconcerting, all the scene switches, looking very much like a cheap SyFy thingy.  I forced myself to go through the first episode, turned off.Yet to see Will Patton's wonderful nuanced acting, I came back, half-watching; then the series began to pick up pathos, in later episodes.  The best thing about this series is that it is ONE story with many subplots, instead of the usual wash rinse repeat of side plots which distract from the longterm storyline.  This is the key to a winning series, and all the great ones -- LOST, Invasion, The Fugitive -- always kept a central eye on advancing the longterm plot.Given that need, it would have been better if they dealt with the aliens first, something of why they were there, THAT they were there, and a good series of episodes preceding, showing the attack, instead of starting with fingerpaintings.Even so, once it picked up pathos, then we could individuate the characters and invest in them.  Patton got to show a lot of variation in his character, which is a welcome relief from the typecasting he's had to endure, lately.  Overall, the ensenble cast played well also, very good acting, considering the staccato nature of the scenes (which confuse the viewer).  It was too fast-paced.  I understand the philosophy behind that, but again if you want to invest the viewer you need to make the scenes RELEVANT first, not just shoot-em-up survival scenes, of which we already see, too many.Once Season 2 began, it slowed enough to catch onto the story, which is well-told.  Season 3 begins June 9, on TNT at 9 pm/8 Central Time!"
B008BQG3RE This show has bits of previous alien invasion hits throughout. A steady progression of the plot keeps it from getting stale or hokey."
B008BQG3RE I guess I like the idea, but I still find it hard to like the lead character.  I think they should blast him.  I'll continue watching, but hope they develop a better lead.  They need to kill Pope to, his character is a bit ridiculous."
B008BQG3RE I really like this show, it's like walking dead meets battlestar galactica and more. I don't think it tackles certain things quite as well as either of those shows but I feel like it's better than most of whats on tv right now. definitely worth a watch."
B008BQG3RE The title says it all.  I like the characters, their personalities and ther back story and situations they find themselves in are believable.  The actors are good enough that I get lost in the character and not 'this person playing this character'.  I suppose it's low budget in terms of special effects but it works for me - I don't spend my time picking it apart.It's good entertainment and I think probably suitable for children since the violence isn't too graphic or too common."
B008BQG3RE Liked it a lot, can't wait for the next season.  Hope there are more shows like this in the works."
B008BQG3RE Falling skies is a great mixture of sci fi and human drama. You care about the characters. Which makes this show and the walking dead excellent."
B008BQG3RE I love the walking dead so I was surprised when I found I ended up  watching this on amazon I didnt want to stop watching, waiting for the next move to survive."
B008BQG3RE Yet another verry stupid &#34;hollywood&#34; idea of how to &#34;fight a war,&#34; any war.  I especially liked the part where, while being hunted by an enemy who has absolute control of the air and space, the &#34;resistance&#34; find a hospital with a generator and what do they do?  They fire the generator up, light up the hospital like Times Square, and &#34;rest&#34; there for a couple of weeks.  Of course the enemy never notices this brightly lit hospital.  That's ok though, the enemy never notices them driving around, at night, in military tactical vehicles with the HEADLIGHTS ON!  Oh, and we must not forget going out on &#34;patrol&#34; while having extremely LOUD internal &#34;Ihate you, you hate me, we all love one another&#34; fights.  During which, while there is much shouting, no one is paying any attention to their surroundings.Any &#34;resistance&#34; unit, in an occupied territory,  operating like this, would be wiped out in hours.The only reason to watch this show is, there is nothing else on."
B008BQG3RE Once you get past the 1st season the second season gets really good. A little more action and but a little less fighting to me."
B008BQG3RE I like that humanity must work together and give up their differences to conquer the bad ETs but quite honestly I would like to see the good ETs and what they have to say about humanity."
B008BQG3RE I love this show it is great, I can never wait until the next season.  I love to rewatch the previous season right before the new one airs.  Blu-rays were great and go the UV digital copy too."
B008BQG3RE I like this solid Sci Fi TV series because it has excellent relationships, brilliant special effects, excitement, good family values, smart writing, understandable and involving human dilemmas, solid main and supporting actors, smart directing. I just like it a lot."
B008BQG3RE since i don't have cable, found this by looking at sci-fi in prime videos.  so glad i did.  can't wait for season 3!"
B008BQG3RE For a review on this season the review placed on Season 3 should be read. This series is truly amazing and mind grabbing. I can't wait for the next episode each season."
B008BQG3RE This series started off decently enough, but as it has gone on, it has, in my opinion, become less and less believable. It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel wouldn't mess around with bombs and lasers. If they really wanted to exterminate the native species, they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100% kill rate. Also, some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013. I am not sure that I will waste the time on in next summer."
B008BQG3RE Wasn't sure where they could go with the series after the first season but man that was great...bring on season 3!!"
B008BQG3RE I find the writing to be engaging and exciting. I prefer stories that are a bit messy such as in real life. They tend not to button issues up nice and neat"
B008BQG3RE Noah Wyle definitely landed himself a steady paycheck when he signed on for this show! He rocked In ER and has certainly rocked even more in Falling Skies! I can't wait for Season 3!!"
B008BQG3RE This picks up right where season 1 left off.  I like the series.  The acting is excellent and the story lines are solid.  The pace can be slow at times, but I believe it is to develop the emotional undertones of the plot.  Wish there were more series like this, with more emphasis on quality writing and story lines."
B008BQG3RE This is a great SciFi end of world series. The acting is topnotch the characters are realistic. The CG and makeup is excellent. I can not wait for Season 3"
B008BQG3RE This is absolutely SciFi at its best. Good actors, good story line! Can't wait until the next season comes out!"
B008BQG3RE Start watching with season one to keep up with the story lines and follow up with second season to learn more of what is happening in the war to save mankind willing to protect the children as well as children taking up the fight as well to protect themselves and mankind."
B008BQG3RE Great story it's is sort of twisted from the normal Alien show and has a story that is aimed for that... Even non geek/tech scifi fans can get into it because of that. It s based in a post apocalyptic war earth where we lost the war. and focuses mainly on the rebel aspect of tryinng to take the earth back a fun show worth the watch."
B008BQG3RE There is not one bad word I can think of regarding this program...perhaps some bad language here and there-but that is it.  Action packed, relationships in the throws of chaos, aliens at every turn.  Spell binding."
B008BQG3RE I think the second season of falling skies is more intense than it's 1st season.. more action more drama.. cannot wait until the third installment is out on blu ray.."
B008BQG3RE I was kinda not interested then watched at a friends. Came home and before I knew it season one had been watched. I am hooked!!!"
B008BQG3RE If you like Sci-fi then you will love the second season of Falling Skies. Awesome show great acting good story."
B008BQG3RE Thoroughly enjoyed this action drama as did my family.  We would like to see more sci-fi like this.  Would recommend."
B008BQG3RE This political siren of imagination belies the depths of sincerity of what your enemies and your allies can be trusted to show the truth. First the take over without warning relates to what happened with our countries recent take over by the left. The lies of the right are the allies that say they are here to help but only in order to help themselves regardless what your desires are. A perfect story to help the youth of today understand how politics work and how alliances can't always be trusted and are only worth the effort to a certain point."
B008BQG3RE One great fun TV show. Hope it is one for Years to come. I see it has SDH for the hard of hearing like season one did. One thing. I got it at Target for a buck less + tax. The shipping here a Amazon is getting to be very slow. And they put tax on things now. For a buck less  I can have it in my hand now. And doing so more and more. On something's Amazon is well worth it.  But if I can get it at Target/China Mart for a few bucks more are less I do....But this is a great fun TV show..."
B008BQG3RE Being a big sci fi fan, I enjoyed both seasons of the series.  It's not Downton Abbey or even American Horror Story but it's definitely worth watching."
B008BQG3RE Every episode was exciting. I couldn't wait to get to the next one. Don't know how I missed it when it first was on TV."
B008BQG3RE One episode in, I plan to watch another. The apocalyptic world view isn't something I dwell on, so I am not &#34;sold&#34; on the idea, but the characters were engaging."
B008BQG3RE so addicted to this show...i watch it over and over again. I can,t wait for the 3rd season to start."
B008BQG3RE On the technical aspect the season of Falling Skies 2, looks very nice on our TV, volume is clean even though we wish it was louder sometimes. On the story and acting, is on top of the heap of neighboring competitors. The acting is generally good, the script-which is understandable-has moments when they are just filling up the gaps, but it still manages to entertain very well. What a concept, war with aliens on earth soil. Nice special effects. 4 Stars."
B008BQG3RE I may not be the best judge of this series since I am a sucker for invasion stories but for what it's worth, this is a worthy addition to the genre and far better than the overacted, underwritten nonsense that television usually puts out (Yes, I mean &#34;V&#34;). Noah Wylie brings gravitas to his role and the rest of the cast is very good. It still suffers from the Star Trek syndrome, too often finding solutions to problems that should occasionally not be solvable but I still recommend it."
B008BQG3RE Slow movie with predictable outcomes. This could have been a winner!!!???  but I found myself bored at times.... GOODLUCKDave"
B008BQG3RE Family relationships grow amongest charecters.  A little repetitive, but keep watching.  A bit dark, would caution parents from viewing with children under 16."
B008BQG3RE The first two seasons are worth purchasing.  You will like this series if you are a fan of The Walking Dead!  Although, not quite the same it very much along the same lines."
B008BQG3RE Season Two begins with several moments of high drama. When Ben goes back to shoot an Alien after he&#8217;s been ordered to retreat he accidentality seriously wounds his Father Tom who was standing behind the critter. When Hal confronts his younger brother later about disobeying a direct order the encounter results in a tussle in which Ben overpowers Hal forcing him to his knees. As Ben walks away Hal adjusts the automatic rifle on his back, straightens that back, and walks away a mixture of humiliation and struggle for self-control playing on his face. Meanwhile Anne who has operated on Tom who remains unconscious struggles with the fact as the only doctor around she is forced to treat the people she loves.The group is at war with the aliens and soldiers die. As Noah says in one of the supplements as Producer he feels relatively safe. Any large group has dissidents and troublemakers and this one is no different. The group spends most of this season struggling to make it to Charleston and when they do discover all is not well in utopia. Politicians and the military make uncomfortable bedfellows. Noah&#8217;s Tom has to struggle with the fact that his boys are becoming men prematurely and decide where he is going with his relationship with Anne. This is definitely an adult series."
B008BQG3RE An interesting take on alien adventures. Wish there were moreadventures with the aliens and not so many interactive humandramas, which we already know too much about."
B008BQG3RE great show, got hooked watching seasons one and two on amazon prime, wish they'd make season 3 prime (free) too.mark this review helpful if you agree.how can you not get hooked?UPDATE: Season 3 was short, wanting more!"
B008BQG3RE Each episode is worth watching and keeps the story going.  The last show leading to season three makes you want more.  Good drama with enough sci-fi."
B008BQG3RE This show has everything, love,drama,sci-fi,adventure. I think this is one of the best shows on TNT TV. Keep up the good work."
B008BQG3RE Still needs more action and better actor development.  Almost too many things going on at one time, but still good."
B008BQG3RE I was watching the previews for season 3 of this show. I'd never seen any episodes but the previews really caught my attention. I wanted to see the previous 2 seasons so I checked Amazon Prime. They had them for free so I watched them to catch up. It's a great show."
B008BQG3RE I burned through the first season within a couple of weeks and was glad to see the remaining 2 seasons were available in order for me to get my Sci-Fi fix.This is a great series and I can't seem to get enough. The mix between the battles, character building and personal conflicts within the group is well balanced and can make the show appeal to just about anyone."
B008BQG3RE Again with the Twilight crap, a lot of boy meets girl stuff, sexual tension, and all, doesnt really concentrate on the tactical, strategic stuff, action,...bla bla. You know another thing, in the beginning of the series they portray the aliens as vastly superior to us, more intelligent,... and then now it seems you can kill them by stabbing them in the mouth, shooting their limbs off,.. also didnt they find that new material for making bullets? So why didnt they just cast bullets and reload for all their weapons including AK's??. The reason I say this is cause some of the guys in the camp keep saying from time to time human weapons are ineffective?? I dont get it, I thought they found new bullet material, and not to mention that Tom blew half a mother ship with target seeking RPG (which doesnt exist in real life) other target locking weapons but not a RPG-7).Now the producers are trying to get you to think that the aliens are some killing machines (at one point Tom says that they can rip you apart with bare hands and....)  but I just cant get into the feeling anymore, cause producers already showed that you can kill the aliens with a knife, shoot their limbs off, kill them with high frequency sound, .... Just saying, it would have been better if they were actually body ripping/dismembmering aliens like the ones in the movie \"Alien\". Same thing with the \"Mecas\" the shows producers are trying to make you believe that there is pretty much nothing that the resistance can do to fight them, then how the hell did they just shoot the crap out of the 3 \"Mecs\" back at that school with Ak's??. I dont get it, are the AK's (with the new bullets) effective ? or not? whch one is it. And if the aliens are body ripping monsters, then how come in every hand to hand combat, every alien got killed by simply being stabbed in the mouth?? Not much of a alien soldier if you ask me..Also, one thing that absolutely annoys me with every alien invasion movie,( and I love alien invasion movies) how come they are supposed to be vastly more intelligent (millions of years ahead of us ) and yet they dont appear to be very good tacticians. If they are universe  conquerors would they have tactics and plans waaay more effective?? These aliens dont seem to be too smart, or capable. IMO the shows producers should have made them more mean (think \"Alien\") smart (you know they outsmart us almost every time) and should they have some kind of force field, of personal shields, they dont seem to be very advanced, besides the flying Toyota Priuses they got..."
B008BQG3RE I feel upon this show when scanning the tv channels. I watched one episode and liked it but needed to watch from the beginning. I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon Prime."
B008BQG3RE Season one was sort of hack but with season two it moves toward a more complicated and interesting story. Looking forward to seeing seasons three and how this story matures"
B008BQG3RE The battle with the aliens continue.  More introspect into the aliens desires and how the humans resist their efforts to survive.  More intrigue and new characters.The season ender was awesome with a new alien, but its yet to be determined if they are for or against the resistance."
B008BQG3RE Professor Tom Madison has been brought before one of the leaders of the alien invasion and discovers Karen one of his troops under his command as its speaker.  After a conversation for him and his fellow memebrs of the 2nd Mass to surrender and accept thier control of the Earth or die.  Tom chooses to fight and manages to escape the ship with the aid of a scarred red eyed skitter.While Tom is hundreds of miles away from the 2nd Mass Captain Weaver and the remains of the 2nd Mass must deal with a number of issues.  Pope's beserkers are getting out of control.  Food is running low.  Morale is at it lowest and with tom gone and no word from any kind of commanding officer Captain Weaver fears he and those under his command might be all that is left of hummantiy in the United States.The aliens have taken matters to new levels with new technologies and new ways of removing the remaining humans.  All the while a new rebellion has formed in the most unlinkley of places.  All this plus discoveries of what the Fish Heads are really doing on Earth and what there plans are for it.  The return of Tom's son into the fold of his family and what he discovers of what its like to be removed from a harness.  A messenger ending word that the goverment still functions of a sorts.  And something new landing on the planet that will change the war forever.  So tune in and check out season two of Falling Skies."
B008BQG3RE Just love this show and the thought and concept behind it.  You hav e to really wonder since we all truly know we are not the only living creatures in the massive universe."
B008BQG3RE A great show with constant twists. Acting is good special effects are good story telling is amazing. As a scifi show you may expect certain things but the story and the character development is great. A true dramatic action filled show"
B008BQG3RE very well done. the cgi was excellent. story paced well. cannot wait for the next season to begin this coming june."
B008BQG3RE Story gets better, the actors get better and I can't wait for Season 3 to become free for Prime Members!"
B008BQG3RE I really like this one, the special effects are amazing...I can't wait for season 3 to become available on Prime"
B008BQG3RE Just keeps improving over time! This season introduces more new alien masters and possible an ally or more ... while still showing the aliens have Superior intellect and technology. So its the under-dogs (humans) struggle to survive and eventually, take the fight to the aliens themselves."
B008BQG3RE Great show, one of the more interesting ones I've seen"
B008BQG3RE This series was okay but it seemed to lumber along like the monster robots that clunked and clanked their way across the screen in every episode."
B008BQG3RE Fun scifi drama with alien shooting.  I like Noah more in this than some other Library related mini-series. two words"
B008BQG3RE Just as I was getting to the last shows, the scenes kept shutting down.  But getting through that, the series was good."
B008BQG3RE Just as you think things are going to be ok, the plot takes a whole new turn and you are wondering how the writers are going to resolve the storyline - great season"
B008BQG3RE WELL WRITTEN, AND ACTED. For science fiction buffs pretty good however heros seemingly can do anything with little to no consequence. thats why i like the walking dead sometimes the stars get eaten"
B008BQG3RE A little more drama, a little less Pow-Pow!, but this was well placed. I am emotionally invested enough in the characters to care about them at this point, and this episode introduced some major plot twists/advances. I had been thinking the series was a bit corney but this one showed me that it was indeed working well.  :)"
B008BQG3RE Okay, I was in desperate need for a program to tide me over til the next season of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. Another customer very kindly suggested this to me. So happy he did! I can't believe I've ignored this on tv for so long, I've seen it advertised but just wasn't interested. As I wrote above, my bad. Season One was excellent as is the two that follow, obviously including this one. Now I'm having withdrawals waiting for season four which I'll have to admit, I will end up paying for as I can't wait until it's free with my Prime account. That's how good I find this show to be. That should tell you something when I can wait and get this free eventually but will pay to watch it sooner instead. As a matter of fact I can't wait for June 22nd! This show has everything, scary aliens, especially those intimidating 'Mech's', family story lines, romance, plenty of action, everything one would want from this type of show. I love all of the characters and they all work well and seamlessly together. It's a &#34;must have&#34; for my tv viewing!"
B008BQG3RE We watched season 1 and loved watching it (me and my husband) so we will watch all the seasons to follow, and hope there are more. This is not really a younger kids kind of show, seeing that part of the show is based on things that happen to them..."
B008BQG3RE This series just keeps getting better.  The characters are evolving and every show keeps me guessing as to what the aliens really want."
B008BQG3RE Classic TV Sci-fi with alien overtones and a mad max apocalyptic theme. I like it. The characters are lovable or hateable depending on whomever it is. I rate movies or tv series on whether I would buy them or not. I would not buy this but I cant wait for the 3rd season to get to the streaming stage."
B008BQG3RE Falling Skies is a well written show that keeps you coming back each week. Kind of soap opera meets science fiction."
B008BQG3RE This is an enjoyable series as long as you are OK with some logical inconsistencies.  The special effects,  action and acting are very good... the science, not so much."
B008BQG3RE The characters are complex and varied, the writing superb and the plot twists wonderful. I highly recommend scifi fans to check this series out!"
B008BQG3RE STEVEN SPIELBERG HIT the television world with a bang two seasons ago, producing \"Terra Nova,\" \"Smash,\" \"The River\" and \"Falling Skies.\" It was a shock when three of the four diverse shows were eventually cancelled. I mean, c'mon - this is Spielberg.But audiences loved TNT's science fiction gem \"Falling Skies\" about evil aliens invading and conquering Earth, and the interracial band of men and women who used guerrilla warfare and lots of heart to fight back.\"Falling Skies: Season One\" took us directly into the conflict months after the invasion. We only see the aliens from the human's viewpoint and those bad boys mean business. Cities have been destroyed, the population decimated and children have been captured and used as slave labor, rigged up with symbiotic harnesses that link them directly to the enemy. A hardy band of rebels - consisting of Capt. Dan Weaver (Will Patton), history professor Tom Mason (Noah Wylie in his best work since \"E.R.\") and his sons (Maxim Knight, Connor Jessup and Drew Roy), Doctor Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and biker renegade John Pope (Colin Cunningham) - link up, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, to take back the world.Will Wheaton hosts \"2nd Watch: Episode 20 `A More Perfect Union,'\" where a cast roundtable explores the struggles faced in Season Two. It's one of the lively features on the set. Wheaton tells us that John Rogers, co-creator of TNT's \"Leverage,\" said, \"They wrote themselves into such a corner at the end of the first season, and this entire season has just paid this off so well.\"Season Two \"had to be bigger, badder, had to move faster - Had to be cooler,\" executive producer Remi Aubuchon says in the feature, \"One Page at a Time: Writing the 2nd American Revolution.\"Even with all that enthusiasm Aubuchon was shocked to find no one had any plans to move past Tom walking into the alien spacecraft.Writers and producers finally asked the big question: What's the most interesting way to bring Tom back? We discover Tom has been held for months and tortured by the aliens. When he's allowed to escape and gets back to the rebel unit - the 2nd Massachusetts, named after the 1777 regiment of the Continental Army - Tom tells Capt. Weaver he can't trust himself. Have the aliens done something to him that would cause him to betray his people?That's one of the mysteries of Season Two. We also find out how Tom's sons and the rest of the 2nd Mass survived without him, where they are now, and where they hope to go. These 10 episodes uncover more answers and open more mysteries - a challenging opening to Season Three.The high-def visuals and immersive sound give Season Two the look of quality film. Extras provide a wealth of information. Short featurettes include \"Terry O'Quinn is Manchester,\" \"Team Skitter,\" and \"The Fans' Perspective: Touring the Set of `Falling Skies.'\" In \"Designing the Spaceship,\" co-executive producer/director Greg Beeman says Spielberg was \"very involved.\" \"They [the aliens] grow their computer system biologically. It's kind of a big nervous system,\" he tells us. Aubuchon credits Spielberg for \"Creating the Crawlies,\" another alien baddie, in that featurette. Apparently, when the studio questioned a design or effect, techs learned to say, \"Well, that's the way Stephen wants it.\" Enough said.Commentary on premier episode \"Worlds Apart\" with Wylie, Beeman and writer Mark Verheiden; \"Molon Labe,\" with Wyle, Aubuchon and writers Bradley Thompson and David Weddle; and season finale \"A More Perfect Union\" with Wylie, Aubuchon, and writers Thompson and Weddle are informative and good listening.Still, the best thing is the story - the battle of good versus evil.\"Things can only get worse, Tom, and none of us wants that to happen,\" alien puppet Karen Nadler (Jessy Schram) warns our Colonial-inspired fighters.Ha - bring it on, baby. We are ready for you!-- Kay Reynolds"
B008BQG3RE Season 2 stepped it up!  This show is letting people know it is going to stick around!  If you liked Season 1, Season 2 will not disappoint!"
B008BQG3RE Awsome best science fiction since Stargate SG1!Acting is very good!Always like science fiction!Would recommend to anyone.Larry Baker"
B008BQG3RE Having established ways to fight the alien invaders, the people of the Second Massachusetts militia and civilians make their way to what they believe is a new government (paradise) in Charleston, SC. As usual, things aren't all what they seem and new surprises await them, not the least being a whole new species of alien in the season closer. Our credulity gets stretched a bit at times (how many times will Pope show up, leave, show up again, switch from self-interest to being helpful?) b
B008BQG3RE Better than I expected but not good enough to hold my attention past one show. The plots for each show seem too predictable."
B008BQG3RE I loved the series and the packaging was great! I only purchase series I have seen and liked. If any one asks for  my imput I would recommend this  series. Lookling forward to season three"
B008BQG3RE I enjoy the turns the story has taken and I really hope next season won't turn into a poor scifi experience that just focuses on how many different aliens can be brought into the mix."
B008BQG3RE Gets you hooked-watched all of it and then lo and behold season 3 Amazon prime wants money for it! Sorry I watched it!"
B008BQG3RE Enjoyable story.  Action to satisfy the junkie.  Surprisingly good television .  The special effects at times seem a little cgi but the storyline makes one forget."
B008BQG3RE very much enjoyed the individuals and the moving dynamic of the aliens relationship with the humans. Understanding human relationships and need for each other."
B008BQG3RE I love this show, just wish the seasons were longer.  The characters are fun and realistic under the circumstances.  Great get away from the present."
B008BQG3RE Falling Skies is a great show with a lot of special effects too!  We are on the edge of our seats every episode we watch."
B008BQG3RE The perpetual good vs. evil scenario but this one really makes it so you want the human race to survive, or at least certain people in it anyway.  Many surprises in the plot line keep this series from being anywhere near predictable which is great.  Entertaining, engrossing and addictive: you just gotta know what is going to happen.  If this were a book I would call it a page turner."
B008BQG3RE After watching the last episode of Season One, I wasted no time loading Season Two- the actors are the characters.  The aliens are nerve wracking!"
B008BQG3RE this show really deserves 10 stars. Good story line, characters and special effects. Looking forward to season number four - yay!"
B008BQG3RE Great acting and the story line is very good. I would recommended this series to anyone who likes alien movies"
B008BQG3RE As good as the first season.  Holds your attention.  Great special effects.  Can't wait to see Season 3 when free."
B008BQG3RE One of the best TV made series. War of the world has been one of my favorite Si-Fi movies so this got me right off. I has just enough special effects great acting and great plot. I am watching  season 2 for a second time getting ready foe season 3's start."
B008BQG3RE Two seasons was more than enough for me. Nothing really changes -- new charactors, couple twists, etc in the next season but really -- it is what it is."
B008BQG3RE With so little of television actually being watchable, this show is a keeper!  Love the cast and the premise.  Noah Wylie is a stand out.  Interesting story, and just plain good TV."
B008BQG3RE good action movie for the entire Family. No Zombies but still as good can not wait to watch more epasodes."
B008BQG3RE Just a little more involved that series one.  Same people, more human reactions, different war mechanism.  Making friends with the enemy and using them as they use us."
B008BQG3RE Absolutely love this - A devout Falling Skies fan, it arrived on time and made my day!  The price was great and a &#34;must have&#34; for any fan of the Falling Skies series.  Definitely recommend!"
B008BQG3RE We have really been into this series, but the acting is rapidly deteorating. We end up laughing too often because of the over-the-top characters (Pope,Porter) and bad acting...lately any time Margaret or Karen is on screen we go into fits, those two are especially bad. Fantastic special effects and interesting storyline have kept us going so far."
B008BQG3RE Tom is having a hard time adjusting to life back with The 2nd Mass. He is afraid of what he might do as parts of his time with The Aliens are missing. Afraid of what he might do he begs to be tied up while the 2nd Mass moves.But when a Skitter and Mech attack threatens the group he steps up to fight. Pope seeing a chance to rid the group of a threat blows a bridge with Tom still on it.In the aftermath Hal attacks Pope looking for blood until Tom emerges from the river unscathed."
B008BQG3RE I was blown away with this series, hope there is more to come.  Great detail with the aliens. awesome would recommend to anyone."
B008BQG3RE Somehow very long winded in this whole thing while I get the dynamics its just not that good anymore and I will have to see Season 3 if I really wanna keep up"
B008BQG3RE The rebels discover that they have a new enemy, stronger and more intelligent.  The war heats up even as negotiation is attempted."
B008BQG3RE falling skies keeps you on edge constantly.  every episode is packed with what is going to happen next, it just keeps you riveted to you chair."
B008BQG3RE This has a good storyline, a great concept and good special effects.  I would recommend it to others and watch the third season"
B008BQG3RE Enjoy the new take on storytelling. There are no flashbacks just events in real time. There are no secrets, you learn of big events at the same time the characters do. Makes for very straightforward and honest storytelling"
B008BQG3RE Simply amazing. The action picked up quickly, once the first season left things set up and ready to explode. Packed with action and interesting twists, I can say I am efficiently hooked to this series."
B008BQG3RE I'm so hooked on every episode of Falling Skies and I just finished all the Season and I wish that there was more!  Very good story line and lots of action and great acting."
B008BQG3RE I started watching on t.v. & it is just my kind of show. Not having cable or satellite service any longer...I am able to watch on here. Catching up and will watch all that is offered."
B008BQG3RE Great story line and continuity from episode to episode.  Falling skies should be around for many more seasons.  Have been a fan of Noah Wyle since his ER days and the Libranian episodes."
B008BQG3RE As a big fan of science fiction, I was hooked on Falling Skies from the first episode, Season 1. I have not been disappointed yet, even with the many twists and turns of the story line. With the exception of the aliens and the near destruction of all human life on Earth (big exceptions, I agree) this is an engaging story of the bonds of families, current and families to be."
B008BQG3RE Good old alien invasion idea done with an original spin I've never seen or thought of. Seeing something with twists and turns makes it that much more enjoyable."
B008BQG3RE As a retired science teacher, and a long time science fiction reader and watcher from the time of Ray Bradbury and Issac Asimov and other class-act science-fiction writers including H.G. Wells I find some of the sci-fi shows today sadly lacking in credibility. A good example is Season 2 Episode 7. The 2nd Mass is getting ready to leave for Charleston when their hospital base is attacked by the aliens. Although they sorely need fuel for transport they use up most of the fuel to light up the whole hospital with emergency generators although only a few areas need lighting, and the chance of getting more fuel in doubt. While all of the lights are on the kerosine and battery powered lanterns are left on and burning thus using up those resources. On the way out of the hospital, instead of going to the nearest freeway or at least major paved road, the whole convoy is headed down a one lane dirt road running through what seems to be a primitive camping area. The road appears to be losing it's bottom due to melting snow, and if any of the vehicles get stuck the whole convoy is trapped. These are situations involving lack of common sense and increases the chance of defeat for the Fighting Second Massachusetts. A good example of incredible science, in the science portion of the show, is where the doctor and several others are trapped when a new menace, some sort of creepy-crawlies who can chew trough metal are in the process of gaining access to those trapped by gnawing on a metal door. The doctor has one of her aides scurry around to get an oxygen tank. The purpose of the tank is to use it to create a flame thrower to incinerate the little buggers. As a doctor supposedly well versed in chemistry she should know that oxygen supports combustion but will not burn by itself. Using only the oxygen from the tank she creates a flame large enough to do the intended job, when in fact this is a chemical impossibility. All in all this is a fun type program not to be taken seriously and suitable for watching in the early hours of the A.M. when one can't sleep like this writer who is watching the program and writing this review at 5:30 A.M.on a Thursday morning."
B008BQG3RE It is a good sci-fi story, the acting in good, and it is easy to get caught up in the story."
B008BQG3RE I feel like the show is good in some episodes and bad in others. Sometimes I feel like it is trying to hard to make a particular point and gets bogged down, other times it can be crisp, sharp and dead on. My interest has grown more as the show has progressed and was greatly disappointed when I learned the 3rd season was not on Amazon Prime. Hopefully it will show up there soon."
B008BQG3RE Alot of fun and very engaging to watch. Noah Wylie is the perfect lead and he makes you forget he's the guy from ER. I own it and i've watched it several times."
B008BQG3RE I can not stop watching this series.  PRIME has paid for itself already.  Almost through witht the second series.  This series is so suspenseful.  I recommend this series."
B008BQG3RE I was so happy to get both 1st and 2nd season of Falling Skies.  Yes the 2nd season was better than the 1st in that the team has found a way to defeat the aliens.  Now I want to get the 3nd season as soon as it is published.."
B008BQG3RE Falling Skies Season 2 at Amazon is as good as the first season and carries on in the same story.  The acting was excellent for those of us who enjoy the sci-fi drama action adventure series.  I say in my humble opinion that the show is well worth the watch."
B008BQG3RE sci fi end of the earth at it's best. The first season was kick butt and I know you'll love the second just as I will."
B008BQG3RE Considering it is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, this show is actually fun to watch, especially the characters. I am currenlty watching season 3."
B008BQG3RE Watched this when it was on standard prime time TV. Always wondered what happened to it and waited for it to come back. I guess it went to cable which I don't have. So glad the story continued to a second season. Haven't finished watching it yet so don't know if this is the end. What a great alien movie. I like all movies of this type. Most are stupid but this one has a great &#34;family&#34; story behind it. It's really more about that than the focus being on the aliens themselves. I still wish Hollywood would stop making aliens that look like bugs and robots though. Noah Wylie is great as are the kids and other cast members. Acting against a green screen can be difficult but they do a good job. Yay once again to Steven Spielberg."
B008BQG3RE Very good series. Always liked Noah Wyle but also has a great cast of supporting stars. Exciting action with interesting aliens."
B008BQG3RE This is a wonderful series with lots of action! TNT has a winner with this show. I always enjoy watching it!"
B008BQG3RE Well written and acted.  Noah Wiley is exceptional in this as are the other actors. Story is believable and could happen that way,"
B008BQG3RE Good story. Plenty of action. Family ties.  Not draggy. New look for aliens .different from the norm. Good for syfi lovers"
B008BQG3RE there is another show that seems a lot like this show that has already been out there . it had a space ship like a aircraft carrier."
B008BQG3RE Often laughable TNT fantasy series.  This is definitely NOT SciFi, as what little \"science\" there is falls into the grade school shop class category.  That being said, this series has considerable entertainment value due to the nifty space aliens and the engaging story line.  The dialogue is unbelievably cheesy, bordering at times on high camp, made all the more hilarious because it is clearly unintentional.  I spend a great deal of time wondering how the actors manage to keep a straight face.  It bears the unmistakable stamp of Mr. Spielberg, the same man who utterly destroyed the brilliant AI with his schmaltzy tacked-on ending.  The talented Mr. Spielberg, who clearly saw one too many episodes of \"Lassie\" as an impressionable lad, cannot seem to restrain himself from imbuing this series with a 1950s retro Mom-and-apple-pie sensibility.  There are so many scenes clotted with overwrought emotions that I had to check to make sure I wasn't watching the Lifetime movie of the week replete with Skitters and Mechs.  Even in the thick of fierce, blood-spattered guerilla warfare, these people manage to work in group hugs.  They must be black and blue from all the manly back-thumping.  What's next, interpretative dance?  Perhaps an IV line attached to a bag of insulin would counteract the more cringeworthy forays into the uber-maudlin.  However, this hot, steaming mess of a series has me hooked.  I can't wait to see season 3 when I am able to cough up the bucks to buy it.  We all need somebody to root for and I am no exception.  I am soundly on the side of the Overlords and I am counting on them to nip it in the bud whenever one of these oh-so-tedious humans utters another line of Hallmark card drivel.  Think of it as euthanasia.  Go Overlords!"
B008BQG3RE The first two seasons of Falling Skies was awesome. It has cool aliens, 'Walking Dead' type survival themes and great character development. After just a few episodes I was totally invested in the characters (my favorite being Pope) and lot's of lessons surrounding 'democracy', community and never giving up your gun rights (lol).  Anyway I cannot wait for season 3, which beings in July, as season 2 left us with a lot of questions given its cliff hanger.  And for all those nitpicking about inconsistency details, relax folks. Its just a tv show."
B008BQG3RE Long time science fiction fan and this isa good show. Noah Wyle does a great job. Not as good as the Battle Star Galactica remake but better than most."
B008BQG3RE This show is so awesome!!  It's intelligent, imaginative and exciting.  Great actors and pretty good graphics for a TV show.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would."
B008BQG3RE I started watching from listening to a lady he said she liked &#34;Falling Skies&#34;.The characters are well defined and you care about what's going on.The aliens depicted in this series are not all bad. I truly like this.I gave it 5 stars because I loved it."
B008BQG3RE I truly enjoyed this show. Honestly speaking, I finished Season 1 and 2 within a few days after I started to watch. For a few mornings, my wife asked me why my eyes were red!"
B008BQG3RE All around the people and the kids, even how the aliens started going after the over lords, it will be something more, I want to see season 3"
B008BQG3RE This is well done, and well acted.  Some of it is standard network fare but watching it without commercials improves it considerably.  I'm looking forward to the next season."
B008BQG3RE This is what a Recap is suppose to be about, to Re-Capture the events of a program and accurately present them in a fashion that someone that has not seen the full episodes would be thus caught completely up on the happenings of that program. In military and law enforcement it is a called a debrief.The debrief tells those what you know without them having to be there in a way for them to make calculated decisions on what you have told them.This Recap does precisely that. 10+++"
B008BQG3RE I still like the show but big surprise the Asian dude dies.  Also the little African American kid comes back for a hot ten min and then gets dusted.  So right now we are down to one African American soldier who has been badly burned, and two doctors, one Mexican and the other Eurasian I think.  A whole bunch of new characters show up (all white of course) to defend the earth against aliens.  The only excuse I can think up for this is that it takes place in from South Carolina to New England.  Oh wait there is the tri states aria which has a super rich cultural background.  It is not that I don't like white people.  I am married to one but really I am so sick of shows with all white people, especially shows like this where it does not make sense.  Unless the aliens were specifically targeting people of color first when they invaded.  Maybe they did.  Maybe the skitters had a device that detected sunblock and killed every living thing not using it before those who did.  Why would the aliens do this?  Who knows.I love the new alien.  I love that the alien stuff is complicated.  I love how people are disorganized and how characters change and grow.  I do think that at some time people should realize that Tom Mason puts his family above the human race and maybe is a crappy leader for it.  That part I don't buy.Many of the characters I do like and have some depth but many do not.  In no way do I blame any of the actors for this.  They get the lines they get and do the best they can with them.  That being said.  Tom Mason is boring, Hal Mason is really boring, Matt Mason is great, Anne Glass deserves someone less boring, Lourdes is great and lost a character who I really liked, Dai died, I love Captain Weaver.  I even like the guy from Max Headroom.  I like John Pope, Margret, Ben Mason I just wish there were more non white people in the cast.  Like no New Yorkers made it out?  No one from New Jersey.  In my dream of dreams the cast gets captured and brought to a facility in NYC and are saved by a gorilla warfare team made up of criminals, cops, and random people who live in the abandoned railways of New York.  They could meet an ex policeman played by Lawrence Mason, Maybe a smuggler played by Yunjin Kim and maybe an ex CIA Air marshal played by Naveen Andrews.  I know this will never happen and that more non white characters will die and more white people will show up.  I know Anthony will die in season three.  All he has to do is say hello to Captain Weaver's daughter."
B008BQG3RE A+  - excellent sf story.  Good characterization and relatonships.  Good story that keeps getting more and more involved.  I liked it."
B008BQG3RE The mix of action and drama is tasty and delicious. I like how they handled the Professor and the Doctor (finally) getting together, while respecting the lives they had before the invasion. I'm proud of Ben for striking out on his own. He is right, this is a new kind of world, and 15 is plenty grown up. \"He's a (typical) teenager who wants to change the world.\""
B008BQG3RE THIS SHOW IS THE BEST!  Easily one of my favorite shows on TV right now.  The cast is stunning and the story is perfect!  I love all the twists and turns.  Season 3 is off to an amazing start as well!  I highly recommend this to anyone!"
B008BQG3RE This is one of the best shows on now. Great human interest stories mixed with sci-fi. It is a must-see!"
B008BQG3RE Cannot wait for next season.... this is going to be remembered as a classic.  Good acting, storyline inventive and I just love it when a sci fi changes the way we fear aliens.  Great story, I've watched it twice now"
B008BQG3RE I thought this was a very well written sci fi series.  I don't normally watch sci fy but this one kept my interest."
B008BQG3RE I don't have cable, so I purchased this show on Amazon, and it was worth every penny. There are so many really good characters, and the plot is fast-paced and full of excitement. Noah Wyle and the rest of the actors are very good in their roles."
B008BQG3RE I just love this series - I cannot get enough of it - thank you Steven Spielberg very much for this wonderful series."
B008BQG3RE Lost track of the show.  What small amount of the show I watched was pretty good.I need to look at this on Netflix for free."
B008BQG3RE Love the way this series draws you deeper into the world of the characters and stays fresh by always adding new elements and surprises."
B008BQG3RE Very good Sci-Fi, in the tradition of War of the Worlds. Can't wait for season three. Noah Wylie is believable as the college professor."
B008BQG3RE I absolutely love this show and can't enough. I got it for free on Prime. However, I'm on to your dirty little trick Amazon. They give you the first 2 seasons for free and make you pay for the third."
B008BQG3RE Loved season 2.  I want more and I want it right now.  I don't want to wait.  It''s that good."
B008BQG3RE Each episode advanced the story well, held the tension of such hard times, gave some relief to the unremiting struggle, and I enjoyed it greatly."
B008BQG3RE What continues to amaze me about &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is how much story and character development can be accomplished in just 10 episodes per season.  Whereas the &#34;old format&#34; of TV shows was to produce 20-25 episodes per season, the &#34;new format&#34; is to only see about 10-13...but completely cut out the &#34;filler&#34;!  In the case of &#34;Falling Skies&#34;, the creators of this show have made pacing an art form.  In &#34;just&#34; the 10 episodes included in this set, it seems like an entire season (or more!) has transpired.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilers ahead), when Season One of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; signed off, Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) had boarded an alien spacecraft with a &#34;fish-head&#34;.  His experiences (and, most importantly, repercussions of those experiences) comprise a large portion of this season.  Another main plot point: General Weaver (Will Patton) learns of a potential alien resistance in Charleston.  Should he lead the 2nd Mass there, or is it just a fantasy?  Also this season, Ben Mason (Connor Jessup) takes on a much larger role, as his history with being harnessed makes him an important cog in a potential alien revolution from within.Basically, this second season of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is just as good as the first, if not maybe a bit better (although they are both five-star efforts).  The action is still vibrant, the plots move along at a brisk pace, and the characters continue to develop even though they are &#34;household names&#34; now.  I will be starting Season Three as soon as I have the opportunity!"
B008BQG3RE Lots of fun, sexy and suspenseful.  The only issue is the season episodes are far and few.  Is it a budget thing or..."
B008CPB5K4 I expected a decent film, given that it starred Martin Sheen, but Stella Days is a period piece with more depth and story than I even imagined! Having a priest wanting to buck the system back in the 1950s is unique, but Sheen pulls it off with a character that will have you rooting for his originality and constant frustration with the religious system. And Stephen Rea, as Sheen's nemesis, is the guy you will love to hate. I highly recommend \"Stella Days\" to all adult audiences."
B008CPB5K4 Martin Sheen presents Excellent acting as he plays a Priest who loves movies. His Inspiration takes him to different levels of drama as he contemplates on opening a Cinema in an Irish village. However, he is confronted with struggle and challenges as he faces the opinion of the church and the townspeople. His sole purpose is to raise money for the church. This film portrays passion, emotion, and inspiration. Very Entertaining and Enjoyable from start to finish. Highly Recommended!"
B008CPB5K4 Martin Sheen has landed a role that shows off his considerable talents in this small scale, sensitive and informed film from Tribeca.  Based on a novel by Michael Doorley adapted for the screen by Antoine O. Flatharta and directed with sensitivity by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, the story takes place in Ireland of 1956, and the film opens with an introduction to bringing electricity into a very small town whose people have done very well without the new-fangled things, thank you very much.The priest of the town is Fr. Daniel Barry (Martin Sheen), a loving man who hears confessions, makes his rounds offering oils of last rites to please one elderly ill patient and caring for his flock in a very human manner, is a man of the World having the Church both in America and Rome, who has a passion for Cinema , Music and Language is left to languish in a rural community after being replaced in Rome by a younger priest with greater credentials for scholarship.  The Parish Bishop (Tom Hickey) has decided his parish needs a new, modern, concrete church and he burdens the parish priests to raise the funds for the project. There is a politician in the town - Brendan (Stephen Rea) - who vies for power with Fr. Barry, seeking political clout to reign in the filthy temptations of the world from his followers.  Fr. Barry, on the other hand, devises a method for raising funds (and catering to his love for picture shows) by building a cinema. He is supported by a new young schoolteacher Tim (Trystan Gravelle, a young Welsh actor of great potential) - Fr. Barry overrode Brendan, further alienating himself.  Tim finds room and board with a local young mother Elaine (Amy Huberman) whose alcoholic abusive husband is off to London leaving their young son Joey (Joseph O'Sllivan) without the nurturing of a father.  The tale pits the worldly priest against the power hungry fundamentalist politicians and the significant people of the story are at first injured and then find a manner of redemption.  In the end the `bringing of light' to the little town in Tipperary via electricity and modern times merely reveals a path for conscientious folk to escape it all.The cast is very strong, the musical score by Nicholas Hooper, and the countryside of Ireland is gorgeous.  This is a little film with a big message that flies like a lark in the sky.  Try to catch it!  Grady Harp, June 12"
B008CPB5K4 The well-intentioned period drama \"Stella Days\" is a small and quiet movie that has relatively modest goals.  So if you're not expecting epic movie making on a grand scale, there are simpler pleasures to be had in this introspective film directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan.  T
B008CPB5K4 This is another of what are often called \"small films\" - often by independent production companies but, as in this case, produced under the auspices (and funding) of a national film board (of which there is none in the US). \"Stella Days\" (the title refers to the name of the movie \"venue\"  - THE STELLA - I won't call it a \"theater\" - that Martin Sheen , as a priest, wants to open in a small Irish village in 1956.) was produced by the Irish National Film Board (with some participation from Norway, if I remember in the opening credits.) Much of the cast is Irish though the American stars are Martin Sheen and Stephen Rea.). Sheen's accent is not as strong as the others and some of this is excused by giving his character a plot device where he lived in the US for 18 years, thus softening it.I'll defer to the other reviewers here to give you more of the plot - though I watched this DVD with no advance preparation or knowledge - except to think, from the packaging, that it would be similar to 1988's \"Cinema Paradso\" (it isn't).  I enjoyed the film - as I like \"small films\" but thought it could have used some tighter editing (it still only runs 90 minutes). The \"side story\" of electricity just coming to homes in Ireland as late as 1956 was interesting but only tangential to the plot. What really surprised me was how the filmmakers approached the \"money-tizing\" of the Catholic Church. \"Bigger churches are better\", \"We need to raise building funds for a new church even though the old one is perfectly fine\" and how the church gets involved in politics. I'm not a Catholic and wonder how a religious Catholic would view this angle which is prominent in the film.I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't put high on my \"must see\" list.The DVdhas only one bonus: A three-minute \"behind the scenes\" featurette, which spends nearly the first minute with scenes from the film itself.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B008CS6WJK Probably my favorite season due to some of the episodes in this season that I felt like touched based more on certain characters past. Overall I love all of the seasons cause this show is great."
B008CS6WJK the show you just have to let go and have fun---hope it stays fresh--so jump in and have a blast"
B008CS6WJK Lumpy Space Princess and her memoirs. Ice King and missing princess body parts. Marceline and the Nightosphere. BMO goes film noir. And creepy Lemongrab sleep peeps. You must meet these characters and laugh."
B008CS6WJK this is a great cartoon series one the best that cartoon network has had on in a long time I love it if your a fan of cartoons you will prolly like it too check it out"
B008CS6WJK This show isn't just for kids; anyone can enjoy it! It's hilarious and often times non sequitur. Great story lines in this season particularly."
B008CS6WJK Adventure Time!  This season adds more depth to the already wonderful characters as well as some great twists to the plot."
B008DGRDZ8 this was informative and a great idea for a movie, and there's a lot of good content that takes you into the world of alternative games and their creation.  unfortunately, the breadth of the picture feels too shallow after awhile, and it turns more into a psychological profile of the few designers they choose to follow, dealing with their anxieties and fears.  unfortunately, it becomes less about the games, the business, and the development process and more about geek phobias and personal storylines."
B008DGRDZ8 I should first mention that I do like some indie games, primarily \"Journey\", \"Limbo\", \"Alien Hominid\", and \"Castle Crashers\". Unfortunately, nobody who worked on any of those games is in this documentary.It was hard for me to find a person in this movie with whom I could empathize. The one guy who had redeeming qualities was the developer who was working on \"Super Meat Boy\", and he seemed to be genuinely grateful for the opportunity to pursue his life's passion of creating a game. He was the ONLY person in the movie who was happy at any time... the others were consumed by narcissism, intolerance, insecurity, delusions of paranoia, and delusions of grandeur. They were determined to project an image of being miserable, no matter what happened. At first, they claimed misery due to the lack of opportunities that were made available to their vision. Then, once they were given that (enormous) opportunity by Microsoft (for the Xbox platform), they proceeded to complain about how bad they had it, because the work required was difficult and time consuming (???). I'm dead serious; this is in the documentary- repeatedly.They would also go out of their way to bash the big guys (like Microsoft, who gave them their shot!) for lacking their artistic vision. They would level vehement criticism at the big guys for making games that were popular, and which other gamers like. This level of intolerance was incredibly offensive. Not only are they setting world records for hypocrisy, but they are promoting the ill-conceived concept that only those who like the SAME games they like are \"correct\". This is like claiming that there should be only one genre of film or book, or that there should only be one movie director and one book author in the world. The reason that there are different types of games is the same reason why there are different choices in books, movies, cars, clothing, etc... different people like different things! They fail to realize that if all games followed their own patterns and style, they would actually be mainstream, thereby embodying the very thing they claim to loathe.There is one particularly distressing sequence where the developer of \"Fez\" expresses his passionate desire to murder his former business partner (what's wrong with this guy?). Based on his intensity and repetition, it's hard to argue that he's just kidding, especially since they have opposing business interests at this point. He then goes on to scream at some poor convention employee (who has nothing to do with the problem at hand), because his game keeps crashing (because of a bug that he accidentally programmed into it, he admits). Again, I wouldn't have believed it, if it wasn't caught on tape.Most mind boggling of all, these guys go on to complain (profusely) when their games actually get published, make great sales, and receive glowing reviews. Again, I'm not making this up. They're completely determined to project an aura of misery and \"tortured artist\", no matter the opportunities and recognition they receive. Sure, they got great reviews, but \"not for the right reasons\", claims one developer. Again, people aren't robots, sir... everybody is going to interpret a piece of media in a completely unique, subjective manner. To suggest that everybody should only be playing your game, and then perceive it an identical fashion, is so narcissistic, it simply beggars the mind. Another developer, who was whining for sales and exposure previously, proceeds to complain when his game sells thousands of copies on the first day, distressed that he has to \"share\" his game with others (the exact opportunity he was clamoring for, mind you). If it wasn't caught on film, I wouldn't have believed that these reactions could possibly be true.Technically speaking, the documentary is well filmed, though I'm not sure what the filmmaker was going for here. I would imagine he had no idea what he was walking into."
B008DGRDZ8 A lot of people including me start on something and give up when we don't see immediate results. The characters in this documentaries are also human but they have a fear of the unknown and a deep rooted fear of rejection. They want to project their understanding of the world into a game form. They feel it is all they know, they are socially awkward, smile too much, some smile too less. The editing is fantastic, I'm sure they took more interviews and had more material but to jot this entire thing down in just 100 minutes and making it so incredibly fascinating was quite a worthwhile viewing.Secondly, this film is good because it doesn't exactly take you into the intricacies of gaming, it takes you into what it feels like to know you may be successful if you do so and so, yet doing it. One of the interviewed folk says, &#34;I Would kill myself than work for Epic or EA. Modern Warfare and Halo 3 are some of the worst games ever created.&#34; That right there is very derogatory to most gamers but they say it anyway and you know what? Their conviction makes you want to believe them.The key point of the term Indie Game is that most video games involve 1000 people working on them and a period of a year unto five. Imagine just having two people work on the entire design. You end up being richer than those 1000 people together or individually would ever get and also you attention to detail, your idea to reality resonance must be spectacular... INDIE GAME is a great film. It will not make you laugh, it will not make you go WOW in awe but it will make you smile a smile of understanding we men smile when know someone's life and soul is put into a project.Also they are so much like artists, they aren't even happy when they are successful because they are so unaware of the reality of money and society at large.I'm just going on and on about the film.+ Excellent editing+ Likeable Gamers+ Moving enough to be inspiringThis is such a good film it made me think I should probably watch more documentaries. Please leave recommendations."
B008DGRDZ8 Indie Game: The Movie is a documentary that follows the independent developers of Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Fez. Although we do witness the developing process, we also delve into the minds of these developers and understand the struggles and sacrifices that occur to follow their dreams. Indie Game: The Movie is a deep and interesting look into the independent game industry.This documentary focuses on indie games, and the developing process. It is deep and detailed, as it shows the struggles and concerns these developers go through; if they aren't successful, however they measure it, was it worth it? The documentary stays focused throughout and balances the different developers screen time well enough (although I believe Jonathan Blow did receive the least.) Everything about this documentary is interesting; from Fez's appearance at PAX to Super Meat Boy's actual release. The music was also great throughout the documentary, it felt very enchanting.Overall, Indie Game: The Movie is an intriguing and motivational documentary; an interesting journey, whether you watch this because you like video games or not. As of 1/12/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and a purchase/rental is highly recommended."
B008DGRDZ8 It amazes me that smart people would choose to speak as these do.  I hope people realize the whole industry is not this bad.  Great psychological insights concerning what drives idie game creators."
B008DGRDZ8 \"Indie Game: The Movie\" may be as famous for its non-traditional distribution, the intricacies of which filmmakers James Swirsky and Lisanne Pajot shared with their viewing public, as for its subjects. But its subjects are stars in their own right, all successful independent game developers of very recognizable computer games. The film focuses on Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes, the creators of \"Super Meat Boy\", Phil Fish, the creator of \"FEZ\", and Jonathan Blow, creator of \"Braid\". The film lays bare the emotional and social aspects of designing games outside the mainstream but says little about the industry, economics, or the craft of making a concept into a game.The events of the film took place in 2010, when \"Super Meat Boy\" went on sale and \"FEZ\" made its debut at the PAX game conference while still in development. The film follows Edmund McMillan, Tommy Refenes, and Phil Fish from the stress of finishing their games, to the anticipation and anxiety brought about by the release, and a little bit of the aftermath. Jonathan Blow is the most articulate of the developers and is very frank about the emotional investment that he makes in the games he creates and the consequences when they are finally released to the public. All three men describe the inspirations and ideas behind their games, which invariably came from childhood.What \"Indie Game\" does, it does well. It provides a window into the minds of some very introverted, pessimistic, insecure, and talented game developers. But it's a one-trick pony. I came to this film knowing next to nothing about computer games. But these games interested me. I wondered how one goes about conceiving a game so complex. But the film says nothing about the conception of game structure, only of vague themes. I also wondered how this all works economically. There is talk in the film that the developers will strike it rich if their games are popular. While selling a million copies might provide them with a good income, wealth seem unlikely.It seems like half of a film. Some of the expressions of angst on the part of the developers could have been cut to make room for more information about the role of independent developers in the industry and to better explain how a game is designed. I'm sure some members of the audience will be put off by these developers' emotional attachment to their creations, their fear of being misunderstood, their displeasure when their games are not perceived as they intended, etc. As a reviewer with some experience of the publishing industry, I can tell you that their comments are interchangeable with those of the average novelist. Whiny, yes, but heartfelt. Creative people are like that."
B008DGRDZ8 There have been years where film, music, art, television, and video games have been controlled by a tiny handful of people and they become stale commercial products.  But sooner or later, the maverick breaks through and finds a new way to get his creativity out to the public.  The people with the most passion, talent, and work ethic somehow beat the odds and find their audience.  Though I own a PS3, I am now convinced that the game console war should end and gamers should start directly downloading the most fun and visually different products straight from the developer to their computers.  Microsoft and Sony are obviously scratching and clawing to keep anyone else from making a nickel."
B008DGRDZ8 Indie Game: The Movie (Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky, 2012)This is one of those vertical-market documentaries, I think. I'm not entirely sure how fascinating it would be for people who aren't gamers, but as someone who owns two-thirds of the games profiled here and finds them immensely enjoyable, I thought it was a wonderful thing indeed.Indie Game: The Movie chronicles the development (partially) and the release (partially) of three games made by very small development teams: two people worked on Super Meat Boy, while Braid and Fez were each the creation of a single person. The actual development cycle, or the most complete piece of it we get, focuses on Super Meat Boy; Braid had already been released by the time the film started shooting (and was at the time one of the most successful indie games ever made), while Fez was still in development by the time shooting wrapped. (Spoiler alert: Fez, after five years of development, did finally get released in April of 2012 to near-universal acclaim.) Much of the film consists of interviews with the developers, who document the struggle, both financially and emotionally, of undertaking a massive project like the creation of a videogame on such a small scale.Most documentaries of this sort that I've seen recently have been of the \"hey, let's play up the quirkiness of the people we're interviewing!\" stripe. Indie Game: The Movie doesn't do that, and it's a refreshing change of pace--it aims to show us that these folks are just like everyone else, if perhaps a bit more obsessive in their obsessions. Because of that, I think it's easier for the average viewer, gamer or no, to identify with these guys and their plight. When Phil Fish, the creator of Fez, blows up at his former business partner, you feel it. That's not something you can get from the look-at-the-freaks documentaries.This is very good stuff indeed. I'm not sure if you'll \"get it\" if you're not a gamer, but it's certainly worth a try; this is as compelling as any documentary I've seen in the past year. ****"
B008DIY9T4 I enjoyed this documentary and I was not a Johnny Carson fan.  I grew up with Johnny Carson but I was not a regular viewer.  When I watched Johnny Carson, it was basically for the younger (my) generation of comedians.  I learned he was born the same year as my father and he started in TV when TV was beginning.  I always thought he was younger than Dad and came along after TV started.  His show, his personality, his standards and his values remained constant over time.  It was a show that was truly American and truly TV and he did it all pretty much live.  He had many accomplishments, was very generous to his guests and to the community, enjoyed life and left a long lasting legacy to American pop culture. Truly a remarkable man."
B008DIY9T4 Johnny was an odd man . I used to watch him all the time. I guess I never realized that he was so sad in his private life. I truly believe that he needed his mother's love and attention. Clearly he never got it when she was alive. Only in death and the contents on the vox with the clippings....... I think she was too late to help her son."
B008DIY9T4 Refreshingly honest. Respected his audience.  Didn't buy into the Hollywood mind speak.  We will miss hearing Ed say - Here's Johnny!"
B008DIY9T4 Those who grew up watching Johnny Carson will enjoy this the most. Its been 20 years since he was last on the air, and it brought back a lot of memories for me from the 80's and early 90's when I was growing up and my parents watched The Tonight Show nearly every night.Johnny was obviously not a perfect person, but his style of entertainment was so successful, most of us that watched him perform live will always be able to reminisce and realize that somehow the show became an important part of our lives, even if we didn't know it at the time. No matter how bad your day was, you knew you were going to come home, turn on the tv, and laugh. My parents have since passed away, but even something as simple as The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was a large part of my life growing up, and I found watching this was both sad because its been so long since he was on the air and people like my parents were still around, and it also made me smile because I have so many memories from watching the show many evenings.People like Jay Leno and David Letterman have been extremely successful with their own shows and styles, but nothing will ever replace Johnny, and I feel bad that those who were born after he went off the air will never really know him or The Tonight Show. Overall this American Masters episode did a good job of giving us a small look into the imperfect life of someone that was part of many of our lives for years, and it brings back the memories once again."
B008DIY9T4 These were the highlights of this one for me:1. Details of Carson's early life and the experiences that may have motivated him to host a television show. There is evidence his need for approval may have come from a mother whose approval he sought - but never quite felt he received. There is also a fascinating timeline of Carson's first television shows, not all of them successful. He was, of course, in the right place at the right time and able to take advantage of television's first days.2. Interviews with other comedians as well as those connected to the Tonight Show (Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen). It was both interesting and touching to hear the admiration and awe from people like Dave Letterman, Jay Leno, Ellen DeGeneres, and so many others who credited Carson with paving the way for them - as well as being the benchmark for excellence.3. Clips from the Tonight show as well as other programs featuring Carson. I did wish some of the clips were longer or showed the full segment, including a hilarious one where Carson is surprised by a baby orangutan and another where Doc Severinsen discusses Thanksgiving plans with Carson. Both deserved to be seen in their entirety, instead of as excerpts. So I'm deducting a star for that.Both diehard Carson fans and those who want to know more about him should find this worth watching."
B008DIY9T4 The great Johnny Carson is, of course, the perfect subject to be profiled in PBS's long-running \"American Masters\" series. An intensely private person, perhaps it was fitting and respectful that they waited a full seven years after his death before putting together this pretty comprehensive biography. Carson, to me, was always an extremely complicated and enigmatic man. He was uncomfortable disclosing the personal side of his life, and yet somehow managed to create a TV persona that you welcomed into your home on a nightly basis. He was a comfort, a friend, a routine. He changed the landscape of television talk shows, was (and is) beloved by the industry and the public, but was always wary of revealing his true self. It's a complicated dichotomy, and one that this profile attacks head-on. Having seen so many of the \"American Masters\" series, this may well be one of my favorites.\"King of Late Night\" works on a number of different levels. It spends, obviously, a great deal of time revolving around \"The Tonight Show\" which makes sense since Carson hosted the program for over 30 years. In a world where the TV audience was not as fragmented as it is today, Carson was a late night staple for the masses. For nostalgia factor alone, \"King of Late Night\" is wildly entertaining for its wide array of clips from that program. Carson had both an urban wit and a boyish charm which was, in my opinion, a large part of his appeal. When he was on, he was on! And this program shows him at his best, as the consummate host. The documentary looks at some of the more heartfelt and sentimental segments from the show, but doesn't skimp on laughs. Of course, \"The Tonight Show\" was known for fostering comedic talent and many who got a boost from the show are on hand to extol Carson's virtues including Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin, Ellen DeGeneres, Ray Romano, David Steinberg, Drew Carey, Garry Shandling, and Conan O'Brien. Seriously, I'm only scratching the surface with this list, but there is a veritable who's who of entertainment bigwigs offering comment in \"King of Late Night.\"Despite the professional polish, however, there always seemed to be something a bit darker behind the veneer. Better than anything I've seen, \"King of Late Night\" tries to understand the man. He was somewhat of a recluse, had a very public series of failed marriages, and a distant relationship with his mother. This is NOT some sort of expose, though, seeking to uncover unpleasantness. It really is just trying to get to the heart of what made Carson so effective, so accessible, so successful. This is a biographical portrait with a good mix of personal and professional and, as a consequence, I feel like I know him better than ever before. If you are a Carson fan, this is essential viewing--but I really recommend it for anyone interested in entertainment or television. Carson was, is, and always will be a trailblazer and a giant in the field. KGHarris, 5/12."
B008DIY9T4 If you ever watched Johnny Carson, be sure to watch this.  The two hours show life time background and lifetime highlights.Well worth viewing"
B008DIY9T4 Thoroughly enjoyed watching this, answer were big fans oh his and The Tonight Show. There were no problems with the streaming, either video or audio."
B008DIY9T4 Johnny Carson is the icon for late night entertainment. But this is more than a tribute to the performer, it's a testament to the man. He tells his story in his own words and actions and admits that he is not only flawed as a man, a father, but knows his flaws and limitations as such. This is a candid and revealing story that dates back to his childhood and his own parents shortcomings which naturally he past on to his children. A well meaning individual who excelled at everything in his business, but failed as a father, and a husband. A wonderful and engagingly honest look at the king of late night."
B008DIY9T4 Johnny Carson is iconic.  Since he was born in my home State & grew up in Nebraska his personal life wasn't such a surprise to me.  He was just a &#34;good old boy&#34; that made it big.  That always comes with a price."
B008DR2ACI I just found out FX has agreed to a Season 3 of WILFRED! It is my favorite comedy on television today.  We may now have some more clues to the unanswered questions that this final episode has posed, particularly about the picture from Ryan's childhood.  The final episode was great but I was worried that would be the end of the show for good. Jason Gann is brilliant as the Wilfred, the dog that becomes Ryan's, (Elijah Wood's), best friend and confident.  He has all the mannerisms of a real dog down perfectly.  I have not seen the Australian version, also starring Gann in the role of Wilfred, but this is a wonderful american remake which doesn't happen enough.  We will have to wait until June 2013 for Season 3 but it will be worth it."
B008DR2ACI Wilfred is one of the best shows to come around in a long time. This was yet another episode that delves deeply into the human psyche and gets us to think about own own lives and relationships. I love this show!!"
B008DR2ACI I'm a huge fan of this series. I don't usually watch shows of this nature, but they've done a wonderful job adapting this from the Australian version."
B008DR2ACI Great quality, great pricing. It took me a while to finally get hooked on the show. I couldn't get past the talking human-dog. Give it a shot. You won't regret it. Also, I like shows that have morals (I don't need a lesson in religion). I guess I should clarify. I like shows that have clearly defined reasons for being.."
B008DR2ACI This show is completely different, a dog who doesn't exist , and yet he's very real in one mans world. There are sexual comments, and pot smoking, but still a very funny show."
B008DR2ACI If you are a dog owner and aren't put off by dry explicit humor absolutely give this a watch. It is hysterical."
B008DZ91U4 How is it that the British make so many great tv shows?  Really interesting character development, very irreverent about the norms of society ,but not dark, very intelligently written and great production values.  No obvious behavior or cheap shots."
B008DZ91U4 This show has everything. Great plot, amazing actors and twists and turns to take you by surprise even if you think you hve seen it all"
B008DZ91U4 VERY MINOR SPOILERS:I just can't fathom a more harsh penalty promulgated by my delay then to have follow a \"K-Harris\" review!I can't add anything to the excellent outline provided by K-Harris, though perhaps I can compliment with some additional color.  The performances are excellent and as huge fan of UK programming, the 3-main characters all have fine pedigrees:Steven Mackintosh (John the cash house manager) most recently off a stint in the *5 \"Luther\"Ashley Walters (Chris the security guard) was seen in \"Hustle\" and \"Outcasts\" among a number of other seriesWarren Brown (Marcus at what can be best described as a clerk that moves the trolleys of cash into the vault) was in the excellent Zombie themed mini-series \"Dead Set\"I thought that the plotting was good, though I am not the biggest fan of sequences that move back and forth through timelines.  What really interested me was the motives of the 3-individuals and particularly those of John whose star was on the rise and had a newly adopted daughter (their only child).  While it is not a perfect parallel, John reminds me of a similar character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in what was in my opinion a top 3 movie of the year in 2003 entitled \"Owning Mahowny\".  When PSH's character is asked about the rush he felt when gambling as compared to regular life.  On a scale of 10 he replied \"10 and 2\".I watched the series over 2-nights and would recommend as both a very good program and an excellent well acted change of pace from the norm."
B008DZ91U4 This four part British series about a heist gone wrong starts out so strong, it's difficult to maintain the incredible initial intensity throughout.  But anyone who likes contemporary crime drama should definitely check out \"Inside Men.\"  This series has a refreshingly hard edge.  Its central protagonists are not unscrupulous villains, but ordinary men looking for a shortcut to a better life.  As two lower level employees (Warren Brown and Ashley Walters) at a money counting house look to skim from the take, they don't realize that this risky caper is going to open the door to something unfathomable.  When discovered by their supervisor (Steven Mackintosh), his response is not what they would have predicted.  Soon these three \"inside men\" are plotting a scheme that will net them millions!  And as you might expect, it's not easy to plan the perfect crime.The narrative is divided into two timelines that alternate back and forth within a given episode.  The series starts in the midst of the big heist, and the other plot line backtracks to many months before the event.  Not only, therefore, are we seeing the present-day heist spin out of control, we are seeing the tumultuous days leading up to the event.  The actual action sequences are extremely well done and exciting, while the planning stage is also fraught with tension.  All of the men have women and/or families that figure into the scenario in one way or another (kudos to Kierston Wareing, so good in The Take, for channeling her best Lady MacBeth as Brown's girlfriend).  The beauty of this story is that you really never know where it is going.  Having seen the heist in the opening episode, there are still plenty of surprises once the back story catches up and gives us a fresh perspective on what's going on.The pacing of \"Inside Men\" is fast and frenetic and it works so well due to the performances.  Walters is quite solid as the emerging conscience of the group, while Brown is more impetuous.  But, for me, this is Mackintosh's show.  His character arc plays out similarly to Bryan Cranston's in Breaking Bad (although obviously not in as much depth).  Starting as the idealization of a perfect professional family man, his increasing detachment and willingness to explore the darkness of his soul are riveting to watch.  If \"Inside Men\" has any flaws, it is that it comes to a rather hasty conclusion.  Seriously.  When the final episode was over, I actually didn't realize that was the end of the series.  I thought there were more episodes.  Don't get me wrong, things come to a resolution--but it also would have been easy to keep the story continuing.  But that's something I like about British TV (as opposed to American), they aren't boxed into a certain number of shows.  \"Inside Men,\" therefore, doesn't get a chance to burn itself out.  It's just quick, gritty, and memorable. 4 1/2 stars.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B008DZ91U4 This series did not engage my sensibilities enough to pay for the rest of the episodes. It was mediocre - not exciting enough or actually at all. If it went to Prime I would watch it but not worth any more dollars to view. Sorry. Loved the title."
B008EM1DAC Well, the kiddos loved this one also, but it didn't always hold their attention.  It was still good and I'd have to recommend for the little ones"
B008EM1DAC We love this show. Nice short episodes (10 Min). So little ones can sit thru the whole show. Nice learning plot line."
B008EM1DAC Completely charming and effortlessly entertaining. There is an amazing amounbt of learning that takes place amidst the simple stories and adorable animation.....Stwphen Frye is, of course, perfect.....My 3-year-old is outgrowing Elmo but still loves Pocoyo!"
B008EM1DAC My Granddaughter laughs out loud while watching Pocoyo on my Kindle Fire.  She always wants to watch the episodes.  It is good for me also as I can continue watching my shows on TV."
B008EM1DAC My kids love this animated series and spend quite a lot of time on it. Hours go by without losing their interest."
B008EM1DAC my daughter calls this show &#34;baby&#34; and asks for it frequently.  it's very cute and not a lot of noise or crazy animation, so it's good for the little ones."
B008EM1DAC I don't get it. This show reminds me of gumby and pokey from the 60's. I didn't want to get it just from the illustration but my grandson wanted to see it so I bought 2 episodes. He is 3 and likes it. I won't buy anymore because I think it is too mind numing. It only gets 3 stars because he loves it. Must be an acquired taste."
B008EM1DAC We happened upon this show by chance... it was recommended based on another show my daughter was watching. So, my 5-yr-old daughter likes it, and my 2-yr-old son goes CRAZY over it. He starts jumping up and down when we say Pocoyo. :)  As for the content, it's divided up into several mini episodes, so it's easy to stop in the middle without too much kiddo-complaint. It attempts to teach some mild lessons, but it's mostly cute, lively young child entertainment."
B008EM1DAC For kids recognizing shapes and colors. Pretty goofy if you ever sit and watch it."
B008EM1DAC My kids love Pocoyo.  They will sit still with their eyes glued to the screen, laughing and giggling the whole way thru the show."
B008EM1DAC what a pleasure to sit and watch pocoyo with the little ones. we don't watch much tv for obvious reasons. the kids ask for this show and love it. pocoyo teaches lessons of friendship, empathy and kindness and is, of course,so darn cute!"
B008EPHB28 The music is great.  The narration, stories, and animation is good too.  My 3.5 year old loves watching this after he stumbled on the series on youtube."
B008EPHB28 My son and I both love Pocoyo...great for little tykes...wish there were more though. He watches them over and over again..."
B008EPHB28 My son loves this show. The episodes are short (10 Min) so it holds his attention. Cute characters and nice plot line."
B008EPHB28 The show is so simple it's brilliant. It's great for teaching young children about sharing and making friends. It's good for adventure and for learning manners. My and my 3 year old little girl love this show. The bonus is I am a huge fan of Steven Fry."
B008EPHB28 Completely charming and effortlessly entertaining. There is an amazing amounbt of learning that takes place amidst the simple stories and adorable animation.....Stephen Frye is, of course, perfect.....My 3-year-old is outgrowing Elmo but still loves Pocoyo!"
B008EPHB28 Granddaughter is 5 and she likes Pocoyo Season 2 a lot.  Laughs out loud.  Watches the same episodes again after a few days."
B008EPHB28 I would really love it if more of these UK shows had more seasons available. This and Peppa Pig are our 2nd and 3rd fave shows! Behind Thomas, of course :)"
B008EPHB28 Wonderful animated series...my child can't get enough! He will sit and watch episode after episode. Good, wholesome fun for the whole family..."
B008EPHB28 My 20-month-old daughter loves this show!  It's cute and not annoying like some kids shows.  I like that the animation is simple, too."
B008EPHB28 This cartoon is loud, obnoxious and lacks any educational value. I make my children turn it off when I'm around."
B008EPHB28 This is one I'll happily sit down and watch w/ my boys. So fresh, and innocent with great messages. I love the all white background and simplistic point of views. These are funny, informative and help teach the value of love, respect and friendship."
B008EPHB28 A great show that doesn't ramp him up b4 bed. Unique..the epitome of cute fun.that's all I got to say bout that"
B008EQHT4M An entertaining, light show, easy to watch, enough plot to stay interesting, and a steady improvement from the start of the show up through the third season."
B008EQHT4M I feel like I am waiting with bated breath between episodes of Covert Affairs Season 3. I love how much we get to see of Eyal Lavin and there have been so many twists and turns. I feel like we don't get to see enough Auggie and Annie scenes but it ain't over til it's over, right? Meanwhile, we are starting to see how Annie has been changed, possibly for the worst, because of the events in this season. She isn't so bright eyed and shiny anymore. She isn't balanced either. It seemed like she might go \"dark\" and cynical. There just isn't enough time for her to deal with everything she's been through and she doesn't have her lovable, huggable sister or enough Auggie time as I previously mentioned.Fast-paced, awesome. I started watching Covert Affairs this year (and actually went back to watch all the previous seasons as I started Season 3). I had been reluctant because I thought it was an Alias knockoff but it's so different and a fabulous show in its own right with engaging characters and twisty, mysterious plots that keep you coming for more."
B008EQHT4M Interesting characters, attractive women, conflict with the boss (at multiple levels). An intelligent blind guy who supports the principal character adds interest for me."
B008EQHT4M While not realistic, we love this show. Good characters, good dialog and interesting stories. We found this season's stories edgier and better written."
B008EQHT4M The third season is just as good as the first 2. Sorry to see that Jai is no longer a character towards the end of the season but I really enjoy this."
B008EQHT4M Still loved this series. Was disappointed they took away Sendhil Ramamurthy. I understand taking Anne Dudek away, but Sendhil's character...? Also, they gave Annie Walker another love interest in the person of a foreign agent, Simon Fischer,  but did he have to be another Ben Mercer lookalike?"
B008EQHT4M I love this show & I especially love Piper ~ she is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen!!"
B008EQHT4M Action, romance, good plots, charismatic actors, just an all around good series. Hope the show continues for quite a while."
B008EQHT4M The series is very entertaining. I loved watching it from Season 1 through three. The are contemporary and possibly polemic but, I don't think they are politically incorrect. Also, the protagonist, Piper Perabo is wonderful as are her supporting actors. Christopher Gorham finally falls in love with Piper, to his credit. She is a real steal! Thumbs up!"
B008EQHT4M Pure entertainment -not to be believed by any stretch of the imagination!  I think there are too many characters which messes up the continuity"
B008EQHT4M Man this episode left me on the edge of my seat. I hope agent Walker is ok. Great storyline just enough personal life betrayed in the stars lives, but not too much drama. I love this seies hope it continues."
B008EQHT4M My wife and I like the first two seasons more than this one.  Seems off the rails to us.  The main character, Annie, comes off as very lucky instead skilled.  The other seasons where more effective at showing her developing her CIA skills.  Hopefully season four will come available on Prime soon and we can see if things change."
B008EQHT4M This show is a cliff hanger right from the beginning of season 3. There is so much sexual tension and lost love that by the time I got to season 3 I would have bought it if it were $50!!! I am hooked!!"
B008EQHT4M Don't expect any realism when it comes to modern day spy craft. Take this series with several grains of salt. It's clearly a cheaply done series and it shows. I can't even understand how the main character(Piper) ever got the part. I don't even like the look of her and her acting is mediocre at best. Thankfully several other supporting actors in the series hold her up and make the show bearable."
B008EQHT4M GREAT SERIES THAT YOU CAN SEE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ON TV.  PIPER SEEMS TO BE GETTING MORE INTERESTING EACH SEASON."
B008EQHT4M I really didn't think that i would like this show but its turned out to be really good. The characters are likeable and the storyline is good. The first season appeared to be low budget but its a decent show now. Worth watching."
B008EQHT4M All the cast is good. They play their parts so realistically I think they make the show the best of the spy series. Also they are very good looking, both guys and girls."
B008EQHT4M I love this show because you never know what is going to happen next!  The language is clean (most of the time), and if you do not like how things are going wait a few minutes it will change!  I consider it entertaining!  It's different, I love all but 2 of the characters, but then you are not suppose to like them anyway.  I enjoy there creativity on resolving issues.  It stimulates your brain, makes you think.  It is so different than all the trashy shows that are out there today.  It's fun.  I think this is an awesome series!!I cannot wait for season 4 to become available to all the Prime Members!"
B008EQHT4M Outstanding way too end this season. The characters and storylines are only getting better and better. Well worth the time to watch. Entertaining without being vulgar."
B008EQHT4M I really like these types of shows.  the only thing upsetting is I have watched the entire series from 1 thru 3.  Get to 4 and now they want to charge.  I already pay Amazon for my Roku and don't feel this is right.  But love the show."
B008EQHT4M Excellent writing and acting; a very fun show to watch year after year.  A very creative suspense/crime drama without the type of non-stop graphic violence found in other programs in this genre."
B008EQHT4M We can't get enough of this world traveling spy series~great all the way around. Great that the series is using a sight impaired , yet hard working, determined war vet! Call it what you may, but much cudos especially since the shape the world , and society is!"
B008EQHT4M wish you had season 4! can't wait to see it in amazon prime. It's good to see a woman lead who has a brain!"
B008EQHT4M Love how they bring in Mossad, Some of the best episodes are how they play off this. Great series Love it"
B008EQHT4M I am glad they brought back this show, season 3, this episode is good. Looking forward to watching the next one.."
B008EQHT4M Each season gets better and better.  The writers are giving  the characters more depth and expanded personalities and the stories are lasting longer as well; instead of wrapping up at the end of each episode.  I enjoy the wanting of hurrying up to see the next episode just to see what happens next.  Good Job writers."
B008EQHT4M I am totally hooked on this series.The plots, dialog, and acting are good enough to keep me begging for more.There are usually 2 stories going on in each show and the editing is simply great..... they know when to leave a cliff hanger and when to tell the rest of the story.Annie's got that beautiful smile that charms male and female into doing exactly what she wants. I love the action and I adore all the beautiful place they go. The art direction is top-notch and beauty shots make you feel you have traveled there yourself. I have raced thru these first 3 seasons and I am now watching the current season on TV. I think I am a Covet Affairs junkie. I will watch 3-4 back to back shows before forcing myself to turn it off. Love this show."
B008EQHT4M Lots of good episodes with this season. Others who have checked it oiut of the library have said how much they have enjoyed it as well."
B008EQHT4M This is a great show - - - good writing - - -interesting charactors - - - good locations ."
B008EQHT4M A great series with the best qualified actors/actresses.  I eagerly looked forward to each episode.  It had its serious side, but also humor at times.  I think this would be good for families to watch together.  Augie's roll really was wonderful and made it different from the same old, same old.  It is action packed."
B008EQHT4M The best thing bout this series is the fact that the spies are not the normal infallible types in most shows of this genre"
B008EQHT4M Each episode can stand alone but fits well in a broader structure that is going somewhere, Piper is very entertaining."
B008EQHT4M Covert Affairs is an enjoyable series with a woman lead character. The supporting cast make an entertaining program seem totally believable. Where else can a very light weight woman beat off men and women and not sustain one scratch?"
B008EQHT4M My wife and I enjoy this season immensely. I try not to make a habit of watching often but as I overhear the plots twisting and turning, it is impossible not to be drawn into the life, loves and career of this very special agent with a heart.The scenery, the props and locations are superb as no expense has been spared in this high-budget thriller. The actors are fabulous and well-suited to their roles.We find that some episodes are slower than others but they all remain pertinent to the progression of the story and we find that the production, writing and directing of this season remain excellent. Together this team of story-tellers has brought forth another winner...enjoy"
B008EQHT4M Very good spy show, characters are interesting and the show to show subplots make you want to watch the next episode."
B008EQHT4M this is a edge of the chair type TV program..but always  ends well I am up to date on all the episodesand waiting on the next ones to be viewed."
B008EQHT4M I like this show because there is suspense, action, lots of twists, and they keep the violence to a minimum! Really good ensemble cast, really good acting just a great show!"
B008EQHT4M I really like this show can't wait until season 4 comes to prime. I even paid for a few of these shows."
B008EQHT4M great characters and almost real situations....entertaining not too deep....she is fun to watchwith no commercials goes by quickly ..."
B008EQHT4M I love this season with all the intrigue and new character especially Hill Harper role! Annie has really been great this season I love Piper in this role! Keep Annie and Auggie together!"
B008EQHT4M There is a good mix of weekly story lines mixed with longer term stories and issues.  They keep it fresh and keep you guessing."
B008EQHT4M I have always enjoyed the antics of Annie Walker, she certainly came out of her shell in this Series.  I would like to have seen more discs to make the  Series longer."
B008EQHT4M i'm still enjoying season three and can't wait for season four to start,this has to be the best season thus far in this great seriesthanks for getting it to me so quick"
B008EQHT4M The show is not outstanding but it is not the worst I have seen. The characters are typical and the plots are o.k."
B008EQHT4M I like the fact that this series is moving past the bubble-gum & rainbows stage and is assuming a more edgy attitude."
B008EQHT4M This series is good clean fun.  I like the relationship developments and the story lines are exciting and eventful.  Enjoy!"
B008EQHT4M watched in to ep 7 3rd season - shows the development of an agent from the beginning to the serious and the purpose in which she believes _ good acting and great writing without the nonsense - just hope our real people are not this way, but good entertainment"
B008EQHT4M One of their own is killed and the CIA is on the manhunt.  Political intrigue at its peak as the top new CIA officer is put to the test and finds that one of her supervisors is a plant and traitor.  Anne loyalty is tested as far as friendship with other agent of different services and also within her own ranks.  She loses a major support structure, but survives a little wiser and bitter about how things played out."
B008EQHT4M Once again a great season.  All great episodes and Piper is hot. I can't wait for season four to be here."
B008EQHT4M I do subscribe to this show through Amazon so it was not too surprising when a new one showed up off the weekly cycle.  It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long, even though it still costs $1.89.  It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler. It takes place in Barcelona and since I haven't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful.  The story is sort of weak, given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq.  Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all.  It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode."
B008EQHT4M Still a fun and fast moving series.  Looking forward to Season 4.  Looks like we have lost some of the beginning stars, so let's see who joins the team now."
B008EQHT4M Unlike the second season, I think theres been a twist or shift in this character. I love this season so far it is the best one to me."
B008EQHT4M Covert Affairs reminds me of that show, Alias. I've watched it since it started. All of the FBI, CIA, NCIS, police dramas, etc. are my favorites. I enjoy watching Covert Affairs episodes over and over. I can't wait to see what Annie, Auggie, Joan and Aarthur will do next."
B008EQHT4M We enjoy watch Annie as she progresses in her skill set as a spy the interaction she has with her sister in hiding that she is a spy to when she reads her sister in and how Annie handles rejection as well as how Annie and her sister make amends. This is a great show good action. Nice narrations.  The series seems to be well connected between episodes."
B008EQHT4M Great show. Have been watching COVERT since season one.  The characters are great. Special kudos to Augie and Annie.  You really need to watch from the first episode so you can relate to all the characters and how the plot develops with each episode.  The truth is I watch this show (like other shows I like) on Amazon because I really, really don't like commercials.The other great TV show I watch on Amazon is CASTLE. Like above, you really need to get into the characters to enjoy. Once you do, YOU'RE HOOKED! Glad the new season is starting soon."
B008EQHT4M Annie is selected to work in another department, presumably because of her attitude and results, but then gets dismissed for those exact reasons. (Just like in a real job.) Later, she gets involved with a Russian and suddenly she's back in favor with the head of the department that grabbed her in the beginning and later said &#34;no thanks.&#34; If that sounds confusing, it is. It seems all of the main characters are in transition in this season, and for the most part, not in a good way. There's a death (murder), an arrest for a bar fight and other assorted misdeeds. It's still a good program, but not as good as the first two seasons."
B008EQHT4M Covert Affairs is getting better and better and I was disappointed that season 4 is not ready for Amazon Prime!"
B008EQHT4M Love this show and it's international intrigue.Good personal stories as well.Acting and story telling get better each season."
B008EQHT4M MINOR SPOILERS:Annie (Piper Perabo) has not been shy in showing some \"skin\" in seasons past, though this year she takes things to a new level by actually sleeping with an \"assignment\" under the new \"darker\" direction of the series.  Furthermore, while her simmering feelings for Auggie (Christopher Gorham) have not yet been consummated, towards the end of the season we learn that perhaps they are not quite one-sided.  An interesting storyline at the conclusion of season 2 re: Auggie not (yet) being a candidate for some radical procedure that could potentially bring his vision back, was not touched upon in season 3 at all.  However, I have to believe that the Covert Affairs \"brain trust\" is holding the return of Auggie's eyesight hostage for maximum dramatic effect.  I would be surprised that if prior to the conclusion of the series that we don't see (pun intended) both Auggie's eyesight returning and him and Annie hooking up!The fact that they involved production people from the highly successful Bourne Movie Series on several of the final episodes (mid-season), is evidence of the intent to change the series direction from less of a \"bubble gummy\" soap opera to something closer to a \"24\".  So far, I like the direction."
B008EQHT4M there is no way a blind person can do what that character does, which makes it fiction and not realistic.  she is to much into her self and is really not that bright.  too make believe.  there are two excellent actors in this series; however they have minor roles which is too bad."
B008EQHT4M The action heats up in the third season and Annie is tougher. So the show is more complex, less like a soap and much more entertaining."
B008EQHT4M really like the show, like the characters,like the theme,not bogged down with crap, sometimes a little too vague, but still better them most..........."
B008EQHT4M I am absolutely in love/obsessed with Covert Affairs. I feel that the extremely positive reviews speak for themselves, but I too agree with the positives about this series: excellent character development, fast paced action, exciting locales, well developed, engaging and suspenseful plot line, and most of all this is all done without excessive use of language or violence."
B008EQHT4M If you are a fan of action, this is a must see! I love the series and can't wait to finish!"
B008EQHT4M I'm sorry to see the romance story arc with Simon end but hoping we've seen the start of a new one. Also does a good job of creating a new super villian for the CIA to track down.The story was improved by having it produced as dream sequences interspersed with \"reality\" sequences."
B008EQHT4M It is a fabulous show with lots of intrigue and interesting characters, plots, story line, supporting actors, and ACTION ACTION!"
B008EQHT4M I watched each episode with Amazon prime and can't wait for the new season.  All of the characters are great.  I think the show will only get better."
B008EQHT4M Ok, where are the writers going with this series? First Annie was the spy of the new age and now she just sucks! She fell in love with a charge and at every turn this season, she can't get anything right. I say again, where are the writers going with this series? If they don't hurry up and make her a super spy again, I'm going to have to let this series go! I hope the next episode is much better because man in the middle was stupid and predictable!"
B008EQHT4M Each episode has a lot of suspense that keeps your interest. You want to continue to the next episode right away to see what happens next. The acting is very good and the filming quality and locations are not low budget! Watch the first one and your hooked!"
B008EQHT4M This series is entertaining and has enough suspense to keep you interested.  Annie Walker's character has evolved and matured, which is necessary for the story line and, thankfully, the writers have allowed it.  The plots are, of course, unrealistic at times, but this is TV, not reality.  There are some characters that are just plain flat.  Bottom line is that Walker carries the show, but it is enough!"
B008EQHT4M In this season, Annie Walker, CIA agent, is no longer a novice. She begins to take more risks and defy her managers in the chain of command. Her character hardens a bit and she doesn't smile as often. I give the writers credit for character development. Backdrops for the plot sequences took viewers around the world. The storyline for Auggie, her good friend and tech expert, develops as well. The actor plays the character as complex, caring, savvy, yet vulnerable. Good job. The friendship between him and Annie is very believable."
B008EQHT4M Awesome season. I have all three seasons.I will be getting season four when it comes out. Very good acting and story line."
B008EQHT4M Have followed this series from the beginning.  Have lived the characters, varied plots, however I have found the fourth season a bit TOO predictable leaving me a bit less interested!"
B008EQHT4M good acting, nice script and full of surprises.  look forward to when the next season comes to prime time for viewing"
B008EQHT4M I've been finding interesting older series on Prime and enjoying them.  Sometimes straight through the series.  This one is a good one.  Not to mention I like the sassy theme song (even downloaded it from the web).  Characters are good and stories are both fun and fast-paced and fresh."
B008EQHT4M I love the chemistry between she and Auggie!  Keep this up, this series is well-written, action packed, and filled with all the best messages young girls need!  She is intelligent and strong and resourceful and entirely bad-ass in the best possible way!"
B008EQHT4M I love the writing and love the incidental and supporting characters and actors, so the fact that Piper Perabo is lightweight and squeaky is bearable.  Monica Bello would have been incredible in this role-  she has gravity and color, wit and sophistication.Also, the music is so cheesy it's hard to get through the opening credits."
B008EQHT4M Great show keeps you in suspense. Acting is good. Piper is great. Now I can watch a the new ones I caught up"
B008EQHT4M love piper, she kicks  butt. girl spy very cool. auggie's pretty cool too! blind spy who would thunk it would work."
B008EQHT4M Terrific action packed series. Absolutely loved it!. I purchased the first episode of season 4, but will wait until Prime has it free."
B008EQHT4M I truly enjoy the fast paced adventures of Annie Walker.  I love her feisty character as well as the superb cast of characters (and their actors) who surround her.  Since I watch it through Prime, the show has completed it's season on USA, so when the arc with Sara Clarke came to its resolve it was so neat to go on to the next episode.  All of the regular cast and the guest actors are such wonderfully talented and delightfully entertaining performers, especially Piper Perabo and Matt Gorham.  Their relationship has been heating up, and the gap between now and the availability of Season Four on Prime will be a long and painful wait.  But it will be worth it."
B008EQHT4M It took half the first season before I really &#34;got into it&#34;, love Annie and Auggie,not the deepest story line, but like a good summer book to read-I am looking forward to the next season."
B008EQHT4M I'm so glad that they are making a season 4 because this drama is so fun to watch. I like Piper Perabo as the CIA agent. The stories keep you on the edge of your seat."
B008EQHT4M Good story line well rounded characters, relate-able characters and the series has gathered steam with each successive season.  It definitely has legs!"
B008EQHT4M Seeing a young lady control her life in this difficult world of the CIA is a message of the growing opportunities for females in our society. Her supervisor role, also, accents this change. I do enjoy this show even though some of the roles seem quite a push. Give it a try!"
B008EQHT4M Glad we stumbled over this one on Amazon Instant Video.  Good plot and good characters.  Definitely worth the time to watch."
B008EQHT4M I like this show. It is one of my favorite genres. Mystery, covert ops, intrigue, often these adjectives are followed by heavy subjects and graphic violence. Which I enjoy also. However, this series is all that but lighter, and not too many faux pas that wouldmake you say - this could not happen. I enjoy watching this series."
B008EQHT4M That is how I watched this series. It is fun to watch if you expect nothing else than just passing some time watching old fashion TV without paying a lot of attention. The main character's acting is terrible. She is pretty and fit. And there is not scene in which you can believe for a second that she is CIA or scared or being tortured or in love. She looks at every men with exactly the same expression. Which is exactly the same expression that she has when she looks at women. Or walls. Or guns. Or phones. Or whatever. The writing is poor so what she looks at really does not matter. But the series is not bad as in hard to watch. It is quite easy to pass the time with it. It is the old fashion TV formula -- a CIA target is discovered, pursued, and turned or captured in less than a day by an unexperienced, not really compelling pretty girl making cute dog faces without any clever plan. There also some senseless subplots with absurd conspiracies--most of them focused on Russia because here the Cold War has not ended--and the CIA here is run by a married couple in which he is the big boss and she is something of a maternal #2. They could have made a vintage piece, a la Mad Men, and it would have been charming, but comparing this to Mad Men is like comparing the taste of the best chocolate to an used chewing gum."
B008EQHT4M Sometimes the episodes are a bit hokey, like the one where the guy from Yemen comes over, but Augie is a dream boat.I thought the episode in Cuba was fun. That's as far as we've gotten so far. Nice to see &#34;Nina&#34; from &#34;24&#34; again."
B008EQHT4M This is a really good show. Well-plotted and performed. The lady spy is lovely, gorgeous even and Augie gives us all hope."
B008EQHT4M This series makes an unlikely scenario believable. Not easy to do. So much intrigue  so much treachery. So many twists and turns. How can poor girl get through all though all theses stressful experiences and still be strong. The answe is that probably no one could ever endure this. Yet the series convinces us that it is possible. Stay tuned. America might be safe, after all"
B008EQHT4M They've tried to add more danger, intrigue and heat (suspense and romance) into the show.  I had settled into and was enjoying how it WAS and the change is a little off-putting to me.  Some people might like it better, actually."
B008EQHT4M The characters and story line are engaging. The interaction of characters makes you wish you were an CIA agent."
B008EQHT4M not the best series i have ever watched] but it is entertaining. i think most people will enjoy it, so go for it."
B008EQHT4M I was on the fence as to whether or not that I should order a season pass.  Guess what!  I should not have.  Had I known that a 20 minute episode (Sight Unseen) was going to be thrown in at a full charge, I would have picked only the full-length episodes to purchase and download.  I feel a bit taken since this so-called prequel IS free online, but not here on amazon.  I feel a bit taken."
B008EQHT4M This episode answers the question on whether Annie is in love with Simon, or Simon is in love with Annie.The show continues to go new places, both in terms of scenery (with Puerto Rico standing in for Cuba), and plot development.And Lena continues to be so supportive, and Annie's near misses so close - that you really begin to wonder about that relationship."
B008EQHT4M I'm a spy movie fan and I'd like to go with the fantasy, but it's just too contrived. It's so predictable that it's not much fun."
B008EQHT4M it keeps you in suspense with its change overs  and always want to see what happens with the next assignment."
B008EQHT4M We watched it together and really loved it. We really like being able to watch two or three episodes in a row. Is there another season? Please say YES!"
B008EQHT4M This is a great series, not any foul mouth stuff.  Has a unique love humor between Annie and one of her co-workers.I have watched all three season through Amazon and I'm now spoiled because it is the only way I like to watch TV anymore.  I know season 4 is offered through on-demand but I have to pay extra so I'll wait until the whole season.It is starting to get a little too much repeat of the story line so we will see what happens in season 4."
B008EQHT4M Love this show, and SO happy you have it available - takes too long waiting for fancast and/or hulu - ;o)"
B008EQHT4M Young Annie Walker is pulled out of the CIAs farm program in season one. She does so well in the field that they keep exposing her to increasingly more difficult assignments. In season 2, she gets a gun.  In season 3 she proves capable of killing, even if with regrets in her own mind, it is required."
B008EQHT4M Every year I seem to be watching the USA Network more and more. This is another exciting show they have added to their showings the last couple of years. If you enjoy other shows on the USA Network, you will enjoy this show."
B008EQHT4M This was OK. The premise was good, but the lead actress didn't quite pull-it-off as a killer person. Though she was attractive, the lead actress needed to be a more intense serious type person."
B008EQHT4M I stumbled onto the series with the first episode and haven't missed it since! Looking forward to Season 4 next month."
B008EQHT4M Been watching all episodes since the beginning.  It is just as good at this point as it was at episode 1."
B008EQHT4M This is a great addition to the series, I think this lady is a great actor, and portrays the secret service is a good manner"
B008EQHT4M Finished watching Covert Affairs season 3 and had a good time watching this with family. This season keeps you on the edge for some nice action packed drama. The main character is obviously Annie Walker portrayed by Piper Perabo who surprisingly has done some excellent acting. All the other characters has done excellent acting too making this whole season worth watching. Good story-line & never a dull moment. I do like the fact that every episode has something new to watch which takes you to various parts of the globe.Fun filled action packed drama season 1-3 were. I am waiting for Season 4 to become Prime Eligible. Amazon please make that happen. Five stars for season3!"
B008EQHT4M This show is spectacular .. I have watched all the seasons and all the shows and want more !  Piper comes on strong - and has never ending talent - she doesn't quit - and sets the screen on fire.  And Auggie !!  .. what can I saw beside awesome.  Together - they are an amazing team which make an incredible show !  Other characters in the show are charismatic also."
B008EQHT4M I was afraid this was going to be another one of those mindless bounceand jiggle Charlies Angels type shows, but it's far from it. The characters are wonderful. You actually care about them, even the secondary characters are important to the show and personable. I'd watch it just to see Joan and Augie... Thats a real compliment to the writers. They and the actors bring these characters to life and get you emotionally involved, beyond the spy stuff, which by the way is very believable. Not alot of McGyver stuff, or suddenly they're free without explanation. everything is well thought out and real. Bring on season four!"
B008EQHT4M It rough and tumble fun and games.  Figuring out who to trust is hard on the characters.  An interesting season that holds together pretty well."
B008EQHT4M I am very pleased with my purchase. This season of Covert Affairs was another great season of the series. I am looking forward to next season of Covert Affairs."
B008EQHT4M I could hardly wait to get my hands on season 3 to see how she would get into and out of the situations she always gets into."
B008EQHT4M Great episode, I love how each one gets better and better. Now if Joan would wear some sleeves, I would be much happier."
B008EQHT4M Next season of Covert Affairs didn't let us down. There is good interplay between the characters and intrigue and interesting twists in the storyline. We enjoy watching it."
B008EQHT4M This has quickly become one of my favorite TV series.  It has action, drama, suspense, romance, and exocitic locations all rolled into one show.  Love it."
B008EQHT4M I have become a big fan of hers.  The stories are intriguing and well acted.  I love a good spy story.  I hope it continues for many more years."
B008EQHT4M Much improbable stuff and yet you want her to overcome.  Even though you suspend belief that the CIA is anything like this, the characters are engaging."
B008EQHT4M I gave the reviews for the first two series 5 stars because the series was fun to watch. As the series progress the fun has gone and become much more serious. Still look forward to each show but so serious which is more like it should be since it is about the CIA."
B008EQHT4M The story lines are fast moving and exciting.  Sometimes it seems a bit convoluted but the twists in the plot resolve and things work out in the end."
B008EQHT4M I have found it just un-self conscious enough to watch without any negative vibes.  She looks good in all disguises and can really run in stiletto heels.  Don't know if all the exotic scenes from around the world or actually &#34;on location&#34; but they add.  Piper appears to be a real athlete, but this is Hollywood."
B008EQHT4M I am a fan of governmental dramas and some sci fi as well.  This may be sort of a cross between 24 and perhaps a little of Alias.  Really enjoy the action and high drama."
B008EQHT4M Covert Affairs is one of the greatest spy tv series of this generation!  If you liked James Bond for fighting bad guys with guns and gadgets, then you will love Annie Walker as she uses her good looks and CIA skills to get &#34;passed&#34; the bad guys.This is a series that will leave you hooked and wanting more!  A completely must-see adventure that proves that looks &#34;do&#34; kill."
B008EQHT4M Give the spy game a new twist. Love the tension between Augie and Annie. Would like to see them go somewhere with that."
B008EQHT4M I don't usually write reviews, but I thought this was worth it.  Came across this on Amazon Prime downloads and started watching it.  Started slow at first, but became more interesting as the series went on."
B008EQHT4M This show is awesome!  Who knew the CIA was so complicated!  And Annie, man!  She gets all the guys haha.  It leads up to a shocking finale so I cannot wait for Season 4 to air this July!"
B008EQHT4M Great plots. But the final cut usually shows their emotions too much. That is unrealistic in real life spy stuff. Nobody can have a real relationship. They always portray a relationship like this. &#34;I love you and I will go to the ends of the earth for you.&#34; &#34;OK, lets go to the end of the earth.&#34; &#34;Uh. . .Let me think about it.&#34;"
B008EQHT4M I like the way they have developed the characters in this show in the past seasons and this one is no exception. The last episode was still a surprise though; I kind of hoped she'd take up with the Mosad character to string it out till she and Augie got together."
B008EQHT4M Love this show! the characters are great and work together especially Piper. It takes place in different countries and scenery is great. Can't wait for next season. If you love spy shows you will enjoy this one."
B008EQHT4M It's good escape. I was about to give up in the first 2 seasons because it was a little too Polly Anny, with sugar sweet screen writes and some rough acting at times. I was about to get a back case of sugar-induced tooth decay in season one, but I am glad I did not give up because.....Kudos for a big improvement in story line, acting and especially cinematography in season 3 that gives a dark edge to this show. The visuals are much more eye appealing, the heroine is a little too good and escapes some unbelievable situations, but that is not a major detractor for me."
B008EQII56 Talk about sibling rivalry to the max! This was a funny movie that lets you see that sibling rivalry does not always fade with time and age. Through a series of events, these two brothers battle it out to see who can win. While much of the movie is tongue-in-cheek, you can also see that the brothers do learn a few things along the way as well. While I did not know whether I would like this movie at first, I found the movie to be downright funny and the acting to be of high quality. If you are looking for a fun evening that you will not soon forget, this is definitely the movie for you!"
B008EQII56 One of the tricks to writing a drama script is saying things a bit larger than life but still making them seem conversational. Here, the story is more on the small side so the conversation really needs to sound true to the ear but not boring. For my dollar the Duplass brothers really nailed it.Here's the scoop. Jeremy makes his living playing poker. His brother, Mark, consults on, and markets, pet food. The two held a 25 event do-deca pentathlon when they were kids. It ended in a tie due to grandpa's intervening in the final event. Mark has never gotten over this and the two have had near zero contact ever since. Mark flies, with his wife and son, to his mum's house for his birthday. Jeremy shows up and the pot starts to boil once more.This seemed to get rather lukewarm reviews from most but I liked it a lot. Like their later \"Jeff Who Lives at Home\", the Duplass brothers bring you into a world with normal people who are trying to work through something. It isn't big to the world but it's big to them and they are able to draw the viewer to the character's world and have it mean something to them as well. Maybe because the set-up is a bit silly (a childhood rivalry blown up beyond all possible belief) there is a humorous undertone happening, but this is a drama, just not one that is of 'life or death' proportions. I thought the small cast was spot on. The brothers were cast well and Jennifer Lefleur, as Marks' wife was so real it was scary. The setting, a middle of the road house, added to the regular-ness of the whole thing. There was a lot of natural lighting and hand-held camera that furthered the whole thing even more. The music score underlined the above mentioned humor but settled down when necessary.This is not a big movie. It's a true independent endeavor but for me, that was what made it a real gem to watch."
B008EQII56 This is a story of two brothers, each over age forty, who decide to Compete in a bunch of games to see who is More superior. They decide that by the choice they made, they would be better in moving on in life in the Right direction. Very Funny And Entertaining from start to finish. Many families would relate to the 'who's better thing' and get a kick out of the show these guys perform to come out as a winner. Laugh-out-loud fun, enjoyable and Highly Recommended!"
B008EQII56 Not enough humorous moments.  Typical try-to-hard to be funny but falls flat.  But that's just me.  A 15 year old may get more out of it."
B008EQII56 \"The Do-Deca-Pentathlon\"  is about two grown men who take sibling rivalry to hilarious heights.  Mark (Steve Zissis) is a thirty-something married guy with a preteen son, who never got over an event from his teen years when he and his brother Jeremy competed in a homegrown, 25-event Olympics-style competition to see who was the best brother.  As adults, the overachieving, self-satisfied Jeremy (Mark Kelly) appears at Mark's birthday, turning what was to be a pleasant, low-key reunion into a confrontation that brings to the fore all of Mark's numerous, poorly hidden insecurities.  When Jeremy suggests a re-do of their teen feats, Mark takes the bait, as Jeremy knew he would.The goofy \"events\" of the pseudo Olympics include miniature golf, ping-pong, laser tag, and leg wrestling, which offer plenty of opportunity for visual gags.  Essentially, the movie is a one-joke comedy, with two adults acting like kids to \"one-up\" each other.  However, the movie does examine the frequently awkward connection between siiblings, a subject we don't see covered a lot in movies.The filmmakers, Mark and Jay Duplass, have stated that the film is based on brothers who lived near them when they were kids, but it's hard not to think that the feelings conveyed in this movie -- if not the actual events -- are autobiographical.  Blu-ray extras include the featurettes \"Meet the Real Brothers\" and \"Rock, Paper, Scissors With the Real Brothers.\""
B008ET98Z2 I love this show.  When It first came out, I was not interested, but ended up watching an episode that came on in the middle of the day.  I couldn't believe how funny it was.  Here is a show that can be appreciated by everyone.  Some one my age (31) who can look back on my high school years and be thankful they are over, while finding humor in the situation.  Anyone my age probably had a mean girl like Sadie who would say something hateful to people (but at least she says Your Welcome after) and made you hate her and think that she was a bad person.  On the show you see that while Sadie says terrible things, she is very human and you end up relating to the mean girl. Some one high school age can relate the characters and experiences that they may be having right now.  They should be able to see the humor in the situation and maybe feel not so alone.  Is the show over the top, yes, and some much better for it.  All of the characters are very different from each other but compliment each other well. I love following Jenna on her journey through the mess that is high school and hope to have more"
B008ET98Z2 The hook is which guy will the main character choose? It's stretched on so long now that maybe we don't care."
B008ET98Z2 I absolutely love this show. I have season 1 and watched this season on tv. I am now watching season 3 on tv. I think this is a very good show. But, I don't think it is for everyone."
B008ET98Z2 If you liked the first season, you'll like this one, possibly even better than the first. This is a mildly addicting show and I recommend to fans of drama who don't mind the themes of teen-aged sex and alcohol consumption."
B008ET98Z2 It's a great show, but not for the younger set.  Although the really strong language is bleeped out, the show itself gets a little raunchy sometimes.  Don't try to compare this to a real-life situations.  Best to watch it because you need to take a time-out and watch a show that will make you smile, chuckle and maybe even laugh out loud."
B008ET98Z2 This is way to sexually explicit for a young person to act.  I guess the world has changed so that this is normal behavior in some homes.  To bad."
B008ET98Z2 I love this show!  It has comdey, drama and everything I like.  Although I am an older person who probably shouldn't be interested in this kind of show, I like it very much!"
B008ET98Z2 I liked the first season better but the second one is pretty awesome too. Glad I own it so i can watch it repeatedly"
B008ET98Z2 entertaining but it tends to repeat itself a lot and sometimesdoes not seem very believable. but it does have it's momentsand will grow on you after a while."
B008ET98Z2 Other than some overtly sexual content, this is a great show to share with your teenager.  Who hasn't felt completely awkward at this age?  We had some interesting discussions."
B008ET98Z2 More laughter, segued right into season 3 without a pause!  I recommend this show - great writing, great characters as well."
B008ET98Z2 The first season, with new stories, same great acting and writing. Something I find too good to be true most of the time. Not here."
B008ET98Z2 I can't believe I'm saying this but MTV has a winner in awkward. It's genuinely funny and has some pretty great characters. Some of the love plot lines are ridiculous but the characters keep growing on you. Good for a mindless weekend watch."
B008ET98Z2 Season 2! Almost as good as season1!"
B008ET98Z2 Enjoyed season 2 but thought the main character was starting to look a old for the part and definitely heavier."
B008ET98Z2 Love this show and Jenna and her high school angst.  We should all have such problems!  Like all &#34;teen&#34; shows the teenagers look more like 20 somethings and a little disturbed by the active sex lives they begin at 15-16 years of age.  Now we know where all the teenage mom's come from!"
B008ET98Z2 I enjoyed it because my granddaughter is 16 years old - this is way different than the teen shows of my day - 16 year olds now are more like me in my 20's I think.  I wonder if the lifestyle is at all true to life for 16 year olds in average however.  The actors are all good and it is great to see issues never talked about in my high school years out in the open today."
B008ET98Z2 It is obvious that it is for the younger generation, but I have enjoyed watching it, it has good acting and writing.  I have watched all the season available on Amazon Prime.  Would recommend to the upper teenagers and anyone who just wants to watch some good comedy."
B008EYQQPM All the usual characters.  Good performances by all the actors, as always with a strong story line with a surprise ending.Would recommend this series to anyone who loves court room drama with a twist"
B008EYQQPM Damages is well written and plotted, with wonderful acting. It stands head and shoulders above most shows on television. Kudos also for casting an older woman in a leading roll. John Goodman was wonderful in his role as Howard T. Erickson, the head of Blackwater Security. The show is smart and engaging, so rare these days.I enjoyed this season far more than last season. The death of (Tate Donovan) playing Thomas Shayes made the body count rather high. There was also a general gloom to season 3, which I found depressing. Cynicism makes the show more gripping, but can go too far."
B008EYQQPM Excellen show, I continue to be amazed at the plots twist and turns, and the boldness of the writing is amazing."
B008EYQQPM Unbelievable show... Who thinks this stuff up? All I can saw is that Damages has to come from some reality!!! I can't believe how terrific the cast works together and The set, clothes and dialog is the best....thanks for making my reality a cake walk...If I get in trouble I am calling Glenn Close to come to my rescue! Because I certainly want her on my side..."
B008EYQQPM I was \" a day late & a dollar short \" seeing this series on tv..but when I discovered it, I needed to go back and see the beginning and play catch-up..thanks Amazontv. This show is well written and full of twists, turns and \" man, I never saw that coming \". Cannot wait for the new season !!.IF there is no 5th season..I recommend people view 1-4 on Amazon."
B008EYQQPM Never ever a dull moment with this program; a fun ride is always guaranteed! Glenn Close is simply phenomenal in her role.  Season 4 is the best so far, as far as I am concerned!"
B008EYQQPM I was very upset this afternoon whan I tried to watch the last 5 episodes- I had watched the first 5 with my Prime Membership and all of a sudden it is no longer prime- but will cost.  I was going to leave a 1 star review because I felt cheated- but first I \"chatted\" with a customer service rep and amazon did what it has always done- in my experience- they made it right.  They gave me a credit to cover the rest of the season.  It took only a few mins and I just ordered them w/no charge.  The season is great and now I can give it what it deserves 5 stars. John Goodman in a complete departure from his usually funny roles is amazing as the creepy religious father- who orders murders like he orders dinner while telling the kids \"go ahead open your presents.  Thanks amazon!  can't wait to see the rest."
B008EYQQPM This season has even more complexity as the pair seem (at times) to get along. Very complex client line makes this one move quickly."
B008EYQQPM Well I loved the first three seasons watched them straight through. Its NOT that season four is bad but for me I couldn't stomach it.The series is pretty gory with characters lacking in moral compass in many ways but watching atrocities is not my idea of entertainment, far too raw for me.Acting is always wonderful and written well ."
B008EYQQPM I've watched this series  for 4 seasons. The acting is consistantly great!  Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are both excellent actors and they deserve higher star ratings than the the show is getting in season 4.  Some people are givingpoor ratings with 1-2 stars because of a change in Amazon's policy to not offer it free starting in season 4 with the amazon prime video membership. These poor reviews are bringing the actual show ratings down.  Amazon's policy change has nothing to do with the quality of the actual show. I wish people would rate the acting and writing quality of the show  correctly and not lower it because they're pissed off at Amazon."
B008EYQQPM Each year you hate Patty a little bit more, but each year she proves herself worthy...Ellen continues to hang in there being abused and watching her back.....great show..but start from the first season to get the full effect."
B008EYQQPM I was hooked when this show first came on TV.  To my dismay, I was not able to see the last 2 seasons due to direct tv's purchase of the property.  Thankfully, Amazon Prime came through and I was able to complete it.  Season 4 proved better than the others.  Always on the edge of my seat.  Great writing, directing and acting."
B008EYQQPM This was a fascinating but serious series that probably was  too realistic for some people.  All in all, well done."
B008EYQQPM Sometimes tough to follow b
B008EYQQPM I watched this season because the first three chapter's were engrossing, but the intensity of those seasons I found lacking in this chapter."
B008EYQQPM I was so dissapointed with this season. I can't figure out why they had to sully up the season with so much filth, sex and bad language. I noticed it consistantly has a low rating so I can see that no one else liked it either. All the other seasons were so good and that tells me that people don't want all that filth. I hope they do better with the 5th season."
B008EYQQPM I watched the first three seasons of Damages on comcast, but was very lucky to be able to catch up on my Kindle Fire. I thought this season was excellent drama, but disturbing at times because of the tension of the plot. Glenn Close is such a fantastic actress that it's easy to lose yourself in her nastiness."
B008EYQQPM This season 4 of Damages is so full of drama and twist and turns.  It kept me in suspence the whole series.  These are some of the best actors around.  I think you will find this series superior to anything being shown on cable.  It is geared to the late teen and adult viewers."
B008EYQQPM Pay attention so you don't miss anything, there's no snoozing during this show.  You'll learn to love and hate everyone."
B008EYQQPM Suspense carries this series and satisfaction is not guaranteed.  And you keep on watching because new facets of character are revealed in the toughest situations."
B008EYQQPM Wow it's amazing how many of us were in the middle of season 4 when they did this.I had just discovered Damages finally the week they decided to make the change.I was all the way through episode 8 of season 4 when I went to bed, next day I get up, go to work, and come home to finish up and bam no more Prime watching of Season 4.I was really surprised.I have been a Prime member for right around 3 years now, way before the Prime videos, and I push it a lot to a lot of people I work with because there are some advantages if you use them.But WOW, Prime came back to bite me on this one, as lame as it sounds this is my biggest let down with Prime, mainly because I have had such good luck with them the past 3 years.As someone who purchases no less than 30-40 PAGES of orders each year that's not too bad.But they should have given us warning, something."
B008F9SM0S I didn't watch it back then, likely something conflicted in the time slot, and we didn't have that much ability to make up what we missed any old which way.The writing in both seasons is crisp, rapid, and both funny and touching.  The actors are such pros.  Choosing to write Isaac's real life stroke into season two added a layer of depth to the already layered story lines.Worth your time, and with Amazon Prime, it's all free."
B008F9SM0S I never watched Sports Night back when it was actually on television.  I saw it listed under Amazon Prime, and decided to check it out.  The entire series is very entertaining, and I recommend it."
B008F9SM0S Beyond the sports cliches, this is top notch~well directed, written, funny, yet sometimes tackling serious topics.Very fine characters  and acting.by the crew, with the back scenes of producing, and delivering their live sports show. Very well done,  makes the wife and I wish that there were more seasons of this fine show~a real gem!"
B008F9SM0S As Season two unfolds the show tackles some stickier issues and perhaps this detracts slightly from t
B008F9SM0S A taste of what would come from Aaron Sorkin, this show was warm, funny and damned clever.  Such a shame it was canceled so soon--but what was left behind is a gem."
B008F9SM0S I enjoyed the 2nd season just as much as the first! Unfortunately, it took the Kindle for me to watch the show. Dont know how I missed it when it was regular tv"
B008F9SM0S Very literate and creative while still being just plain funny.  They toned down the annoying season 1 dialog in which every statement was answered by a question repeating the statement then the reply was a repeat of the same statement, on and on.  It's still there but not as bad.  I guess the creator thought that was clever.  What really was clever was how the writers created and resolved dilemmas.  This was one of the most fun shows on TV.  I'm glad it's available on Amazon Prime."
B008F9SM0S Sports Night was a seminal show (both seasons).  Though The West Wing rightly gets great praise, this little TV show was Mr. Sorkin's first proof of many of the concepts that would go on to change what was perceived as good TV since.If you liked West Wing for it's good writing and character development/interaction, check this one out."
B008FWHGYS Not much at least, but I didn't get interested in finish it so I guess that says a lot about the movie. The characters didn't make it for me, kind of boring."
B008FWHGYS The rest of the movie is like a roller coaster with engaging stories that juxtapose, spin and circle to completion.  The ending by itself has good and surpising confluences which make it a winner.  From the reviews it appears you either love this film or hate it!  Personally, I liked it!"
B008FWHGYS The tagline for Magnolia Pictures \"360\" is \"Everything comes full circle.\" That's really about the only thing \"360\" has going for it. \"City of God\" director Fernando Meirelles is at the helm with a cast that includes Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Ben Foster, and Anthony Hopkins. The unfortunate thing is these actors really only feel like they're filling a void and don't really make themselves totally useful.\"360\" jumps all over the world; Vienna, Bratislava, Paris, London, Colorado, and finally Phoenix. Seeing how all of the characters connect to one another is really the only drawing factor of the film. You're mostly left feeling like you could've spent a lot more time with certain characters instead of being introduced to so many. Ben Foster is a great example. His character just begins to get interesting when you only see him briefly in montages for the rest of the film. Anthony Hopkins has one really emotional scene during an AA meeting, but mostly feels underused. Jude Law and Rachel Weisz are criminally under-featured. Weisz seems to be rehashing her performance from \"The Deep Blue Sea\" except Rose is a watered down version of Hester Collyer. Meanwhile, Michael Daly (Law) mostly just acts suspicious and then kind of just admits to everything in the long run without much effort. It all just feels so fruitless.How these characters are connected aren't really all that interesting the majority of the time. More often than not, somebody is cheating on somebody else. Aside from Tyler (Foster) and the Older Man (Hopkins), being unfaithful or using sex to make a living is an underlying theme for everyone else. It's just really disappointing. \"360\" initially has this \"21 Grams\" meets \"Closer\" kind of potential and yet isn't nearly as good as either of those films.The drama is edited in a really unique way though. Its execution is a little odd, but is also really intriguing. At certain points in the film, the camera will show several characters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world. So the screen will be divided into four vertical strips that are devoted to one specific character. Later on, during a phone call, the screen is divided into two horizontal strips featuring both individuals on the phone; one in each strip. The most interesting is when Sergei (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) is driving through a tunnel. The lights in the tunnel begin swirling around the screen which eventually transitions to the side of a parked car. It's just a very unusual editing technique.\"360\" feels a bit too overzealous for its own good. While connecting so many characters to one another is extremely impressive on one hand, the characters themselves mostly feel very flat and underdevelop
B008FWHGYS Sophisticated story-telling, encompassing several subjects, their lives, and circumstances is not an easy cinematic feat to accomplish inside of 120 minutes, though \"360\" manages in smooth, easy, dramatic fashion.Serendipity, and Irony intermixed with a bit of mystery, panache, and sex in the hands of a skilled Director, and an All-Star Cast of A-List professional Thespians produces texture woven of soft, and hard tones, controversial lifestyles, haunting issues, near misses, and casual suspense to provide a measure of meaningful entertainment, that will make you think while you're watching it...  --GBJ"
B008FWHGYS Film six unrelated films and film them separately.  Then cross-edit them all with zero continuity or interrelation and you have 360!  The idea is to come full-circle as the title states, but this does not happen here. Most film makers would just say the producers cheated.  The films are not related to each other except at the end, where there is some attempt to correlate crossover. So in watching it, the viewer is constantly wondering when the film is going to make any sense...this never happens, so is disappointing. Filmed in Slovakia, England, France, Vienna and the US we get some international flavor; but this doesn't assist the go-nowhere screenplay or storyline. The weak premise of the film is that opportunities only occur once in a lifetime and so you have to take advantage of them when you can. The screenplay has one basic premise...everyone is with the wrong partner, who they do not love...so it's time to get somebody else! All in all a weak submission, which is more the fault of a non-workable screenplay and storyline than anything else. Just another example of how one weak element in the hundreds it takes to make a film can totally screw the efforts of everyone involved!  Film making is tough!"
B008FWHGYS Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (City of God, Blindness, The Constant Gardner, etc) once again demonstrates how far away from reality his films can take us, but at the same time how closely he can examine human foibles so that rather than being a spectator he involves the viewer into squirming through our own errors of assignations, past, present and future. The screenplay for this extended psychological thriller is by Peter Morgan (Longford, The Queen, Frost/Nixon. The Last King of Scotland, etc) and yet both men attribute the inspiration to Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 play La Ronde which scrutinizes the sexual morals and class ideology of its day through a series of encounters between pairs of characters (shown before or after a sexual encounter). By choosing characters across all levels of society, the play offers social commentary on how sexual contact transgresses boundaries of class. Meirelles and Morgan weave together the stories of an array of people from disparate social backgrounds through their intersecting relationships in locales such as Paris, London, Bratislava, Rio de Janeiro, Denver and Phoenix.The audience must pay full attention to the stories as they unwind as there is a huge cast of characters and most of them, even though briefly at times, are interconnected.  The film opens on Vienna where a photographer is taking stills of a Bratislava girl `Blanca' (Gabriela Marcinkova) who is being molded into a call girl while her hesitant sister observes.  We then see Blanca's first assignment, a British business man (Jude Law) who is thwarted in his pickup by a business rival (Moritz Bleibtreu): the business man is married to Rachel Weisz who in turn is in a torrid affair with a photographer (Juliano Cazarr&eacute;) who in turn is married to a girl in a red beret who works as a dental assistant for a dentist (Jamel Debbouze) who in turn stalks the dental assistant with guilty and unspoken passion. We also meet a young man Tyler (Ben Foster) as he is being released from prison as a sex addict and fears entering the world of women. In an airport in Colorado a gentleman (Anthony Hopkins) still searching for his missing daughter befriends Laura (Maria Flor) and while their flights are delayed Laura meets Tyler and decides to seduce him, but the terrified Tyler cannot navigate through his past guilt and fails to let Laura have her daring passionate way. The coincidences mount with many more substories than these and in the end much comes together back in Vienna when the now practiced call girl Blanca is involved in a one night stand with an exceptionally wealthy and ruthless Russian (Mark Ivanir) whose bodyguard meets Blanca's sister and the two share a friendship that has a surprise ending.This is only a smattering of the characters that populate this mesmerizing story, a story that is at times overwhelmingly confusing but when dissected slowly it produces a sense of awe in the viewer.  This is most assuredly a thinking person's film but one so exquisitely made that it deserves several viewings to grasp all the subtle nuances.  For those willing to commit, this is a brilliant film. In English, French, Russian, Arabic, Ukrainian, and Portuguese with subtitles. Grady Harp, July 12"
B008FWHGYS This is a film about the relationships of people and how they unknowingly are interconnected in ways that in some cases they will never truly understand. The movie jumps from country to country and person to person throughout the storyline and in some way they are all connected with each other and usually it involves a sexual relationship of themselves or their partner.  The film features an all-star cast of international movie stars but even such an honor roll of stars could not save this movie.The movie presentation is choppy and the directing is done in the same manner.  The storyline drags in the first half of the movie and it is 40 minutes before Anthony Hopkins makes his first appearance. After Hopkins shows up the film gets gradually better but still not spectacular.  The script and storyline are just generic and no real plot ever develops during the movie.  It is just bland and the film just seemed flat and uninspired.My wife and I still rated it a 3 star presentation but many people will not like it.  The film was better in the second half but it only raised it from a 1.5 to a 3 star rating.  I am not sure that I can truly recommend this film and if I were you I would rent it and not buy the DVD."
B008FWHGYS Any film with Jude Law and Anthony Hopkins in it can't be bad.  This one consists of a number of vignettes from around the world with a cast of characters who are all interconnected, however tenuously, and are all changed in the end, definitively.  It's an illustration of Lorenz's butterfly effect, in which minuscule actions, like the flapping of a single butterfly's wings, can alter future weather patterns.  In this case, the decisions of individuals affect the lives of others more than they will ever know.  Life is a circle that keeps going 'round and 'round through our own tiny, individual actions.  It's an elegantly philosophical film."
B008FWHGYS *** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY ***In the bar of Budapest's Steigenberger Hotel a handsome British Executive Michael Daly (Jude Law) is staring down into a whiskey as he waits for someone. A Slovakian woman arrives at the bar and orders red wine - dressed well enough to get in but sexily enough to be obviously open for business (a fantastic turn by Lucia Siposova). Just as Michael is about to make a mistake that will threaten his marriage to his beautiful wife Rose (Rachel Weisz) - two smarmy businessmen he'd met with earlier in the day arrive to renegotiate (one of whom is Peter Morgan the writer in a cameo). They notice both Michael and the hooker he was heading towards. As they condescendingly look her up sex ratings on the net - Michael takes a mobile phone call from his tiny daughter at home who wants a dog. In Paris Algerian Jamel Debbouze obsessively follows an employee lady friend from the back seat of a taxi desperately wanting to tell her of his passion - in the USA a tattooed twitchy imprisoned convict about to get out talks to his parole office about his urges towards young girls that he now feels are under control (Ben Foster in a stunning turn)  - a bereaved English father (Anthony Hopkins) meets another stray young lady on a plane and at the airport John worries that she (like his daughter) may become another victim - a brutish but essentially decent Ukrainian driver listens to language CDs in his car as Sergei dreams of better things than the whiplash tongue of his odious boss...The structurally complicated &#34;360&#34; ploughs the same world-citizen territory of 2006's &#34;Babel&#34; with its ten different stories converging on each other and is equally brilliant for it. This is about ordinary people - good people - struggling to do the right thing while one action carried out somewhere else connects them or threatens to derail them in a domino effect. And how in the end - if you're lucky and let go enough - life will come full circle and mostly in a good way...Directed by Fernando Meirelles (&#34;City Of God&#34; and &#34;The Constant Gardener&#34;) from an original screenplay by Peter Morgan (&#34;The Queen&#34; and &#34;The Last King Of Scotland&#34;) - &#34;360&#34; also lets its huge ensemble cast improvise for freshness and cleverly uses split screens to show up to three stories progressing at the same time.Anthony Hopkins and Rachel Weisz attached themselves to the script early on and clearly got the film made - both loving the process (and it shows). Ben Foster and Jude Law are simply the acting icing on the cake. Each is mesmerizing in their wildly different roles - especially Foster whose part is the most creepy difficult to like let alone empathize with (achieves both). Weisz and Hopkins are so beautifully tender too. There's a scene where Rose has a extramarital dalliance with a handsome Brazilian gentleman in a bedroom (when earlier she professed undying devotion to her husband Michael) that is amazing - while Hopkins literally rips your heart out as he explains at a meeting for bereaved parents his newfound wisdom of sorts. &#34;360&#34; features great actors at the top of their game allowed by filmmakers smart enough to let them shine.But while the more famous leads gobble up great writing and parts - what gives &#34;360&#34; its five-star rating is the unknowns who steal the show and give this life's connections overview such bite and reality. Even as a seasoned watcher - you really don't know any of these actors from all different nationalities - and yet they etch their characters into your heart to a point where you're desperate to see them break free from their physical and emotional chains. The ladies in particular are amazing - clearly relishing a generous and humane Director and a writer with a big heart and a sharp eye. But special mention must go to Vladimir Vdovichenkov (Russian) and Gabriella Marcinkova (Czechoslovakian) as the chauffeur and aimless daughter who may leave their sordid worlds behind and literally drive away to new lives...The BLU RAY picture is defaulted to 2:35.1 so has bars above and below - but even with stretching to 16 x 9 full screen - gives a beautiful picture (the cinematography relishing Vienna, Budapest and Paris in the Winter). Other moments are less defined especially the indoor shots of sleazy photo labs and hotel rooms - filmed with an on-the-go grittiness that's in keeping with the story. The master audio is 5.1 DTS with English Subtitles. The extras include a short interview with Brazilian Director Fernando Meirelles about the making of the film (financing, plot lines etc.) and interviews with the actors including the 4 principal leads and the Producer Andrew Eaton and Writer Peter Morgan.Rich in observations and wisdom - &#34;360&#34; is a fantastic film that will stay with you despite its convoluted structure. And whatever turns you may take in life - make sure you visit this humble little gem somewhere along that thorny way..."
B008FWHGYS This is yet another film with lots of style but a modicum of substance.  It seems that the idea of large ensemble films with several independent plots somehow intersecting at the conclusion is in high gear these days.  Director Fernando Meirelles (City of God) gathers an international cast including Anthony Hopkins, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law, Ben Foster and others to play characters with personal issues, mostly about paired relationships.Michael (Law) hesitantly arranges for a prostitute while on a business trip in Vienna.  His marriage is souring.  His wife (Weisz) is already having an affair with a younger man.  His relationship with his girlfriend ends and she travels home to Brazil with stops in Denver because of a snow storm.  There she meets an older man (Hopkins) looking for his daughter who is about the same age.  She also meets an ex-con (Foster) who is a sex offender.  She decides to shack up with him for the night.I could go on and on but you get the idea.  It would seem the idea here is to keep the audience entertained by showing off some acting excellence. There is one great scene with Hopkins attending an AA meeting that fits the bill.  But we don't get much depth with any of the characters so we don't care much about anyone.  The film really doesn't have much to say.  It's not like everyone's issues are resolved.I'm not sure I understand the title because we don't really end up in the place we started.  To the filmmaker's credit the movie looks good.  With scenes in Vienna, Bratislava, Slovakia, London, Paris and Minneapolis subbing for Denver, the exteriors are nicely presented.  This is certainly not the best film of this style, but not the worst either."
B008FWHGYS I watched this movie twice and liked it better the second time.  It had multiple locations, about four different languages andgood actors.  I find sub-titles diffficult to read, that's why I watched it twice.There was a lot of modern life spanning Europe and a little of USA and all of it about how we relate or not to one another.I loved Ben Foster and Anthony Hopkins as always.  And I also totally enjoyed the prostitute's sister and the gangster's driver.Their time together was most joyous in the whole film.Good acting by all."
B008FWHGYS \"360\" (115 min.) is an ambitious 2011 release, co-produced by different sources and producers in France, Austria, Brazil, the UK and Slovakia. From the get-go we are thrown into convoluted story lines that take place all over Europe and the US. It takes a while to figure out exactly what is happening, but eventually a clear picture emerges. Without spoiling much of the plot line, we follow about half a dozen characters who may or may not eventually interact.Several comments: the movie is shot gorgeously, and in that sense feels as much as a travelogue than it is a \"romantic drama\" (as it was touted in the press in Belgium, where I recently saw this movie in the theater). The main problem with the script and plot (by \"Nixon/Frost\" writer Peter Morgan) is that at no time in the movie did I feel an emotional investment in the characters. Take for example the role of the Brazilian girl Laura (played by Maria Flor), whom we watch getting to know John (played by Anthony Hopkins), but when all is said and done, we do not learn what becomes of Laura when she drops out of sight at some point in the movie. That said, there are several performances worth noting: this movie is the 4th movie in recent months (the others being Dream House, The Deep Blue See, and The Bourne Legacy) starring Rachel Weisz, albeit in a small role, but once again she shines with the limited material she is given. Weisz is in my humble opinion one of the top actresses out there nowadays (along with Michelle Williams). Also very good is Czech actress Gabriela Marcinkova (in the role of Anna), here in her international breakout role, and I can assure you that we have not seen the last of her.In all, this is not a bad movie per se, but unfortunately the script is too muddled to be truly remarkable, as if the various producers wanted to make sure that enough screen time was given to the various countries involved in this production, and the reason I cannot rate \"360\" more than 3.5 stars. Come for the gorgeous scenery, stay for some of the performances, and that's it."
B008FWHGYS I was snowed in one afternoon and rather than do anything productive I elected to watch this film.  To my surprise it held my attention and I confess that I rather enjoyed it.  The story is interesting -- how lives connect and there are lots of great locations: Paris, Vienna, London, the Denver airport in a snowstorm. Many languages are spoken and a certain amount of skin is shown.  People fall in love and leave and switch partners, quit jobs and get fired.  An Imman and a psychiatrist are consulted as well as a call girl.  There's a Russian gangster too --something for almost everyone.  If I sound condescending I have to admit that I sat through the Whole Thing and if I were really honest I'd probably give it four stars.  But I won't because I don't really want to give shoppers the idea that this is a better film than it is.The cast is great, though and there are a few genuinely moving moments in the segment with Anthony Hopkins as a man searching for his missing daughter.  Jude Law is always exquisite and the rest of the cast is very good.  If you don't expect high art or you're snowed in you might enjoy this film."
B008FWHGYS 360(released July/12) stars Sir Anthony Hopkins,Jude Law,Rachel Weisz and many others.It's a well done filmic study in characters whose paths are linked either directly or indirectly,and the differing paths their ultimate decisions take them on.The cast was well picked with all doing a solid job.The story starts off with a young European lady at a photog's place of business.The man is really a photog/pimp.He puts up clients photos on the internet,filters the incoming calls and sends his beauties out into the world to make money for himself and them.Her first job as Blanka,is to meet up with Jude Law,a visiting businessman,at a bar.As he walks towards her he is stopped by two businessmen he had talked to previously,who now,of all times,want to accept his offer.Law tells them he is going to deal elsewhere.One of the men spies Blanka and starts to ramble on about her being a hooker,even getting her pic and name on his phone.Law,to avoid embarrassment,has to leave the bar and stand her up.Later that evening in his hotel room,Law gets a call from the businessman who actually met and paid her.She told him Laws name.Their business arrangement will now be renegotiated due to what he has on Law.The scene switches to a dentist who has a thing for his assistant.He seeks help with his emotions with a therapist and his imaan.He even goes so far as to follow her to the airport.Law's wife,in the meantime,has had an on going affair with a young Brazilian photog who works for her company.Today she is having one last fling with him and ending her affair.The photog goes home only to find HIS Brazilian girlfriend has left him because of his affair with Law's wife.She flies back to Rio.Law returns home and both he and his wife are uncomfortable because of their individual personal problems that neither,of course,know about.The one thing they do have in common at this time is their young daughter.The scene switches to a convicted sex offender and his case worker.Seems the six year jailed convict is being allowed out and is flying home by himself.He is quite uncomfortable with the prospect,but his case worker is there for him.On a flight over the U.S.,the Brazilian girl on her way to Rio meets up with elderly Hopkins.It turns out he is a recovering alcoholic and is going to Arizona to identify a body which may or may not be his daughter,who disappeared some years before.Stranded at Denver Airport due a snowstorm,the two decide to meet up later for a drink at a bar.Fate intervenes and she instead meets up with the convicted sex criminal.She ends up coercing him back to her hotel room,and he is clearly uncomfortable.Her advances drive him to lock himself in the washroom.When he finally comes out she is asleep.Hopkins,the next day,worried seeks the girl out when her flight is boarding.He finds her and they say their goodbyes.Hopkins gets to his destination and finds the body is not his daughters.At an AA meeting that night he relates the background of his daughters disappearance(she may be alive).Also at that AA meeting is the dental assistant who is there visiting relatives.It seems her marriage is on the rocks and when she returns home she is telling her hubby it is all over.This she does,and just as he is leaving on a business trip.When she returns to work her conflicted boss tells her he has to let her go.Her hubby meanwhile has gone to the airport to meet his boss,who has some crime connections and is in town to to meet up with a girl he has lined up for him.It turns out the girl is none other than Blanka,but things don't go well.She calls her pimp who arrives and shoots the man,leaving Blanka at the scene unconscious.The hubby has watched things go down and flees the scene.Blanka's sister,who went along to every job with Blanka,had struck up a convo with the hubby earlier,and now decides to leave with him.Law's marriage has now recovered.And the film comes to its conclusion as we see all the major characters go across the screen,all on the new paths they have chosen/made for themselves.The last character study I recently saw was the Marigold Hotel,but unlike that,this one has its stars,but not to the same extent.Marigold's characters lives converged at the hotel,but here we have people from all over the world coming together in some way,shape or form,with some strand of commonality.I also found this movie far more satisfying than Marigold.The direction here is quite good,as is the editing to get all these divergent stories together to make a whole,coherent story.They also \"play\" with us a bit in this film.There is a moment when the sex offender is alone in the room with the girl flying to Rio.She is asleep and he is gently stroking her.The camera fades into next day and Hopkins is looking for her to say goodbye.We don't expect he will find her but he does.No,the violent moment is put off until Blanka sleeps with the criminal and it goes wrong.Nicely played.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.All in all a nicely done character study;well acted and directed.Recommended."
B008FWHGYS This wasn't my kind of movie at all.  I ended up turning it off before I was one third through."
B008FWHGYS I imagine this is titled 360 because \"Ring\" and \"It's a Small World\" were already taken. 360 involves a number of disjointed stories that have a way of intersecting or not. There are many indie films out there that do this, some work better than others. The ones that work have quirky stories that hold our interest. This one does not. The stories consist of an escort, infidelity, a sex offender, a man looking for his missing daughter, and a Russian. There may be a few more.The Denver airport was filmed in Minnesota, apparently they figured no one travels enough to either place to notice. While the acting wasn't bad, the stories were presented in a mundane fashion. One of the problems with the film is that you know in advance the story will circle back so you spend your time concentrating on how it is going to do that rather than try to take in what is on the screen.If you like intersecting indie films, try Jason Freeland's \"Garden Party\" a modest production which I enjoyed more than this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity. It had some of each, but really didn't dwell on it."
B008FWHGYS When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match.  This didn't come close.  It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc.  But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much.  The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking.  Why did I waste the time.  A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc.  B
B008FWHGYS I especially liked the cast on this movie, it was an unusual different story line with a surprise (?) ending."
B008FWHGYS \"A wise man once said if there's a fork in the road take it.\" This is amovie that deals with many different characters from different parts ofthe world from different social classes and how they deal with day today problems from doing anything to earn money to getting strandedwhile traveling. The cast in this, which includes: Rachel Weisz, JudeLaw, Anthony Hopkins and Ben Foster is great and honestly the cast isthe best part of the movie. I used to think that a great castautomatically means that it will be a great movie, but after the last 4or 5 movies I have seen based off the cast I am beginning to rethink myopinion. The acting is great in this and the story lines basically endup being tied together I guess but the movie is just so slow movingthat it makes it really hard to stay interested in. The movie is prettyOK but for me this is another example of a great cast in a sub-parmovie. Overall, very slow moving drama that is really only worth seeingbecause of the cast. I give it a C+."
B008FWHGYS I did not like the film because the negative seemed to overpower everything else.  There are digusting, illicit, and unscrupulous things that take place.  See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com."
B008FWHMMO Louis CK has been at the top of his game lately. This show is just one example. Also I relate strongly to his middle aged angst. Many of the stories seem to be about me. Not common in today's media."
B008FWHMMO This just won an emmy and that finally provoked me into watching it. Before this, a series based on this burly stand up comic simply did not entice me. It has taken a few episodes for me to warm up to this but I must admit that he hits at least one big essential truth in each episode. The comedy is dark.  He is less likely to have a good relationship than Jerry Seinfeld as his stand up series character, which is saying something.In this first episode the woman he is currently seeing figures out he wants to break up and basically does all the hard work for him. As she keeps doing everything for him, you realize how inept he is at relationships. Then in other episodes we see him make behavioral zig zags just because someone says he might be gay.  He isn't but he talks in his stand up comedy act about how straight men will go to almost any lengths to prove they are not gay whereas women could care less about whether someone thinks they are a lesbian.  He makes his case very believably and I did not previously realize how true this was.His daughters ask why he doesn't have a girlfriend and very shortly he is scouting for a girlfriend he can introduce them to at a dinner.  He ends up with a bookstore owner who on the first date proves to be the craziest woman he has every dated. This is played very well by Parker Posey.this show can stand on its own among the sitcom like of SEINFELD and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, which is high praise indeed."
B008FWHMMO Not to many shows make me feel heart warmed and awkward at the same time. The \"asking out\" scene pays off so well at the end. Really enjoying this season!"
B008FWHMMO As with his other seasons, Louie leaves us hangin' what will happen in the future...let's hope he changes his mind about an extended layoff before new material is produced."
B008FWHMMO All through seasons one, two, and three I stayed enchanted with Louie. I got all excited when I viewed the 3 part series about him being up for the David Letterman slot. What a refreshing choice if he would really  consider that. I would be first in line to see every show...can only imagine the questions his guests would be confronted with. GO FOR IT, LOUIE C.K.!!! I'll be waiting to buy  your season 4,  but wish you would think about throwing in your hat for the late night gig! A loyal fan."
B008FWHMMO This comedy series has improved over time.  Less of the stand up and more heart felt sketch comedy about a middle aged man dealing with the vagaries of life."
B008FWHMMO Love every episode of \"Louie.\" New Year's Eve made me sad and made me laugh. Louie CK is a great writer, director, and actor."
B008FWHMMO Louie Season 3 is better than ever and that's a pretty high standard given the fact that seasons 1 & 2 were terrific.  In season 3, Louie seems to be exploring some of his issues (and old demons).  He also begins a relationship with a woman who does not speak english.  Louie is also shot in a &#34;Woody Allen&#34; style depiciting NYC at it's most beautiful.Highly recommend to anyone.  Plus, his stand-up sets are the best!"
B008FWHMMO In this episode we get to meet Louis ex-wife, she's hot, sexually and socially active and is played by an African American- what's that supposed to mean? She's earthy, no-nonsense, and cool?Meanwhile Louis' almost significant other also has his number.  She realizes what is going on even before he does and makes everything so easy for him, including avoiding unnecessary heartbreak.Loved the whole motorcycle bit, the look the salesman gives him when he says, \"So buying a motorcyle is the smart thing to do?\"\"What about Obama?!\" the old lady patient cries out, so true, so sad. I should know I live in SW Fla. God's waiting room."
B008FWHMMO This is a great comedy show.  I love the comedy and actors.  I look forward to the new stuff Louise CK has coming out real soon. He is one unique guy this Louis CK and could hold his own on a Tonight Show.  This is definately an adult comedy show.  It really grows on you.....I think you'll like it."
B008FWHMMO I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I fine this series not funny at all. It's full of talk of oral sex and stupidity. If I could, I'd get my money back. Don't waste your time or money"
B008FWHMMO This show is unlike anything else on TV. Louis C.K. not only makes you laugh, he makes you think and he makes you uncomfortable sometimes."
B008GJVAW4 Really fascinating to hear Jobs explain what the internet would become in this 1995 interview. His forecast is precisely what the internet has become in 2014."
B008GJVAW4 His enthusiasm is contagious.  He seems to see the good and the potential in others.  Yet he always has his purpose, a big goal to achieve.At the time of this interview, he could not have known he would quickly take over Apple and turn it into America's most successful company.  I would have loved working with him, I think."
B008GJVAW4 This was an extraordinary interview, and to put my opinion in perspective, I have never nor will ever own an Apple product in my life. That's just how personal and revealing this interview was. Genius.The most fascinating aspect of the interview was seeing the seeds in the mid 90's that would eventually germinate into modern day Apple. For example:1) Steve's focus on product over process ensured that quality and user experience was never compromised.2) The sadness he felt when he said Apple was being destroyed led to the cash hoard the buoyed the stock during the great recession3) Steve's love of the liberal arts and admission that Microsoft has 'no taste' led to artful devices4) It only seems natural that after his hacking into phones as a child, his mission to alter humanity was executed through a phone5) His belief that for every hardware hobbyist, there were 1000 hobbyists that would prefer the Apple 1 hardware pre assembled led to the development of the ecosystem and Apple telling consumers what they need rather than the converse6) His divestiture of control that ultimately led to his firing from Apple was recouped in a 'Top-Down' leadership style for his next tenure there7) NeXt and Steve's exposure to the internet and software led him to make comments in the tail end of the interview that proved to be very true regarding e-commerce, free thought, and the experience of communicating...5 years before the dot com boom8) Steve's mastery of factories, tooling, and understanding the process from idea to product led to a vertically integrated Apple9) His witness of the failure of Xerox to capture the entire computing market when they had a chance led to Steve's focus on hiring and promoting highly skilled employees rather than generalists10) Steve's own admissions of mistakes he made, while candid, were ultimately too painful for him to share. Some mistakes were even irreversible; this is a man whose passions and brilliance ultimately allowed the world to experience life as it never has before, at the cost of his own.I highly recommend every employee, CEO, investor, consumer, passionate soul out there watch this modest yet powerful interview. 5 stars. RIP Steve Jobs"
B008GJVAW4 Did not know much about him.Now know some insight on how he was thinking in 1994 working at Next(sp?) in between Apple and Apple."
B008GJVAW4 In my opinion I have the best opinions in this world.In my opinion I know value and quality when I see it.This interview was easily the best interview of any human ever recorded.  Not because of the questions (which were good), but because Steve Jobs shows us in under 80 minutes why he was the most inspired man of the computer age.I will be hard pressed to ever give 5 stars again because for any movie or book on Amazon to measure up to this it would be a masterpiece.Anything less than 5 stars for this show is ignorant, being the 12th reviewer I plan on returning to see if anyone has a beef with this and why, because to me it was awesome and very very inspiring."
B008GJVAW4 So much of what was talked about in this interview brought back wonderful memories of what the tech life was like before the internet. I had forgotten how quickly all this happened."
B008GJVAW4 Very few video records exist that capture the genius and charisma of Steve Jobs, this is one of those rare artifacts."
B008GJVAW4 Thank you luck,charma,a diety that this gem was found! I always found him amazing creating what my mind had so wished and longed for! I loved computers I was an 80s computer fanatic! War Games the movie was our way of life with our magical gift! This interview grabbed me and held onto me throughout! I hated the end nearing. His passing Devastated me, I cant even think about it now! As I state I am so grateful for this in depth truthful interview that explained his genius and a part of the reason we were blessed to have him on the earth with us and for our generations oh so far ahead. Listening to him predict just a few years from the interview he was ahead even then! I hope his A TEAM keep hiring As to continue the best they can with his vision and legacy! The Jobs children You are blessed to have a piece of him genetically or just in complete unconditional love. I would say rest in peace  but that wouldn't be the Steve we know and loved! He's just as busy some how! I am not a religious person so this is from my heart and my Quantum/theoretical physical mind!"
B008GQW1CU I learned some, but not much. Did not even show the crown jewels in the episode on the Queen's possessions."
B008GQW1CU If the Queen interests you, this is for you. Lots of good Historical films and facts. Rich in history! Nicely done."
B008GQW1CU This was a rather long, boring, dry, chronicle of the Queen of England. Maybe the folks in the UK enjoy it."
B008GQW1CU It was great.  The Queen was or is a great lady."
B008GQW1CU If you're an anglophile, with Monarchist's leanings, you should enjoy this 4-part series.  Each part is about 50 minutes and covers a different aspect of Queen Elizabeth's life. The film is called QUEEN & COUNTRY and it's almost as much about Britain as the Queen.  The first episode is devoted to her life in London.  What if Prince Charles decides to move the court to Windsor Castle when he becomes King?  London seems an integral part of royal life.The next episode covers her diary, or schedule, for the year.  You accompany her to Scotland and Liverpool.  There's original footage of the Queen when she was newly crowned.  You see how vivacious and charming she was as a young Queen.  She was still dignified and classy, but definitely less reserved.  The last two episodes cover her possessions and overseas travels, even at the spry age of 85.Trevor McDonald narrates this but there are other experts on the royalty who speak.  All are clearly enthusiastic about the Queen.  You do come away with renewed respect on her devotion to her duties and love for England.  It's amazing she has been able to keep up the discipline of such a structured life.  For anglophiles, this is a visual treat."
B008GQW1CU This didn't hold my interest like I thought it would.  I was hoping for more intimate scenes of family and her life.  I'd have love to have seen more footage and photos of her that were not part of the 'official' record.  I'd love to know what it is like, what she thinks of her job, what goes on behind the curtain... so to speak.  I do love the British Monarchy and I think it should remain.  There is a mystique and maybe that is a good thing... but we are all so curious.  What's it like to be a kid in a huge castle!"
B008GQW1CU Love the way it spans the topic. Wish there was more that I could add to my queue. I would add them in a second!"
B008HBEJOW Ha ha ha, this show is a filler of major turkey proportions. At least judging by this episode, in which Ozzy Osbourne's son (of all people) is trying to find a Skin-walker (a shape-shifting demon in Native American mythology), while some of his colleagues are on the lookout for the Ozark Howler, apparently a demon feline of some sort.Bad acting, extended scenes in complete darkness or the multi-coloured chaos of a thermal camera, and absolutely no action whatsoever - that seems to be the concept behind \"Haunted highway\". The investigators come across as super-gullible, at one point confusing the Ozark Howler (which is supposedly the size of a cougar) with a racoon or possum!Sure, it's an entertainment show, but I admit I wasn't. Entertained, that is. Judging by the Youtube comments, the average viewer of \"Haunted highway\" is a 15-year old sexually starved boy with a bad crush on Dana, Ozzy Junior's female (feline?) assistant. I admit *that* was pretty entertaining. And yes, it *is* somewhat strange that both Dana and Devin can keep their make-up on after two days chasing monsters in the wilderness...OK, let me guess. This show is...scripted?Sorry, this episode only gets one star - and I doubt the search for the El Dorado Hell Hounds or Louisiana Swamp Woman get much better than this. Besides, I doubt the Swamp Woman can beat Dana & Devin's make up, LOL.This is a real \"ghost turkey\"."
B008HBEJOW HAUNTED HIGHWAY (Prod. Jack Osbourne) is laughable. When they first hyped this show--when was that, 2011?--I expected an honest-to-goodness travel documentary of investigative journalism. Something which, as we all know, does not exist in paranormal shows or else they'd cease to be paranormal.Lately this show has been starring only Devin Marble and Jael De Pardo, both notoriously awful B-movie bit-players (Jack had to go off the show for a while due to an MS diagnosis). While Devin is something of a producer as well as an \"actor\", both of these clods were so much more fun when they were doing FACT OR FAKED. That was a show I liked because they made strenuous efforts to debunk everything.HAUNTED HIGHWAY is the reverse. Osbourne, or whoever conceived of this smelly gym sock, was clearly not serious about anything at all. It always, and I mean ALWAYS, has the air of a cruddy C-list horror flick made in someone's backyard. In fact it often looks as if they are shooting in a backyard in California. And as I said, since the show has been reduced lately to Devin and Jael, well, the horrifically bad acting and scripted \"investigations\" get funnier and worse with each minute.If I have to see Devin fall on his butt into the water one more time, or hear Jael's blood-curdling (totally phony) screams at every little creak, I'm going to stop watching this altogether. Come on, people! There are real intrigues and locations to be checked out, we don't need these two zombies who think they have creds because they did FACT OR FAKED for a couple of years.However, I would like to take the opportunity to wish Jack Osbourne a good-health future. MS is a nasty bugger, which I know from my own experience. All the more reason for Osbourne to get serious if he wants to produce an outstanding, quality show. HIGHWAY is worse than any other show I can imagine.--SOAPBOX TIME--What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are \"reality\"--in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. It is very simple.Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it and they were not trying to deceive their audiences. Even then, I recall it caused a national stink in both cases, and both those great men were in a little hot water for a time. Perkins then Cousteau invented and perfected the reality-documentary-show genre. Pity they did not invent the \"ghost-hunter\" genre; it would have made the standard much higher.The true problem is, we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside--has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.That disclaimer has words to the effect that the shows are \"for entertainment purposes only\", and as if that weren't weighty enough, there also has to be some disclaimer that the shows are faked, partially faked, or partly reenacted as applicable. To what purpose goes such a law, you ask?--to let us know what has been faked and what is real, and NO, you can't say fakery is part of reality so it is \"real\" too. That stupid straw man argument has been used for over 20 years and I'm ashamed of anyone who says such a thing.For an excellent example of the right way to avoid fraud accusations, see the disclaimer on Ernie \"Turtleman\" Brown's excellent show,Call of the Wildman: Season 1--see my reviews. I can't recall it verbatim but it states pretty clearly that parts of the show were recreated/reenacted for dramatic purposes.Honestly, why haven't these networks or at least the producers been brought to heel for this major offense?!"
B008HBEJOW The show is entertaining, story, writing and acting are fantastic!Each episode is riveting and never fails to keep you watching."
B008HBEJOW While I have only watched a few episodes it is a well done show by Investigators who all a have experience from others show such as Destination truth and Fact or Fake, it is shot in a style somewhat like the Ghost Adventures with a touch of the Blair witch project tossed in.  The investigations are new and fresh not just rehashing of the same subjects seen on other shows.  For the price it is worth watching.  If you like myself are an aficionado of the genre then it is worth a watch."
B008HBEJOW This show is a fresh way to go paranormal hunting. I have watched two seasons and have enjoyed each show."
B008HBEJOW I like this show, though it is pretty low budget. The hosts show bravery in investigating many of these paranormal entities and creatures."
B008HNQ0OW Why Stop Now is mostly a comedy that begins on such a promising note before eventually falling apart.  I can't help but feel the writers missed the boat and didn't know how to wrap up the film with a satisfying conclusion.When an expert piano player (played by Jesse Eisenberg) takes his mother to a drug rehabilitation center, it's discovered that his moms urine is unusually clean so... in order to be granted permission into the drug center, she has to come up with a way to get drugs into her system and taint her urine, lol.  That's pretty funny!  So, she gets Jesse involved in a drug obtaining scheme that initially involves wearing a disguise costume and pretending to be a drug addict himself looking for a quick fix, but this quickly turns into an entirely different matter as one offbeat situation after another develops, and the drug dealers discover they're being visited by Jesse for other reasons.However, because Jesse knows the Spanish language, the drug dealers drag Jesse (and his mom) to a restaurant where a secret meeting with *other* drug dealers concerning high-priced drugs takes place.  The conversation we see here between Jesse and the drug dealers (the African American and the Spanish guy sitting at the table) is the best moment of writing in the entire movie for me.  Loved this scene!  Everything seems so promising up to this point until... well, eventually the storyline fizzles out.  The strength of this storyline clearly should have been on the drug dealers because the oddball and unrealistic relationship they develop with Jesse and his mother as they travel around town is easily the high point of the storytelling, however it all goes to waste shortly after this scene.Jesse has a crush on a girl at school and through an unusual reenactment involving the Civil War, they get to know each other better with each segment.  This is honestly a pretty boring aspect of the film, and I see no reason why it should have even been included.  Also Jesse's younger sister has a puppet addiction, so much so that the teacher asks Jesse to make her stop and communicate with her classmates normally.  This is another \"Why is this even part of the story?\" moment.  Only when the drug dealers and the little girl have a little argument over the puppet does it reach a brief moment of being enticing.At least Jesse's mom is believable in her drug addiction role, and Jesse's emotions when dropping her off at the drug rehab center are EXCELLENT!  Really strong, forceful and believable emotions revealing the frustration he's feeling that his mom won't quit taking drugs.  She's obviously reached a point of addiction that she needs to end it as soon as possible by any means necessary.  Still, there should have been more involvement with the drug dealers, Jesse and his mom.  The moments where Jesse's playing the piano during an audition and revealing his amazing talents are pretty good, but nothing great (except the one where he's bleeding- you'll see what I mean when (if) you watch Why Stop Now).  Another memorable part comes when Jesse calls his mom's sister pretentious because of the way she acts.  Shortly after this scene Jesse plays a really good song on the piano- loved the song he was playing but don't know the name of it.I think Why Stop Now being so short is the biggest problem.  The storyline needed more time to fully develop and stretch out the comedy segments becaues as it stands, it feels severely lacking.  Not a bad film though.  Worth 80 minutes of your time."
B008HNQ0OW Heartfelt family drama or wacky screwball road trip? The new film \"Why Stop Now?\" tries to combine these two disparate genres. The end result is a chaotic scramble that is at its most successful when it quiets down and trusts its characters. The film boasts A-list talent like Melissa Leo and Jesse Eisenberg, here playing mother and son. Epitomizing the frustrations of a deeply troubled family unit, the two actually have a fair number of effective and emotional scenes. There is an underlying truth to the central story that is easy to identify with. But this is not intended to be a serious study of dysfunction and addiction, the screenplay also wants to take us on a ribald and outrageous journey. Personally, I think that sounds like a fine idea. The problem is that these scenes severely clash with the more nuanced moments. I won't deny that \"Why Stop Now?\" made me smile at a few of its sillier situations, but this might be a case of trying too hard! Instead of clever dialogue or amusing writing, every member of the cast simply ups the volume on their performance for the comedy bits. And louder does not make anything more funny. The actors are game and committed, the screenplay just doesn't back them up.Eisenberg plays a piano prodigy going to the biggest audition of his life. This happens to coincide with the day that Leo is going to enter a rehabilitation facility for her on-going drug problem. As the responsible member of the family, Eisenberg is nearly cracking under the pressure especially when considering the options for his future. The audition might be his escape, if only he can get his mom to step up to the plate for his younger sister. An unexpected turn at the treatment program, however, derails their whole day. Soon the pair will be screaming (literally) their way around town for a series of increasingly perplexing adventures. Joining a friendly dealer Tracy Morgan (he's more bark than bite), the day includes war reenactments, a quinceanera, and more family bickering than on a season of your favorite sitcom. Can Eisenberg pull it together? And with everything else going on, is this really the best time to court romance? The film is jam packed and overstuffed. Unfortunately, though, as much of the humor falls flat as hits its mark.Leo, as always, is a great actress. She does have a tendency to go big, and I prefer her more grounded and realistic. Her performance wavers between sublime and grating. Anytime the cast gets into the car, for example, you know that much shouting will ensue and whoever is driving will veer around like a mad man or woman. This happens several times and is never particularly humorous. Eisenberg is more consistently believable, although the film never digs beneath the surface of his character. Morgan is fine and Isiah Whitlock Jr (as Morgan's brother and muscle) ends up my favorite character because he never plays to the rafters with an oversized performance. There is plenty to like in \"Why Stop Now?\" and if you're a fan of either of the leads, you might want to check this out. However, the picture never came together as a cohesive whole for me. I ended up liking some of the drama, but the chaotic madness never quite worked for my taste. KGHarris, 12/12."
B008HNQ0OW Pretty much everything.  Comedies these days tend to rely mainly on cheap tricks and superficial gimmicks, rather than truth.  True conflicts that resonate in the human heart.  True tragedies that are seen daily.  True humor that needs no crutches in profanity (even if it doesn't shy away from using it) but stands on its own based in human nature and solid acting.Why stop now?  Because this review has said everything you need to know.Well besides the fact that the acting blew my mind.  And the casting.  And the script.Alright. Haha"
B008HNQ0OW Social outcast and bad drinker Eli( Jesse Eisenberg) works as a stock boy but aspires to go to a prestigious arts college. His former teacher Dave (Neal Huff) has managed to arrange an audition for him. On the morning of the audition, Eli attempts to quickly straighten out a home life that has always teetered on disaster. His sister Nicole (Emma Rayne Lyle) talks to people through a foul mouthed sock puppet that needs to be laundered. His waitress mother (Melissa Leo) needs to go to rehab. However things don't go as planned.Rehab won't accept Eli's mother Penny because her urine is currently clean and she doesn't have insurance. They suggest she do drugs to dirty up her urine. Eli aids and abets his mother on her quest. He runs into the likes of drug dealer \"Sprinkles\" (Tracy Morgan). At this point the comedy kicks into gear. Eli ends up as a translator between Sprinkles and his Spanish speaking connection.The film has some comedy scenes, most notable when Tracy Morgan is involved, but for the most part it is a drama that involves people with some type of problem which can be argued that they center around Penny's addiction. It is not a dark comedy per se, the comedy is not about dark material.Eli's attraction for Chloe (Sarah Ramos) didn't seem to be well developed. Tracy Morgan as a drug dealer and his sidekick Black (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) lacked credibility in those roles as they were comically written while the other characters were more serious. It is a feel good movie, but not one that will make you hold your side with laughter.Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
B008HNQ0OW \"Why Stop Now\" is a comedy-drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life-changing adventure.  Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).  Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product, Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets.  A series of comic misadventures ensues, perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible.  The cast is in top form, however, though each of the principals has been showcased far better in other projects.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, interview with Tracy Morgan, and theatrical trailer."
B008HNQ0OW \"You're telling me to go out and get high so that I can get into rehab?\" Eli (Eisenberg) has his life worked out. He has an audition to get into an elite music school, he wants his mother (Leo) to get into rehab so she can take care of his sister without him worrying. Once she is out and sober he can leave and not worry. They only problem is that his mom's test came back clean, so they need to get her high in order for her to get into rehab...sounds easy. First off this movie is not bad and it is a comedy, but not really a laugh out loud comedy. The idea itself is pretty funny and the writing is pretty clever. Jesse Eisenberg is turning into an actor who plays the same character over and over, but he is good at playing this type of kid. The mov
B008HZEJ5W Not very funny movie.  Glad it was free. That's what it was worth.  If not for Chris Rock, 2 stars."
B008HZEJ5W Chris Rock's facial expressions are worth watching in this somewhat overlooked little gem that sends up US attitudes toward the French. Julie Delpy is surprisingly funny, too, as the French girlfriend caught in the middle as her dysfunctional French family spends a couple days in NYC. Many funny moments throughout. Absurdity is t
B008HZEJ5W Well, I now know once Woody Allen dies, Julie Delpy can take over. Is that a good thing? Nothing wrong with Delpy as an actress but, honestly, 40 odd minutes into this one I gave up. Oh, I left it running till the end but I just flat-out did not care about these characters. The cast are quite the cast of characters but I found I was not laughing nor remotely interested in these self-involved idiots. In fact, I could sympathize totally with Chris Rock's character wanting to go into his home office and check the heck out of this movie.The extras--sorry, I had no patience to sit through them after wasting time on the actual movie. I'll let some other fool give them a shot here."
B008HZEJ5W It isn't required viewing to see Julie Delpy's 2007 film \"2 Days in Paris\" before diving into 2012's \"2 Days in New York\" to fully grasp or understand what occurs in the romantic comedy sequel, but it would more than likely help you appreciate \"2 Days in New York\" a bit more. However, \"2 Days in New York\" doesn't leave you with this overwhelming sensation to view or revisit its predecessor either. The film leaves you feeling like secluding yourself from your family and any sort of responsibility would be the absolute best thing for you when things get really hectic.This movie makes it seem like living in New York leaves you with no time to do anything ever. Maybe all of this was supposed to be funny; family members who don't know English getting away with things no normal person can just because they're from another country and being too busy to be intimate with the one you love despite talking about it all the time. It just felt sad and kind of pathetic. There's a huge emphasis on language barriers, ignorant racial jokes that are pretty preposterous, and how a simple thing like buying drugs in front of a child can really impact them. Most of the humor seems like it's stripped away for a last ditch effort just to stay on top of an already sinking ship. It's emotionally exhausting more than anything.Chris Rock is surprisingly the best part here. He really breaks away from whatever comedy he has associated himself with in the past and brings logic and reason to an already well developed character. The highlight of the movie is his scenes where he has full-blown conversations with a cardboard cut-out of Barack Obama. The whole brain tumor thing and what it leads to is amusing as well as is when Marion takes Rose to her yoga class. One of Marion's art pieces is a contract for the selling of her soul, which results in this quest for Marion where she's just searching to find herself again. It's very reminiscent of when Bart sells his soul on \"The Simpsons.\"\"2 Days in New York\" just leaves you feeling drained. Its conclusion feels extremely clich&eacute;, as well. Not only could the movie have ended nearly 45-minutes beforehand, but it's something so simple that always seems to happen in movies containing this plot device. It's like shaking a Magic-8 Ball and getting an \"Ask again later\" type of response. Having too much on your plate and its inevitable consequences outweigh the laughs here. Even though Chris Rock is fairly impressive here, \"2 Days in New York\" is a frustrating attempt at romance that isn't overly amusing or charming."
B008HZEJ5W A good independent film which was well cast. The comedy is reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie. I found this film very entertaining and would suggest it to anyone who wants to watch a fun heartwarming movie."
B008HZEJ5W I really like this movie, but being from New York City I'm probably a little biased.  It is a pleasant, quirky little film for a rainy Sunday afternoon with a friend.  Chris Rock was very good and Ms. Delpy was charmingly erratic.  The other players were good with the help of several actors you will recognize from \"Law and Order\" and some television sitcoms.  Very good it made me laugh."
B008HZEJ5W I chose to watch this because I typically like Chris Rock and I was hoping for a movie that was light and funny. This movie was more \"artsy\" and that's not my style so this movie just didn't work for me."
B008HZEJ5W Julie Delpy really has a good ear for shrewdly observational, overlapping conversations. It started with her Richard Linklater-directed bookends, 1995'sBefore Sunriseand 2004'sBefore Sunset, in which she and Ethan Hawke contributed much of their own dialogue (and earned adapted screenplay Oscar nominations for the latter). She then translated her unique gift to her own sophomore directorial effort, 2007's2 Days in Paris, a romantic dramedy that mined her character's repressed hesitancies about settling down with a neurotic, irritating interior decorator named Jack. Delpy comes back again as the star, director, and writer (this time partnering with co-star Alexia Landeau, who plays her sister Rose) of this 2012 sequel, a culture clash comedy paced like a free-for-all French farce. Although the results are not always fortuitous, her aptitude as a filmmaker has clearly improved since Paris, this time aided by a far more likable leading man, an atypically subdued Chris Rock versus the insufferable Adam Goldberg who is blessedly absent from this film.Delpy herself plays the same character, artist Marion Dupr&eacute;, picking up her life in New York a few years after she broke up with Jack, had his baby, and moved in with Mingus, a talk-radio host. Instead of wallowing in commitment issues, Marion is now juggling a busy life raising her towheaded toddler Lulu as well as Mingus' young daughter Willow, and at the same time, getting ready for an exhibit of her photographs at a gallery. Nevertheless, she is still the same intensely self-doubting woman, a Gallic Annie Hall for the millennium with a saucy temperament. Her relationship with the ever-patient Mingus is put to the test when her recently widowed father Jeannot, her passive-aggressive sister Rose, and Rose's clueless, pot-smoking boyfriend Manu all come for a weekend visit. Delpy wisely uses Mingus as the audience's proxy watching her family as exaggerated caricatures of French stereotypes. This is where she shows a genuinely deft hand in presenting everyone's vitriolic, self-absorbed behavior including Marion who is constantly goaded into childishness by Rose's indirect insults. In fact, her family becomes a comical circus sideshow, a constant public embarrassment forcing Marion to tell a whopper of a lie about a phony brain tumor to her nasty neighbors who want her evicted.Where Delpy goes a bit too far is the somewhat surreal part when Marion decides to sell her soul as part of the exhibit and tries to get it back from the Mephistophelian buyer, who is none other than indie filmmaker Vincent Gallo. Using such an extreme plot conceit, she appears to be overreaching on deeper issues of identity and family loss, but the movie eventually recovers its comic rhythm. The puppet show framing device is trite but probably effective for those who had not seen the previous film. As Mingus, Rock grounds the film with his terrifically caustic performance, whether dealing with the next appalling act of his unpredictable in-laws or talking privately to a cardboard cut-out of Obama for spiritual guidance. Albert Delpy, Julie's real-life father, returns as the Bad Santa-like Jeannot and has a grand time portraying his character's whimsical child-like manner. Landeau has a good time playing the selfish sister from hell as Rose, while Alexandre Nahon, who helped with the development of the story, easily plays the boorish interloper that is Manu. Kate Burton and especially Dylan Baker have a few moments to shine as the intrusive neighbors. Delpy's obvious role model continues to be early-period Woody Allen, and she manages to work in his oeuvre with surprising fluidity."
B008HZEJ5W Director/writer/actor Julie Delpy's sequel to \"2 Days in Paris\" follows the same formula but moves the setting to America.  After Marion's (Delpy) previous relationship led her to New York, she had a son (Lulu - really?), divorced and has partnered with Mingus (Chris Rock) who comes with his own daughter.  Marion's dad (real dad Albert Delpy) comes for a visit along with her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) who is unexpectedly accompanied by Manu (Alex Nahon) who was a one time lover of Marion's.Mingus (rhymes with cunnilingus - an ongoing joke) and Marion's apartment is barely big enough for them and the 2 kids.  Still they put up the 3 Parisians.  Dad speaks no English but the other two can get by.  The translation issue comes up primarily with Dad and Mingus and is sometimes funny, sometimes just annoying.  At times I was yelling at the screen, just get someone to translate!  Well then there would be less of a movie.  Delpy is a wonderful writer as she has shown in previous work including \"Before Sunset\" but this movie seems very familiar.  I certainly identified with Mingus and never would have made it as far as he did.  Still, some of the situations are pretty funny and stereotypically French."
B008HZEJ5W well, i was a fan of 2 days in paris, and i thought this was really sweet. it had vincent gallo, always a plus, the cast was great all around. it was a sweet, cute love story with a happy ending, and i needed that tonight. happily recommend if you're having a crappy day and need something fun and cheerful to brighten your spirit. ps, i was in line behind julie delpy at whole foods not too long ago. she's not as crazy as she is in her films. lol."
B008HZEJ5W A few years ago, Julie Delpy directed and acted in her film \"2 Days in Paris\".  This time around, she made another comedy called \"2 Days in New York\".  She stars in this film with great comedian and actor Chris Rock (one of my favorite comedians back from his days on Saturday Night Live).  It is a story of unconventional New York City couple: she is French, he is from Brooklyn.  Both are divirced and have children from previous relationships.  Both of them are artistic, although Julie's character is more \"difficult\" than Chris'.  If that was not complicated enough wait until her famiy comes to visit them in New York from Paris, for the occasion of her art gallery opening.  This gallery opening is not an ordinary show.  One of her pieces is called \"My Soul\" which she is trying to sell for $10,000.This is smart comedy, fast paced, in some ways similar in style to Woody Allen type comedies.  So the reason why this movie has mixed reviews is that not everyone likes intellectual comedies and this one is one of those. I like the film from start to finish.  It is quirky and it tackles at times some unconventional topics.  What is totally amazing is that Julie Delpy wrote the story and screenplay for this film.  She plays the main character and she also directed the movie.  One of the reasons why I think that she is one of the smartest and most talented bi-lingual artists of today.  I cannot think of another woman who can match Delpy with all of her talents.In any case, it is a story of family and it is also a tribute to relationship between two people who are in love with each other.  This is not crazy, young love.  This is the kind of love only grown ups can understand.  I really liked the end when the main character thinks of her recenty deceased mother.  At one moment she says: \"We are all born into families.  Only one day to loose them to death.  And if we are lucky enough, we would have formed a family of our own by then.\"I cannot wait to see Julie Delpy's next project!  I certainly enjoyed this one."
B008HZEJ5W Marion (Julie Delpy) and Mingus (Chris Rock) live in NYC together, each with a child from a previous relationship. They met at &#34;The Village Voice&#34; where Mingus was apparently the token straight guy. Marion is French and is having a photograph exhibit, one depicting the theme of the decline of relationships with age featuring herself and ex laying in bed looking at the ceiling which the critic politely called &#34;mundane.&#34;Her family comes to visit. This includes an over sexed father (Albert Delpy) who believes showers are unnecessary options; her sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) who is her polar opposite and is described as a nymphomaniac who wants to live her sister Marion's life. Rose also brings with her pot head boyfriend Manu (Alexandre Nahon), who by no surprise was Marion's boyfriend at one time although that never really played into the story, other than to establish Rose's character.The film depicts the hectic life which ensues with neither culture understanding the other. Marion must rehash her life with her sister with neither one holding anything back. The film is funny and a dark comedy. Sometimes the drama overshadows the comedic attempt, while at other times the comedy is too predictable. The film uses drug and sex humor in addition to missed translations for its humor base, but builds upon it so it isn't overly immature.Good acting by the cast, even Chris Rock in a role where he is a straight man. Decent script and writing, although some predictable immature scenes such as the changing of the baby with the measuring of his manhood should have been cut (sometimes less is more). The film comes across as a well polished indie and not a typical big screen production.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs (two languages with subtitles) implied sex, nudity (Alexia Landeau)."
B008HZEJ5W \"Ever since your family got here you've become another person.\" Mingus (Rock) and Marion (Delpy) are a married couple trying to make it in New York. Both have a child from a previous marriage and that is a hard enough struggle. When Marion's family visits from Paris tensions begin to tighten to a breaking point between everyone. Mingus wonders if they will be able to last without killing someone. The best way to describe this is as a Woody Allen type movie (Woody had nothing to do with this) but that is the feel that it has. The comedy and humor is very offbeat but funny. The dialog in many places is witty and carries the movie. I have to say that this is a strange movie to see Chris Rock in, he does do a good job though, but it's still weird. The movie is pretty good, but the ending got a little bizarre. This is still basically a movie about crazy in-laws but it is pretty funny and worth seeing. Overall, if you are a fan of Woody Allen then you will probably like this movie. I give it a B-."
B008HZEJ5W \"2 Days in New York,\" a nominal sequel to \"2 Days in Paris,\" stars Julie Delpy (who also directs and co-writes) as Marion, an artists and mother of one child now living in a Manhattan apartment with a talk-radio host Mingus (Chris Rock). One day Marion's family members, her father Jeannot (Julie Delpy's real-life father Albert Delpy) and sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) with her sister's boyfriend Manu (Alexandre Nahon) travel from France and stay with them for two-day vacation, disrupting their hitherto happy home.Chris Rock is surprisingly good as a \"comic foil,\" a (comparatively) level-headed person providing opportunities for other characters to be funny, but, let's face it, Delpy as director or actress is not skilled enough to turn the annoying and embarrassing traits of the visitors and the subsequent situations into a comedy.Marion's father is just annoying. Her sister is embarrassing. Her boyfriend is just silly. Don't get me wrong. I know characters can be annoying, embarrassing, silly and very funny, like Diane Keaton in \"Manhattan Murder Mystery.\" But Julie Delpy is no Woody Allen, and Diane Keaton is fun to watch because after all she (and Allen as director) knows what she is doing.So what does Marion want to do? Or Mingus for that matter? With repetitious jokes and so many subplots that go nowhere - with cameos from Dylan Baker, Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Vincent Gallo - \"2 Days in New York\" is a sporadically funny romantic comedy that does not have much of a story to tell, with characters that we really don't care."
B008IYMWYW I liked it ok.  Seems like they were creating drama instead of letting the show be a show. That is it."
B008IYMWYW Let me say that I live near The Great Lakes, they are pretty great! But, if you have see any of those Long John Silver fishing shows, it's the same thing. You may be actually surprised what the Lake Superior North Shore looks like...seriously! Plan a trip"
B008IYMWYW I had no idea that the waters of the Great Lakes could be as challenging and dangerous as Ocean waters.  Very informative."
B008IYMWYW I was interested at first but the language and the same drama as every other boat show out there.  Really lets bring back some history things and let these sink into the water"
B008IYMWYW It just wants so badly to be deadliest catch......and it is just so not deadliest catch. It doesn't take long for you to get REAL SICK AND TIRED of the same darn graphic of a tugboat sinking.*No tugboats or tugboat captains were harmed in the writing of this review."
B008IYMWYW I've lived my whole life in the Great Lakes area in Michigan and Ohio near lakes Erie Huron, and Michigan. I was not aware of the amount of business done on the lakes via shipping and was glad to learn some of the events that take place. I recommend this for the photography and story lines."
B008JAGM6Y Not much more to say but you have to check out tis show if you like this type of genera better than House in my opinion"
B008JAGM6Y I love the story line. The professer is played wonderfully by Eric McCormack. Sad the season ended Looking forward to next year."
B008JAGM6Y I just love it, everyone jells together so well as a cast, and it shows in the production.  The show really makes me think, instead of just being passive about tv like I usually am."
B008JAGM6Y Good theme and acting. Streaming lets you do this as it best fits your schedules. Watch many of the episodes."
B008JAGM6Y This show grabs your interest from the outset. But while you're enjoying each wonderfully thought out show, they're gradually building a larger story that you will feel so much a part of, you will not be able to stop watching!Great series. Eric McCormack and Rachael Leigh are perfectly matched."
B008JAGM6Y Perception is an interesting show because it is includedwith certain shows like The Mentalist, Castle, and NUMB3RS. I enjoy crime shows with special consultants."
B008JAGM6Y I bought the pilot episode and I wasn't buying the lead's quirks.  The trend now in TV is to find flawed lead characters but this guy just wasn't believable.  The season is a Not Buy but based soley on the pilot episode."
B008JAGM6Y I started watching this series late and am still trying to catch up with the shows I am missed in the past.  I love Dr. Pierce and Lewicki and seeing what he deals with on a daily basis with his own mental illnesses helps someone understand the afflictions better.  And of course, how ingenious that the very hallucinations that afflict Dr. Pierce are what guides him through solving cases."
B008JAGM6Y Now that summer is in full swing there aren't many of the fall/winter/spring series that everybody watches so avidly: The Borgias, Game of Thrones, Nurse Jackie, The Hour, Downton Abbey are all on hiatus. Yes, Suits is in a new season, and joining Suits is the very terrific The Newsroom with Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer et al. And now another series that is smartly written and well acted - PERCEPTION.Dr. Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack) is an eccentric neuroscientist who uses his unique outlook to help the federal government solve complex criminal cases. The interesting aspect about Pierce is his perception - he sees people that aren't there, is able to translate anagrams, can sense when someone is lying, etc. He may be schizophrenic but that part of his character isn't clear yet. We can see that he is terrific in the classroom. For his own check on reality he keeps a young student by his side, Arjay Smith as Max Lewicki. He is `visited' by people form his past or his imagination who `aid' him - Colin Cunningham, Kelly Rowan - and is associated with an FBI team that includes Rachel Leigh Cook as Kate Moretti, Christopher Chen, Jonathan Scarfe, etc. Somehow this combination adds to solving insolvable cases.If the writers are able to maintain credibility with Dr Pierce and his idiosyncrasies for a whole season with too much pushing the button, this should prove to be a very watchable season. Worth giving it a chance. Grady Harp, July 12"
B008JAGM6Y This show really grabs me.  I practice psychiatry - and so I do notice some &#34;technical difficulties&#34; with some of what the writers have going on.  But the characters are engaging and sympathetic, and the plots are pretty clever.  Really enjoying this series."
B008JAGM6Y With the world moving so fast now-a-days, we still have inexplicable talents of people that have amazing gifts of perception, intuition, and just have a way of seeing the world around us."
B008JAGM6Y I realized that I had recorded all of season 1 on my DVR and am awaiting Season 2.  It will also be automatically recorded on my DVR and I can also watch it on Dishanywhere."
B008JAGM6Y I enjoy the cases and idea behind this show it is a good watch and am looking forward to season 2"
B008JAGM6Y This show is a little unusual as he is a psychotic person that has invisible friends.  However, once you get past that every thing is cool.  We really enjoy this show.  The show is probably best for some one over the age of 16."
B008JAGM6Y This was truly a really good show.  I bought the DVD and  will donate it to a library.  It wasn't your typical cop show, there was many twists and turns that kept you on the end of your seat to see what was real and what was the hallucination of the main character that has a serious mental problem but trying to work through it on his own without drugs.  Recommend giving it a chance."
B008JAGM6Y this is a great series. i hope they keep it going. It reminds me of a Beautiful Mind which is one of my favorite movies."
B008JAGM6Y Interesting show to watch, but too far fetched for me. I highly doubt that a man who is suffering from active schizophrenia (evident with hallucinations, if not delisions) & is not on medication, would be able to function as a college professor, let alone work with the FBI.  HOWEVER...The show is well organized &, again, interesting to watch. I enjoy the depictions of the main character receiving guidance or counsel from his hallucinations. Also, persons who suffer with schizophrenia do tend to be of high intelligence; so, I appreciate portrayal of the way the main character can solve puzzles that are meaningless to others.--Definitely worth watching!!"
B008JAGM6Y If I wanted to be lectured about the issues of the day I would turn on a police procedural. Entertain me, you are not social, political, economic masterminds. The crazy person being led around by a level headed and dedicated detective has been done before and that's okay but this offers nothing new. If you buy this season I'm sure part of the money will go to the construction of the temple of Obama."
B008JAGM6Y First off let's get something straight right out of the gate--I like and will watch anything Eric McCormack is in, no matter what the material is. The rest of the cast is exceptional for this show as well although I admit at first I rolled my eyes a bit at Rachel Leigh Cook being cast as an FBI agent since my initial impression was that she's just a little too young and fresh-faced to be taken seriously in that role. However, she does such a good job of bringing her character to life that I soon set aside my skepticism and now can't imagine how anyone else could do the role.The plotline of the show is your traditional fish out of water protagonist helps law enforcement catch bad guys in a non-traditional manner. This is a very standard story line that has been done well in shows ranging from Medium to Monk, so in that regard there aren't any real surprises. We all know the protagonist will see things fully-trained law enforcement can't and through a combination of luck, special talents and even the occasional deus ex machina (plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved through the intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object). However, this show takes a new original and yes fresh take on the template so to speak. To that end the plot of the TV show can be summed up as this: Chicago Professor Dr. Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack) is a brilliant neuroscientist who has published four books and now teaches the subject at a local university. A former student of his, FBI Special Agent Kate Moretti, shows up one day telling Dr. Pierce that she's been reassigned to Chicago from D.C. after the higher ups there got annoyed that she tended to not necessarily follow orders. Anyways it turns out Dr. Pierce has acted as a consultant for law enforcement before and Kate enlists her former teacher's help in solving some of the more puzzling cases that she encounters. There is a catch to all of this however, Dr. Pierce is a labeled paranoid schizophrenic who manages his condition primarily with the help of his Boy Friday Teaching Assistant Max Lewicki and talks with his best friend and former love interest Natalie Vincent.Dr. Pierce is definitely a bit paranoid, highly suspicious of all things government and/or modern-living based including microwave meals, full body scans and any political figure including the ones he voted for as \"the lesser of two evils\". We learn that Dr. Pierce had a breakdown when he was still a college student, got diagnosed and became a neuroscientist thanks largely to his fascination with and desire to understand what was happening to him. A manifestation of his illness is that he sees people who aren't there--manifestations and/or hallucinations brought on as his mind grapples with a variety of mysteries and issues that he is struggling to help Agent Moretti resolve. This is the really fun part of this series since neither we or Dr. Pierce always know who is real and who isn't although after you've watched a few episodes you can sort of guess who is a hallucination, especially when it's a historical figure like Joan of Arc or JFK. Nonetheless watching Eric McCormack play someone who knows he's seriously flawed, who himself isn't always sure of what's real or not,  brings a surprisingly touching performance to those in our society who find themselves on the outskirts of \"normal\" society often shunned and feared even when they have done nothing wrong.Dr. Pierce isn't a particularly brave man either, put him in a room where a surprise party is being held and he freezes like a deer caught in headlights and begins franticly searching for a way out of the room. He often clutches a satchel to his chest when he's feeling especially insecure and when things get too overwhelming he retreats to playing classical music on an old casette player and headphones while he air conducts the music to soothe himself and block out noise or situations. He knows he's weird, we know he's weird, the world knows he's weird, but he manages. And truthfully he'd be utterly useless in his work with the FBI or as a teacher except for one thing--when a puzzle is placed before him or he can teach someone something the man simply comes to life. And does so in a way that is so real it makes me wonder who Eric McCormack has hung out with to get his role right. We all know that one person who's an oddball or just a bit mentally not there, but if you put the thing they love most in front of them they change so quickly that you wonder if it's even the same person.The show also shows us something about those who society deems mentally ill--that no matter how far off the grid someone may have appeared to fall they can still be a useful citizen and they are our fellow man. Many of the characters in the show are also, like Dr. Pierce, deemed mentally ill or flawed in some way. Add to that the constant commentary and plots involving today's latest scandals and human rights issues and you have a very compelling TV show for those who like their entertainment to be a bit more intelligent than average and who love their heroes to be flawed, real human beings who still choose to do the right thing even when they know it's not really good for their life or state of mental health.My only complaint with the show, and why I took one star off, is that I don't feel it realistically shows the truth about the mental health industry or the people who work in it as a whole. Although Dr. Pierce occasionally makes a snide remark about primitive drugs or people being committed and/or drugged the show tends to portray mental health workers, psychiatrists and hospitals as benevolent places and people who all really do care about those needing their services. That's a nice fantasy that I happen to know from bitter experience with family and friends just isn't true. In the real world those who are unlucky enough to find themselves labeled mentally ill are sadly all too often exploited and treated the worst by the very people who are supposed to be helping them. When Dr. Pierce's psychiatrist in the hospital tells him she can't treat him as a patient, but offers to be his friend as a replacement for an imaginary one I rolled my eyes and shook my head. That just never would happen except for maybe an equally outcast therapist or psychiatrist. And again, I know from real-world experience that they are often just as ostracized and badly treated by their colleages and generally they tend to gravitate towards private practices rather than large hospitals where they are often fired or laid off at the first chance their bosses get.Is the series worth watching? Just for Eric McCormack's performance and the originality of the series I would say yes. I'll see what Season 2 brings though before I decide that mabye I just can't keep suspending disbelief over the portrayal of a mental health industry as being far more benevelont and helpful than it really is. And that would be a shame, becaause everything else about this series hits a perfect note with me outside of that."
B008JAGM6Y Perception is probably the only show on this network that I watch regularly.  A character who personifies the word and it's fun to match wits with him and try to solve the mystery."
B008JAGM6Y It was silly Not a good story line. I could not get into the story. actors were not real enough to hold my interest."
B008JAGM6Y The Kilimanjaro episode is classic Pierce.  The premise for this episode was mostly new and well done. There were a few surprises, but they make sense when you look back and see how it all fit together.  I hope they do more episodes like this one. This would be an OK one to start with if you can't watch the episodes in order. I don't like to give spoilers, so just go watch it :P  Definitely worth a few bucks!"
B008JAGM6Y I really love seen the guy from Will and Grace in this show. He is very great actor, and I hope to see it make it this year. He makes you look at mental health in a different way all together. rebieanna"
B008JAGM6Y But six episodes do not make much of a season. Plus the cost of it was high. Will rent from now on."
B008JAGM6Y Nothing great. A good, solid tv show. Very similar to a couple already out there. Basic story-line... Weird, eccentric genius solves mysteries."
B008JAGM6Y For those of us who mostly see paranoid schizophrenia portrayed as the illness of psychopaths, it is really interesting to see it shown as one aspect of an otherwise extremely successful personality. The shifting boundaries between what is and isn't real can deceive the viewer as well as the main character (although not always), and the star's passion and talent are both on display."
B008JAGM6Y I discovered this DVD with having no knowledge of what it was about and that is IMHO the best way to experience it. I see there are already 89 reviews posted here ( many are based on the reviewer covering the TV show, not the DVD; check review date as Amazon groups ALL reviews of a show, whether streaming, DVD or broadcast TV), but I haven't read them yet. And if you don't like \"spoiler alerts\" you might want to skip the lengthier ones on first pass. You won't get any \"spoilers\" from  me here.The show's first season on ABC had 10 episodes. It's a murder mystery series (though it involves the FBI and not a local police bureau). The main character is a college professor in Chicago area who has had mental issues. But he has also written major books on psycho-pharmacology. He helps the FBI solve murders, one in each episode. But there is a back story line here too and I won't share that yet.Since the DVD has no commercials each episode runs less than 45 minutes (any you wonder how many commercials are inserted in the average TV show?) and so you can watch the whole season easily over 2-3 nights - as I did. I found that the best way as it flowed better. I'm not spoiling anything her by telling you a few things: The back story line has a nice \"arc\" and certain \"loose ends\" are tied up at the end. This is not one of those TV shows that leave you with a cliffhanger at the end of the season. The show has been renewed (I never saw it on TV and don't plan to watch Season Two until its DVD release) but this Season stands on its own. (Note that Episodes 9 and 10 are connected (a two-parter).Like an onion, each episode peels off another layer of the central character and things that had you wondering why things happened are revealed at appropriate times.Okay, so I didn't tell you much - but that is the idea. Try it and see if you aren't hooked. This most unique show captured me a- and I think will capture you!The DVD has no special features at all. Just the great 10 episodes.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B008JAGM6Y I watched this episode and slowly became aware of the hidden message. It became aware to me at the final scene, something that I had ancitipated was going on but I finally got confirmation. Something that I had been doing for awhile now.. I appreciate the sun glowing through the windows or the cool breeze blowing as I step outside. You know phrase \"Stop and smell the roses\"? Well i started doing that recently because wheather it be mental or physical, how long will I be here?I know this may sound a little corny, but I think that I should have started appreciating the \"finer things of life\" a long time ago. So, aside from all of the above mentioned comments, i like this show."
B008JAGM6Y I love this show.  It's quirky, but very well done.  I can't wait until Season II comes out.  I will buy that one also."
B008JAGM6Y Seriously if I want politics then I'll watch the news. This thing has way too much political undertones that are not even subtle to be likable. I'm used to some politics but this series reminds me of Cars 2 with its ham-fisted approach to political issues."
B008JSNIQS Is your secret boyfriend, your lost-in-the-jungle uncle, the favorite best friend you never had but always wished for. It's hard to disbelieve some of their findings, and whether or not they're chasing myth or reality, it's going to be a good show."
B008JSNIQS I've only seen one episode of \"Destination Truth\", the one ominously called \"Alien Invaders/Swedish Lake Monster\". I admit I laughed quite a lot, sometimes with Josh and his team, sometimes at them (or rather at the concept). But sure, this should get higher ratings than the incredibly boring \"Monsterquest\" over at History Channel.After a positively bizarre visit to the ex-Soviet republic of Kazakhstan (complete with Cold War kitsch and sputniks falling from the sky), Josh Gates and his indefatigable investigators make a landfall in Sweden - of all places. Somehow, paranormal phenomena isn't something you would normally associate with the land of The Welfare State and the Polkagris!But yes, folks, Sweden has its very own version of the Loch Ness monster, called Storsj&ouml;odjuret (try pronounce that). It supposedly lives, breathes or perhaps snorkels in the cold waters of Storsj&ouml;n, a lake outside the Swedish town of &Ouml;stersund in the county of J&auml;mtland.For decades, the monster was protected by law, but in 2005 the local authorities were forced to rescind the protection, since higher authorities found it to be \"frivolous\" - after all, there *is* no Great Lake Monster, and you can't legally protect a species that doesn't exist. Ah, the Swedish red tape, don't you just love it! According to urban legend, the decision to protect the monster was taken by the county office at April Fool's Day, but I haven't been able to confirm this.Frankly, I didn't know people in J&auml;mtland took their little monstrosity so damn seriously. Josh isn't kidding - there are cameras rigged all around the lake, to catch the monster on tape if it ever shows up above the waterline, a project financed by both the Swedish government (or rather by an obscure outfit of the vast Swedish government bureaucracy) and the European Union. So *that's* alright, but legal protection's a no-no?!I think Storsie, as English-speaking forteans call the monster, and \"Destination Truth\" go together very well, LOL. This show could be described as MacGyver meeting the Blair Witch, complete with team members screaming \"OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT?\" and constant cliff hangers (and commercial breaks) keeping the viewers on the edge...well, sort of. Josh & The Team certainly made an impression - they are still mentioned at the official website of Storsj&ouml;odjuret, where Josh is affectionately referred to as \"The Boss\".OK, let me guess, this show is...well, scripted?!That being said, I still feel a bit too old for this concept, but I'm sure the little people around 12 years of age will love every minute of it. As a crazy local patriot, I naturally have to give the episode five stars. But, as all monster shows, even \"Destination Truth\" ends inconclusively. After all, the Great Lake Monster might simply be...a pike.They are not protected by law."
B008JSNIQS Even though all they do on this show is chase mythical creatures around the world I still can't get enough of it. Josh Gates and Erin Ryder are hilarious together and when situations get intense I just can't pull myself away from the TV."
B008JSNIQS Face it, 99% of all the ghosts/myths this group investigates are non-existent but it doesn't matter because, unlike Ghost Hunters, this show is really a travelog disguised as investigative documentary. I watch it to see what insane things Josh will do in the name of &#34;the truth&#34; and this season is the best in that. Remote locations, interesting histories, hidden tribes, with a dash of Survival thrown in."
B008JSNIQS I enjoy these types of programs.Josh Gates it a fearless host and the show is produced well.Worth the price."
B008JSNIQS Seems a bit staged at times, but still a great adventure, better then the Hollywood studios can take you on."
B008JSNIQS Never a dull moment with Josh and his gang. Josh is hilarious and it has rubbed off onto the rest of the crew. The unique thing about Destination Truth are their travels, places I haven't even heard of. They go with what they find, no more no less."
B008JSNIQS I love the personalities, the travels, the experiences, the ideas behind the show....HOWEVER, I just can't stand the production...especially when the EXTRA UNKNOWN CAMERAMEN take shots ahead of the investigation crew.They climb down a cliff, but SOMEHOW the UNKNOWN CAMERAMAN was let down first, you know to get that shot of our heroes climbing down the cliff.  OR the classic river rafting, the UNKNOWN CAMERAMAN is along the shores taping the whole crew in a dangerous rapids.It's ruins the suspension of disbelief."
B008JSNIQS I love this show, and hope to see more seasons! I look forward to watching each episode and i watch them over and over again, i love Josh gates!"
B008JSNIQS This show is funny, informative, action pact, and sometimes makes you think.  I love the comedy woven into the hunt to unexplained things.  Well done!"
B008JSNIQS I am a Destination Truth Junkie! I love the show and waited anxiously for the season to start. But it seems to me that it ended just as quickly as it began. There are only 7 episodes to this season?? Totally not enough! I am sure it takes much longer to make an episode than any of us could possibly imagine, but there must be more?"
B008JSO21S I've been a fan since the beginning, when the cast was slim, yet with enough of the critical elements - a hot chick, a funny guy, the old cratchety guy and enough of an ensemble to carry a great sci-fi premise. As with so many shows that succeed, they add added a really great layer of characters in this latest season. So much so, that it is a darn shame the whole thing is slated to end in a shortened final season. I contend that the unending potential of the premise is enough to go several additional seasons, and perhaps seed a new cast or spinoff. Too darn bad. Why take chances on completely new and crappy shows when this one rocks?"
B008JSO21S It was a great season to watch, I just wish the last one on season 4 didn't end like it did.  You would have to watch it again before u jump to season 5 so you would understand what is happening."
B008JSO21S Enjoyable story line, nice grapics, casting does a great job.  I enjoyed watching this series and would enjoy watching the next season"
B008JSO21S OK, so ultimately the show made no sense, WHO CARES?  While I was watching it, I never for a minute doubted the existence of Artifacts and the Warehouse.  Season 4 is a great roller coaster ride, and while there are many serious themes and moments, mostly the series' light-heartedness and the cast's  sense of fun make this a great series to binge watch."
B008JSO21S Usually when season 3 and 4 roll around things start to feel stale.  But the writers of Warehouse 13 just keep the twists coming and make the story line interesting and moving forward.  Claudia stole a lot of this season.  I am looking forward to the final 6 episodes to see how the writers tie it all up."
B008JSO21S So far, Season 4 has been a disappointment.  Claudia and Jenks don't make sense if he is gay.  The dialog has gotten silly.  Have the writers changed or just gotten lazy?"
B008JSO21S I haven't been hooked on a Sci-Fi show since the Star Trek DS9 and VOY went off the air but I love this series! It was great seeing Jeri Ryan and Kate Mulgrew in past seasons(looks like from previews Kate Mulgrew is coming back this season too!).. and loved seeing Brent Spiner in the season premiere! Hope this show doesn't get canceled!"
B008JSO21S It's funny. Other than that I always wonder why I watch it, but I do. It strangely interesting. I like the characters and it gets serious when it should."
B008JSO21S Ever since last season when Artie used the astrolabe to keep the warehouse from being destroyed he has been plagued by the consequences in the form of an unspecfied \"evil\" being released and in Brother Adrian, the monk who swears that he will make certain that Artie pays the consequences for his actions.In this episode, the penultimate episode before the mid-season finale, Adrian attacks the warehouse by attacking the people that Artie loves, the warehouse denizens, by attacking the people they love. Thus, Myks goes off to save her sister, Claudia her brother and Pete his ex-wife. The artifacts used against family members are clever and difficult to spot and defuse and that alone would make this a good episode, but the real action takes place at the warehouse where Brother Adrian is stalking Artie through the aisles and artifacts continue to disappear. Lena is with Artie and what happens when Brother Adrian is finally revealed makes for heartbreaking television.Warehouse 13 has come into its own the last two seasons. It has always been a lot of fun with its steampunk elements and its magical warehouse but the show has really raised the stakes in the last two seasons in terms of both plot and character. Must see steampunk science fiction."
B008JSO21S Glad it has lasted this long! Easy family viewing for the younger guys. Not for little ones but your older elementary and middle schoolers. In the vein if &#34;The Librarian&#34;. We have really enjoyed it."
B008JSO21S After 4 years, still love this series! Can't wait for the next season. The network also is also giving Claudia's character a more active role in the Warehouse the past 2 years, which I really liked. Would love to see more of H.G. Wells, too!"
B008JSO21S The wittiness and humor continues into Season 4.  As with the prior seasons, this one is just as enjoyable.  Glad the characters saved the Warehouse and rescued Arte from his demons."
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13 has been a favorite for four years. Next year it will be cancelled after an abbreviated season. At least they are giving us a wrap-up unlike Alphas, which just left us on a cliffhanger.The stories are imaginative, believable, with delightful well-acted characters, unique people, really appealing."
B008JSO21S This is a relatively good scifi series. Some times it is a little hard to follow and sometimes it seems to get into back stories that don't seem related. But it holds your attention."
B008JSO21S This is a great show!  Funny and cool and imaginative!!  It has great characters too!  I can't wait to see what happens next!!"
B008JSO21S After seeing the departure of Smallville and Eureka, this show was great, much like the Libraian and National treasure this show finds artifacts that have powers and the ability to change human behavior for good or bad, Arty is great and if you are Jewish you will like it, the boss of the show in some episodes makes reference to the Talmud, and Is Jewish, A great show with new adventures every week"
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13 is goofy but fun. Characters are weird but fit.  Actors are great in their parts. Something's changed this year with Myka appearance-wise.  Maybe hair is much darker or frizzier or both.  A good show if you like to suspend disbelief and talk back to your tv."
B008JSO21S This show has so many good points I think they could use some of them for history classes.  They keep coming up with items that are related to historical events that you don't want to miss a minute.  Even the occasional references leads your thinking to that occurrence and sometimes, whether that's their story or real."
B008JSO21S I enjoy it for the most part..there is some fun wit in the writing and the actors arejust fine..the stories can be fun.  It's just fine for what it is..light and fluffy but entertainingand that is exactly what I like at times..I like the new quirky actress..she has a fun characterand that adds a lot and I think with time it will be getting better and better..it's still new to meand I am starting at the beginning never before having watched it even tho it's been around..My Roku has given me that ability..and I love my Roku!!"
B008JSO21S I love this show. This episode had a pretty convoluted plot. Can't wait to see what happens to Artie and perhaps all the rest of them, next."
B008JSO21S Like the chartersStories are believable if you like scfiWish there were more seasons, just started to really get to know the whole plot"
B008JSO21S I like the concepts of the show, the actors and the mix of personalities of the characters. AS they move into the next seasons, it;s getting harder for the writers to keep raising the stakes, but so far, the ideas have been fresh with interesting plot twists and good season arcs. It's a nice break from reality."
B008JSO21S Split into two seasons, the first 10 episodes were fantastic viewing.  I genuinely thought the writing, acting and special effects in the first ten episodes were the best yet.  Everyone genuinely brought their A-game in the acting department and the stories are still unique, fun, funny and exciting to watch and  I'm very satisfied as a fan of Warehouse 13.  I can't wait for the second half of the season to air, the trailers look amazing."
B008JSO21S I enjoyed all the seasons and episodes. Yea, sure there are some better than others, but if you are willing to take the good with the bad I think you'll give it 3 stars also."
B008JSO21S Awesome show, one of the best shows the syfy channel has come up with. I hope the show gets renewed for many more seasons."
B008JSO21S I think this is a pretty interesting series and season 4 is a good one.  There are so many boring moments one just has to get past to be rewarded with the good ones."
B008JSO21S This is a funny, show with actors who really seem to like what they do. Let's face it, it's good material as well: magically-imbued artifacts that need to be contained before they do harm. Endless material. I'm not a big fan of Claudia's character though... the constant attitude and snarkiness makes me want to slap her. Nevertheless, great show!"
B008JSO21S A light-hearted show that works for the whole family. We enjoy the plot lines they think up, including the way they work in historical facts."
B008JSO21S When the season started I felt it was a bit slow; but it picked up and, ended on such a high. Glad that I purchased the season after all; and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a change from reality and mind numbing television."
B008JSO21S it;'s warehouse 13 season 4. Usual crew, usual hijinks (see what I did there?). If you liked the first 3 seasons you'll like this. I understand it's the pentultimate season so be prepared."
B008JSO21S We received one shock after another with this season.  This had great guest stars that were excellent in their roles.  It definitely left me anxiously awaiting for the next season.  The characters had their moment of fun, but there was definitely more action in this season."
B008JSO21S This isn't the smartest Sci Fi show ever made. The performances aren't the best acting to be found, the stories aren't the most intelligent or inspired...but I love this show. It's fun and easy to just watch with your brain turned off. All the critiques on specific actors and the writer's choices regarding them are 100% correct. But you can just watch this similar to reading a comic book, turn off your brain and have some fun."
B008JSO21S It isn't often that a UNIQUE program is developed that is truly interesting, AND with a cast of Characters that effectively complement the SyFy program.  davzway RARELY gives a 5-Star rating ....Every once in awhile an original shows/concepts comes along that could go on forever.  Stargate was one.... Star Wars another....  While warehouse 13 may not have George Lucas directing or his budget... the cool concept is there.  All BS aside W13 is just FUN to watch.  Hope there are another four seasons in the future.  And don't forget how...Sometimes the good ones get canned- Captain Malcolm and Firefly should still be flying each week; revived with Serendipity and died.  Shame."
B008JSO21S We love this series!  Quirky, funny, exciting - what more do you need?  Sorry to see that the next season will be the last!"
B008JSO21S A must see for fans of the weird.  The supernatural is explained in alternate ways.  Is the best show I have seen in months. If you are a fan of Indiana Jones movies, this is right up your alley."
B008JSO21S I love this whole series. Watched it through Ruko. Beautiful picture in hd on my TV screen. Amazon prime instant video is a wonderful option to paid TV."
B008JSO21S Great series! Entertaining, funny and kind of wacky - you should start at the beginning or else you'll be lost."
B008JSO21S We enjoyed this show because it is so different.  It offers drama, suspense, humor, and a pretty good cast.  I highly recommend it."
B008JSO21S This is TV at its best....This is what I like to see... Week in & out.If you want some good fun kick TV.. Warehouse 13 is it."
B008JSO21S I love this show. The chemistry between the characters is wonderful.  I would like to believe certain objects posses powers or properties. The story lines are terrific."
B008JSO21S This season is just as layered and impressive as the previous three seasons!  The characters are ALL well written, which is an impressive feat for any show to manage consistently.  The conflicts in this season are more about personal demons - I'm enthralled.  I look forward to finishing the season and seeing how this unlikely band of people, who are like a family, come together!"
B008JSO21S This season like all the rest is just great.  Only problem is that Amazon is late when it comes to making episodes available.  This is often true with SyFy shows, that we have to wait two or more days.  Fortunately, they can be found elsewhee."
B008JSO21S I love the sense of adventure with a hint of actual history wrapped into the stories... I realize it's merely made up stories, but I find myself getting vested in each character."
B008JSO21S I have always been a fan of the Warehouse 13 series. Good family fun. I am pleasantly surprised to see this season 4 offered as a Prime membership bonus and am catching up on the characters and plots that I would otherwise have missed.Thank You for all of your Prime movies."
B008JSO21S Silly science fiction fun. Like Eureka it is light and very hard to believe science fiction fun. Likable characters and villans. Recommend for any science fiction buff. Does have adult themes so not for kids."
B008JSO21S Each episode is an action packed fun-filled ride with an engaging cast of characters that are well developed and consistent in the acting delivery. Kudos to the acting cast and the writers / developers for keeping the magic alive episode by episode."
B008JSO21S not your run of the mill show but fun to watch. each week has something new and out of the ordinary"
B008JSO21S This fourth season of 13 does not disappoint. A sinister evil is unleashed on our Warehouse protectors and only a few members are aware of this dark danger. Again, great sets, great directing and producing, great acting and great fun...Well done!Richie"
B008JSO21S A very creative series with a good group of actors. It rests on the premise that there are LOTS of &#34;artifacts&#34; out there that need to be found, recovered and stored to help protect us all. How it's done has a lot of humor that you'll enjoy."
B008JSO21S Not as good as the previous. You can tell that the main cast is just not into the show as much and some of the shows plots are being recycled (which is obvious) with this genre. Seems they have changed writers or something because it has gotten HORRIBLE this season. Can tell show is coming to a close, which believe is this year 2014."
B008JSO21S Certainly leaves you wanting to see the next season.This series is not filthy or foul.  Makes it enjoyable.  It has humor and drama.Really enjoy it.And headspinning plots LOL."
B008JSO21S fun to watch...lots of odd adventures... the characters are funny and the plots are interesting...its a great show... watch it"
B008JSO21S Watch this with the wife and very much enjoyed it. I wish it would continue being a favorite of ours"
B008JSO21S The show is simply enjoyable to watch.  The writers have done a nice job of developing the characters each with distinctive traits that blend well together and the casting selections were well chosen. We like how it weaves the use of old-school technology and. references to historical figures with futuristic/fictional tech.  Kinda like running the starship enterprise from a cozy gadgety-filled man caveish basement. It's a bit like Dr. Who in how it incorporates real history into fantastical plots.  It's not the history channel but it's not intended to be.  It's an enjoyable show with a comidic touch combined with scify drama that family members of all ages in our house enjoy watching.  The characters care about each other - like family.  It's not as clever as the Matt Smith episodes of Dr. Who but it's still good stuff."
B008JSO21S Love the way they use historical things in this show and keep you guessing.  Can't wait for the next season.  Thanks Amazon for having this one PRIME."
B008JSO21S i liked the little bit of partly true and partly fictional story lines.  poetic license for sure but great fun"
B008JSO21S I love the relationships between the characters and the scify-ness of it all! I enjoy the creativeness and humor the writers include in the scripts. Well acted, sometimes even  campy - but thats part of the fun!!!"
B008JSO21S Quirky and fun show. The characters are wonderful and unique and they meld nicely. The historical references and the warehouse spin is nice."
B008JSO21S Suspenseful and amusing.  Sometimes amazing but always enjoyable.  I have advised my children to share this program with their teenagers for research into the different artifacts and personalities involved."
B008JSO21S I'm really bummed that this is the last season, luckily I have 4 seasons on DVD now so I can watch this as often as I want.  Just waiting for season 5 to be released."
B008JSO21S I'm not a big fan of sci fi television show of movies. my husband started watching this show on Netflix and I slowly got into it at first but the more I watched, the more I started to like it. I like the story lines, the action in each episode as well as the characters. My only downfall is that I wish there were more episodes in the season."
B008JSO21S If you liked seasons one, two or three, you will like this one.  Fun ,a little corny at times, sci-fi show.  Similar entertainment to eureka with a little more unexplained items."
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13 has from the beginning been a good series and this one is no exception another good season . such a shame it's coming to an end next summer"
B008JSO21S Love the characters and the interaction.  It have a good mixture of funny and touching moments.  It can go anywhere with all the artifacts that cause anything the mind can come up with.  Great show."
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13 always delivers in comedy, interests and information.  The actors are consistently funny and entertaining and for the most part, I find the story line interesting.  I have to admit, I have enjoyed this series."
B008JSO21S If you like the series this will float your boat. High adventure with a very good cast that I can identify with."
B008JSO21S Season 4 gets involved with the characters' interpersonal relationships more than previous seasons. We also see how using artifacts to do good also can result in very bad outcomes. More people associated with WH13 die, some return from the dead, and some do not. I haven't completed watching the season yet and hope some things get resolved in a better way than so far revealed. I look forward to watching more, but also realize that the more I see, the closer I get to the end."
B008JSO21S can never get enough of this show this was not my favorite the part about the musician and the healingwas interesting.There can be a wonderful exchange of energy between player and audience! When listeners andplayer connect it is truly Magic. I know I play and it happens all the time to me!Johnstars"
B008JSO21S We really like this show. it's funny with well developed quirky characters and the storylines stay fresh and unique from other shows. It's great to be able to watch one after another in a mini marathon so you don't have to wait to see what happens. One reason Amazon Prime is nice."
B008JSO21S It does not has the best special effects but is a good tv show to have a good relaxing time ."
B008JSO21S This series reminds me of the Friday the 13th TV show from the 80s, which was one of my all time favorites. I love the twists and turns involved in hunting down the artifacts and I can tell the actors are having a great time. This season has a new protagonist who turns out to be a complete surprise."
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13!  One of our favorites!  Waited for it to come out, was worth the wait, now waiting for season 5."
B008JSO21S This is a light entertaining & imaginative program.  The characters draw you in.  It is really too bad they didn't keep this going.  They had endless material & so many stories left to tell."
B008JSO21S It took me a few episodes to get into this but now that we are in season for I'm a huge  fan! Love all the characters even Mrs. Fredricks who's a big creepy :)"
B008JSO21S I loved this series, unfortunately it's being canceled.  I found the episodes to be very original and well acted with a lot of action.  It's episodes cover the &#34;weird&#34; form the paranormal to the scientific to the extraterrestrial."
B008JSO21S It is a science fiction which I love watching. The agents are looking for artifact items as when they find them, they are in the Warehouse."
B008JSO21S So I deeply enjoy Eureka, so finding out that these two stories were linked was a delight. I'm so upset that the final season in a brief 5th season (which I haven't seen yet), but I liked the story enough to buy the 4th season after finishing the first 3 on Netflix. Quirky, emotional, fun."
B008JSO21S This show has characters with good relationships with each other and are interesting. The different items with special powers is a interesting twist. It's hard to watch just one!"
B008JSO21S The writing of this series is excellent.  The story lines usually stand alone, however there have been some story themes that go throughout the series.  I found all of the episodes to be excellent entertainment.  I would like to have access to a season five."
B008JSO21S This science fiction/fantasy series can still hold interest even after 4 seasons.There's just the right amount of quirky possibility to the story to make it almost believable.Believable,if you aspire to government secrets and cover ups concerning science fiction matters,like hanger  51,etc.It's fun none the less."
B008JSO21S I love the family vibe and all the quirkiness of all the team ----the episodes are creative and mysterious without being cheezy --and even when they are cheezy, I'm IN!"
B008JSO21S I am a huge, huge fan of Warehouse 13. But the whole thing with McPhearson and how mean Arti was to H.G. Wells doesn't ring true. McPhearson killed people, hurt Mica's family, and yet Arti acts like McPhearson was so innocent? Bull. That whole thing in the previous seasons really burned me on Arti. The writers screwed up."
B008JSO21S I want to preface this by saying I am a HUGE WH13 fan. I love everything about it from the cheesy jokes to the awesome purple goo. This season is no exception. I was worried and nervous about what direction the show was going to take coming out of season 3. Although I personally would have gone a different direction, I was pleasantly surprised by what they did with the show this season. There was a lot of suspense and intrigue. It's sad that season 5 is the last season, but hopefully they will tie up all the loose ends nicely."
B008JSO21S Watched this, and liked it, but just not my style of show. The acting and story are great, and the ideas are excellent, but I'm not so much into series now. If I was, this would be one of my favorites."
B008JSO21S This was a very good season of this show. They did a good job of plot development and left me wanting to see the next season."
B008JSO21S This show is fantastic! Great sci-fi and mystery without being cheesy. And the humor is spot on. I definitely recommend this show."
B008JSO21S It just keeps getting better and better.  I have watched all the seasons and this has been the best yet."
B008JSO21S If you like the first three seasons you will like this one too.  The highjinks of the team continue as the now expanded group fight ancient enemies and uncover hidden truths about their relationships.  Its what you would expect from the Sy-Fy channel, they can't even spell Sci-Fi right so don't expect much from their shows."
B008JSO21S I really enjoyed this series very much and hope that the network will make more episodes .this was an awesome show."
B008JSO21S The only bad thing about this show is that I have to pay to watch it (no cable TV). The characters are great (though I'm not sure about the new B & B owner)."
B008JSO21S I love how this show incorporates different genres of information and sprinkles it over this delicious cake of entertainment! Pete is my fave character!!"
B008JSO21S This is a great show.  It is a little something different.  Funny and addictive.  You will fall in love with the characters."
B008JSO21S Very good family watching. I loved the special effects and visuals. Cool concept. It makes me wonder if something similar exists in real life."
B008JSO21S This series is very fun and intelligent. One of the best that SyFy has produced. Not much gore and lots of character and plot development. Love it!"
B008JSO21S Awesome show. Fun to watch. This is a great sci fi show with a good story line. If you have not watched do so this very evening."
B008JSO21S Good plots, great characters...too bad they killed off a major character. Still love it though. Can't wait for season five."
B008JSO21S The chartacters are unique and the show is different from other cops and doctors shows. The show is original background."
B008JSO21S This series always keeps me going. I really enjoy it and look forward to the upcoming season. Hope it comes soon."
B008JSO21S I actually watched the first 2 seasons on tv. I gave only 3 stars because the males seem to be depicted as having gotten mush in the brain since the first episode and act a little like weak women. While the women seem to have taken over and are front and center. Not as good a show to me now and that is why I stopped watching it on tv. I know the &#34;matriarchy is coming&#34; but come on Hollywood not yet :("
B008JSO21S I watch every show, enjoy them very much.  Fanciful tales and good characters with humor too.  What's not to love. Hope Amazon can pick up season 5 for Prime next year."
B008JSO21S I chose 5 stars because I love this show and will choose it over almost any other shows I have recorded. A new Bones might be the possible exception. I enjoy the historical references and the imagination of whoever comes up with the artifact ideas. I'm not a sitcom humor sort of person but these characters are funny in a believable way as you get to know their characters. There are twists that keep you from guessing the ending."
B008JSO21S The writers are the best!  They took a great story line and added great actors. What i really appreciate about this show is that the writers wrote great shows and didn't feel the need to include constant profanity and senseless violence.  I love it.  Its very sad that the show is in it last season.  I will miss it.  We need more writers and shows like this."
B008JSO21S Season 4 continues the saga that is warehouse 13. It's a fun show and if you've made it to season 4..nothing in this review will persuade you one way or the other."
B008JSO21S I wasn't sure I would... the first few episodes were a little hokey, but I came to like the characters and their human frailties. Mrs. Frederick is a cool character, and I'm glad the kept Aaron Ashmore on as Jenks. I've read that SyFy is only going to offer about 6 episodes for a Season 5 to wrap things up. I'm looking forward to that."
B008JSO21S Rarely does this series disappoint. Great adventure and mystery peopled by a wonderful ensemble cast. You get swept up in the fun the cast seems to be having. The added bonus of no commercials makes it all a breathless fun house ride. Tall tales meet a police procedural -- great fun and a great escape!"
B008JSO21S I really enjoy this show most of the time but this season is not fun. It is very dark and serious. It also has what I call a comic book death. There is too much menace and killing to really enjoy the show. The light fun is gone. Even when it is fun there is not enough to allieviate the dark and menacing element now present.The show is worth watching don't get me wrong it is just not the light entertainment I am use to. This season and last season they seem to be heading for the dark brooding show such as Angel or Forever Knight."
B008JSO21S Season four seems to be vearing off to 'way out there' plots. But we still enjoy the cast of characters.  Show is original and entertaining.  As in previous seasons this show centers around a team who tracks down artifacts (items) that have been owned by someone famous (most of the time), which retain some form of special ability.  Once the item is located the go through a process where they obtain the item and bring it back to 'Warhouse 13' where it is stored away from the public.  This, in most cases, is the best thing to keep the public safe.  If you have not tried this show you have three previous seasons to catch up on.  I'm sure you will get hooked, as we did.  Recommended."
B008JSO21S The gang is still here (sort of) and the cases are stranger; danger is heightened, but there is nothing that cannot be overcome with LOVE. But, oh the consequences!!!"
B008JSO21S This place is a top-secret warehouse where all of the bizarre & strangest artifacts & relics the U.S. gov&#34;t. has stored. Two agents are charged with tracking down new objects and retrieve missing ones, so they take dangerous treks around the world to finally piece together the clues to where they are. Although this season proved to be the most dangerous with a twist here and a turn there. This season continued where they left off in Season 3. The gang had to endure an Atomic explosion of the Warehouse and how their boss found a way to reverse time with one the most strangest objects to prevent it from happening. He did prevent it from happening, but there&#34;s always a price to pay for &#34;tinkering&#34; with these objects and time itself. I tell ya SYFY Network always seems to come with the most imaginative Science Fiction I&#34;ve ever seen and I&#34;m glad. I like these kinds of TV shows and could watch them again and again. So, if you don&#34;t mind, I going watch it right now!"
B008JSO21S The writing is getting better, and there's a bit more inter/intra-character development (i.e. soap opera feel). The acting is still a bit comical, but the pacing and production are quite good. I really like the 'MST3K' styled interstitials between scenes and destination overlays (with crazy animation and funky fonts) that they use in the series. The effects and props are awesome. I love the in-show references to old-style cultural influences (like Star-Trek, Star Wars, Battle Star Galactica and others) and some of the recurring cast members (Brent Spiner, Lindsay Wagner, Kate Mulgrew and others). If they stick to the historical exploration model - Through discovery and disposition of misbehaving artifacts and associated characters - I'll continue to be a fan. If they stray too far down the inter/intra-personal character development path they risk the trap of becoming another 'sy-fy soap opera'. When that happens I'll bail on the show. So stick to your roots Warehouse 13. Don't sink into the writer's trap of character development."
B008JSO21S This season is very intense. It is more serious and on the edge of your seat stuff going on. Still has a lot of fun in it and action but a bit more serious. I only give it a 4 because of the gay theme they have put in the show."
B008JSO21S As with all the other seasons they left you hanging as to will there be another wonderful story.  Each episode was as good as the last one.  I hope they will continue with is great series.."
B008JSO21S Warehouse 13 Season 4 was just as pleasurable as the previous seasons of this hit television show.  The show is entertaining and a pleasure to watch.  If a fan of the show I don't think you will be put off.  Definitely a watch worthy show."
B008JSO21S The show starts weaker than what it is afterward. Need to be watched season after season to like it better. The reason could be for: more depth regarding main characters, better visual effects, introducing more characters played by respected and loved celebrities, and for sure revealing information regarding core elements in the tv show.By completing the 4th season I can say the 3rd and 4th is better than 1st and 2nd for some of above mentioned reasons.I found little annoying things in this show but what show that doesn't have any annoying thing..so I decided not to mention them as 
B008JSO21S Love this show! Myka and Pete are great together and everyone loves Claudia and Artie!"
B008JSO21S While the writers often have the characters digress into some of the worst dialogue/action exchanges ever put to paper and then shot for the screen, the show's quirky cast, fantastic story concepts and apocalyptic season-to-season cliffhangers keep me coming back for more.  This show is thoroughly entertaining and has helped bridge the gap since losing Eureka from the airwaves."
B008JSO21S Still coming out with good stories.  Like the concept of the show secret government wharehouse of artifacts hidden away to protect the public; although adding an underlying message that takes away rather than add to the stories..."
B008JSO21S The first half of this season had a great story line and continued of the previous season. The second half of this season went in another direction but the team as always handles everything in stride. This show is truly an original and is one of my favorites, Okay I'm a TV junkie and watch and collect a lot of shows but this is a great Sci-Fi show that's original and unique and lastly refreshing."
B008JSO21S This is a fun show, with a great combination of action, adventure, humor, supernatural possibilities and situations, good vs. evil.  It's good clean fun and witty entertainment."
B008JSO21S warehouse 13 is a must see. it's truly an adventure with a thrill a minute. it ended but I want to see more. are you going to make more?"
B008JSO21S Very interesting story lines and like able characters. Keeps me coming back for more. A little over the top at times but still good fun."
B008JSO21S It's different than most other TV shows that I watch and I like that. It also makes you wonder if there are real &#34;artifacts&#34; out there!"
B008JSO21S A lot of this series bends the imagination to a very stimulating brain tease.  I love watching this and will probably go back for seconds."
B008JSO21S Adventures into the unknown every week for you to enjoy! Find out what powers hidden artifacts possess, and whether Artie survives  his delima."
B008JSO21S Will miss it"
B008JSO21S I really like this show but if nothing happens soon I am out.  They keep saying July but no specific date. Really? Viewers will not play this game. They do not have that kind of hold on me. I can let this show go. So, what's it going to be?"
B008JSO21S Everyone was at their best - or worst depending on how you look at them.  It just wish it hadn't been the setting stage for the end of the series.  True entertainment is rare these days and a story you can lose yourself in for a while is even more rare.  The Warehouse really is a living entity of endless wonder - and I will miss my favorite characters so much.  My streaming and DVDs are going to get a MAJOR workout frequently in the future."
B008JSO21S Being a huge fan of Eureka I was disappointed when they stopped it but Warehouse 13 is just amazingly funny and keeps me looking forward to yet another season!"
B008JSO21S Okay, so I got drawn into Warehouse 13 by the props and stage settings.  I'm a steam punk fan and Warehouse 13 seems to answer my need for seeing 19th Century and early 20th Century weapons and inventions still being used in the 2000's."
B008JSO21S The word that keeps coming up as I watch this season--and even season 3--is &#34;clever&#34;.  Time and time again, the characters will come up with a cute or clever line just to be cute or clever."
B008JSO21S A cross between Raiders of the Lost Arc and CSI.  It's fun to watch, but sometimes you don't have a reference for their conclusions."
B008JSO21S Episodes have good story lines and fun humor.  The actors are compatible and produce a much appreciated escape to another experience to just sit back and enjoy.  I trust that they are not going to fill my head with a negative bizarre experience of murder and mayhem.  (:"
B008JSO21S Look scifi has always been a little corny at times but that is what makes it good. Warehouse has made it great by the Characters inner mingling with each other in a great continuing story. The effects are top shelf and the writing is solid I like it and will continue to be a fan and watch as long I can find an episode to view."
B008JSO21S It has been some time since I saw the first three seasons, and in the interval I had forgotten how cartoonish and over acted it is. Still OK if you are in the mood for camp, but not a must see."
B008JSO21S The Warehouse 13 show is funny, smart, full of suspense.  The characters are well developed and full of surprises. It is a entertaining show well worth the town."
B008JSO21S I love all the things about this show, including the abundance of corn and the way they tend to hop right over some plot holes. The characters are what matter most, and this season really put the characters through some turmoil. I'm holding my breath for them until next season."
B008JSO21S Season 4 was definitely a downgrade from previous seasons and if you juxtapose it to Season 1, the differences are stark.  The acting is fine: I have no qualms with the cast.  They have done the best with what they were given.  The problem is, they were not given very much to work with.  The writing this season was pretty bad.In most series, as time goes on the characterization goes from shallow to deep; from stereotype to individual.  Not in season 4.  Pete reverts to a caricature of himself, Artie loses it, there is NO WAY Claudia would ever get named Caretaker - she is too reckless and stupid.  The list goes on.  Plot holes, fall backs on deus ex machina, actions and reactions inconsistent with the rest of the seasons..... Too bad.  I truly liked the series.Lesson to SyFy:  When you find good writers, PAY THEM!"
B008JSO21S Love this show, great characters and really interesting premise! Wish it would have went on even longer than it did! They could use so many other items in history as artifacts! Love it!"
B008JSO21S I love warehouse 13 great series. something to catch your attention, with great characters one of the more fun shows from syfy"
B008JSO21S I just love the concept of this show about a secret government warehouse, where all these secret artifacts are stored that can change the world. I especially enjoy the characters and the actors who portray them. I encourage  anyone to spend time with these folks, and  you'll become hooked on the show, wishing there were more episodes than presently available."
B008JSO21S I began watching Warehouse 13 when it first became available on Netflix.  I really enjoy this series and I appreciate Amazon making it available on Amazon Prime.  Thank You."
B008JSO21S The writers and producers took the series into a direction that is away from the formula which worked well - now it is formulaic and not worth watching."
B008JSO21S what can I say about this it has action, drama, intense moments, humor, and you can expect the unexpected. the only down side is when Myka and Pete bicker back and forth it's annoying but the rest of it is worth the watch."
B008JSO21S This show is very intertaining in that it has suspense, mystery, and adventure as well as humor and at times saddness.  I have enjoyed these episodes and am looking forward to the next.  I would recommend this program."
B008JSO21S While the first two seasons were very good, and season three was okay, this season seems to have lost that indefinable something that made the show enjoyable. It is hard to explain, but something in the chemistry of the show was lost in season four. Some of the characters seem to have lost their depth, and the artifacts, which were key parts of stories past, seem to have become mere props. I'll pass on season 5. Have lost interest."
B008JSO21S I just enjoy Warehouse 13 streaming via Amazon Prime. No matter the plot: They can be silly, they can be dramatic.The main thing is, Warehouse 13 is a show worth watching, one of very few we care for."
B008JSO786 I enjoyed season 2 of Alphas! The story line kept me interested.  I hope the ending was not the final episode!  I would like to see a season 3."
B008JSO786 I got hooked on Alphas starting with Season 2 and going back to watch Season 1. The end of Season 2 is a shocker which seems to end the show altogether which was utterly disappointing. There were some things that reminded me of Heroes but Alphas does it better!"
B008JSO786 Awesome! Very upset that they would cancel this show after only 2 seasons? Why won't another network pick it up? Ridiculous."
B008JSO786 Alphas has an interesting premise:  quirky individuals with extra-special abilities.  I enjoy it, for the most part.  For me, the major drawback to the show is that the idiosyncrasies of the individuals are often extreme, making them less likable."
B008JSO786 I found this series very entertaining.  It kept my attention due to the investigation of super natural events.  This program is a syfy plus."
B008JSO786 Alphas is an original, fascinating show. It delivers strong characters, great stories, and suspense.Hopefully, SYFY will see fit to renew this outstanding show for a third season. Season two was a cliffhanger."
B008JSO786 This is a really great show.  I wish it would it would not have been cancelled and would come back on."
B008JSO786 It has been a good series. It holds your interest and always makes you want to come back and view the next episode."
B008JSO786 This is much like a super hero show yet the people live in a real world, the actors are great, and it is a show where you cant wait till you see the next episode"
B008JSO786 Another very good Alpha.  Sometimes I think the plot moves along too fast.  But our favorites are there.  The story makes you want to watch more."
B008JSO786 I watch this series for its action and fantasy/scifi aspects.  This episode is loaded down with interpersonal drama, hand-wringing and an especially touchy-feely sex scene. In fact, there's a lot of touchy-feely, chick flick stuff in it. If that's your cup of tea, fine.  And some such is more or less expected in this day and age.  However, this episode is way too full of it. Given my personal preferences, if it were not for a very intriguing alpha related plot element, I would have given this episode 2 stars and I would be feeling a lot of concern about the future direction of the show."
B008JSO786 Don't get me started on how frustrating it is to see a fun, exciting, interesting, compelling show get cancelled! Argh! Please watch both seasons, they are worth it. Just be prepared to be angry at the end of Season 2... which has a GREAT cliffhanger! I really hope that they decide to follow up with a 2-hour finale or something... let's face it, only more episodes would suffice. Great show!"
B008JSO786 The whole concept is fascinating.  I believe some of the abilities of the Alphas cross over into spiritualism rather than super-natural ability, especially when the individual loses control of his abilities.  I felt that the second season became rather dark and bled into the occult.  For example, why did Dr. Rosen's dead daughter appear?The success of the Stargate series and the Eureka series is that the audience knew that they were always going to be in a comfort zone of discipline, properly applied principles, personal strengths and a team working with good leadership.  The Alphas team is breaking out of standards of appropriate behavior in some cases.  Human frailty is certainly normal and acceptable, but it seems to be becoming the theme rather than the exception.  Escapism entertainment should always leave the audience feeling better about themselves for having shared the experience with the characters.  I hope the Alphas can get back to that formula.  The audience cares about these people.  Give them a great reputation to live up to."
B008JSO786 *some nonspecific spoilers*Normally cliffhanger endings piss me off but in this case I will make an exception. Loved it! Love the character developement on this show. Love that they brought back Summer Glau. Love that they have Sean Astin. Love that the girls get to be the ones who save the world with their minds instead of the boys with their guns. Love all the new questions that this episode brought up. I can't wait for the new season!"
B008JSO786 Alphas is very good and it is not like the other stories like X Men and Mutant X. This series have a better story line and I like all the characters with their special abilities.  I think Alphas is a better word than mutants.  I hope it will make it to the next season."
B008JSO786 Had never seen this show before and found it to be very entertaining. Wish the show would have lasted longer"
B008JSO786 This is a pretty good classic sci-fi series, makes for pretty good watching but dont' expect to be floored its good not great."
B008JSO786 I love this show.  I really wish it had not been canceled.  I watched the first season on Netflix and the only place I could find the 2nd season was on Amazon.  Excellent HD quality!"
B008JSO786 It is bad enough that for a Monday night show, you have to wait until Wednesday night to get this, but then only 2 minutes!  Where is the rest?"
B008JSO786 A LITTLE LET DOWN WHEN THEY PUT IN THE SEX PARTS. OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS AWESOME. THOUGHT OUT PLOT, STORY DID NOT GO BORING OR LAME. THEY WERE FUN TO WATCH AND HAD ALL THE &#34;NO WAY&#34; PARTS. HAD THE SAD, FUNNY INTENCE PARTS, WITH AN ENDING TO KEEP YA HOOKED."
B008JSO786 I was thrilled to see Season 2 is now available on Amazon Prime Videos!  This is an intelligently written show with great special effects and interesting characters who happen to have amazing abilities. Much better than 90 percent of the crap that's on prime time TV.  I wish Amazon or even NetFlix would see the value in producing this series themselves. Thoroughly entertaining!"
B008JSO786 Finally a TV series that has good chemistry between it's characters. I truly enjoy watching this because the characters care for one another and even though they each have their own demons figure a way to get past them and help the people in need."
B008JSO786 Would love to see them develop the relationships with the team better. I mean if they are partners why are they arguing all the time?and wouldn't it be awesome if Rosen was a secret Alpha?"
B008JSO786 Anybody who has seen \"Heroes\" will immediately know the basic outlines of this show. It's about a group of humans with superpowers who fight criminals, but with an attempt to make the superheroes more realistic rather than like comic book characters.The show is entertaining. It never really rises to greatness though. Three things held it back. First, it seems too familiar, almost like a \"Heroes Lite.\" There's nothing that really makes the show stick out, except perhaps David Strathairn, who defies the stereotypes as an elderly, kindly leader who lacks superpowers. The villain in this season, Stanton Parrish, is also a highlight. He comes across a much more nuanced character than most TV villains. He's clearly human, even while he's a terrorist.Second, the show never seemed like it was going anywhere. Like a modern serials, which seem obsessed with continuity, the show keeps dropping hints about a bigger mystery but seldom provides resolution. Some villains disappear from the picture without use even knowing who they were or why they were such a threat. We do get some character development, especially with the female characters, but the male characters seem stuck in place. Some characters seem to just pop up once or twice but don't seem to really drive anything further.Finally, the ensemble doesn't fully work. There are a lot of things I like about the characters. They seem much more real and grounded than most TV sci-fi characters. Also, I'm glad they didn't choose a bunch of supermodels for all of the roles (the actors are attractive but not supermodels). Individually, the characters work pretty well.Unfortunately, collectively it seems like there are cliques, as if they don't all work as a team. The show seemed to have trouble finding good situations for the male and female characters to work together. Some pairings worked (like Bill and Gary), but rather than following a team I almost felt like I was watching several small groups with a loose connection to each other.Overall, I'd recommend the show for fans of dramatic sci-fi (or if you loved \"Heroes\"), but go in with realistic expectations."
B008JSO786 Why, Why, Why was this show not renewed? The story line was interesting in the first season and just got better in the second."
B008JSO786 I became a regular watcher of these and was sorry when the series was not renewed. Some of the best never get renewed, maybe because they cost too much $$$ to produce? After all, networks can made a ton of money turning out mindless babble the masses will watch, instead, made much more cheaply. These were actually thoughtfully written and produced."
B008JSO786 What a great show this is. A great cast and a great premiss and it gets ruined because some network JERK doesnt care if he leaves people hanging at the end of a season .... no resolution in site. It makes watching the show a complete waste of time since it leaves you in limbo with no questions answered, and believe me, there are many , many questions left unanswered...the entire show becomes an enigma... this would be a 5 star show if it had anything close to an ending ...Boooooooooo!!!! Hissssssssssss!!!!"
B008JSO786 Wonderful series. Tragic it was cancelled after 2nd season.  I always enjoyed how the team came to care for and respect each other despite their vastly different personalities.  David Strathairn should've gotten an Emmy for his acting."
B008JSO786 After the first episode, I was hooked. The cast is engaging, and quirky enough to make the whole series interesting,.  The characters are essentially superheros who are fighting against their all too human flaws. I was sorry when I ran out of episodes to watch. If i had to single out one which is very, very interesting, it' Gary the autistic one.  Remarkable.  Of course, the scenarios strain believeability, but it is science fiction after all.  I recommend it."
B008JSO786 I am not quite to the end of season 2 yet but it is intriguing enough to make me want to see season 3, if there is one.."
B008JSO786 Enjoyed this show! It was intense with good action. This episode left me with anticipation for the next week episode."
B008JSO786 I had high hopes for this but it just seems to average and plain in it delivery and viewing experience to make you care if you come back week after week."
B008JSO786 Season one okay, season two much better due to better actor development and interaction.  The show is very well written."
B008JSO786 I'm not happy with the series ending. The last episode leaves with a cliffhanger that of course will never be resolved.If you're considering the series, start with season 1 and watch it in order. It won't make much sense otherwise."
B008JSO786 Leaves alot of speculation or anticipation for the next season.  Who is the traitor?  Who is for and against for both sides?  Is it the same fight, just different methods?"
B008JSO786 Having seen a couple of episodes when it was on SCIFI (maybe it still is - I dropped cable) my wife and I was looking for another great TV episode and found it with the ALPHAS.  We have enjoyed and looked forward to each and every episode.  Great, clean TV with pizazz."
B008JSO786 This show gets better and better. I was a bit disappointed on one of the episodes &#34;evil twin&#34;, really guys!!! Overall though, the show is fantastic. Keep them coming!"
B008JSO786 I love this show please keep it coming I am missing it the actors are awesome can't wait to see what season three with bring which I hope will be soon."
B008JSO786 This season was definitely one of the highlights of the fall television season. Hopefully more people will give this show a try and show Syfy that this show is worth keeping around a few more seasons. Syfy should consider having an actor from Warehouse 13 or there new show Defiance guest star on Alphas in order to attract some new viewers."
B008JSO786 Most of the show I watch are sci-fi.  I enjoy them the most, get to detach from reality and daydream."
B008JSO786 Well thought out and very engaging. I haven't cared about a group of characters so much since Firefly. Production value is good, acting, action, drama, and humor are woven seamlessly to create the best scifi show going. If the writing stays as strong as season 2, it will be one of the best ever."
B008JSO786 Alphas is a great show for the Syfy network and they gave up on it!  I am getting so tired of investing my time into science fiction shows that are actually good, getting the shaft!  Gary was becoming my best bud:(.  I also really hate that they left a HUGE cliffhanger at the end of season 2.  They should at least do the fans a favor and give us a 2 hour series ending.  But  whatever:/!"
B008JSO786 A continuation of Alpha 1. I like the new characters that are added..it continues to keep my interest as the team works together to try and capture the bad Alpha leader who is unable to be killed."
B008JSO786 2 seasons was enough, but the ending left you using your own imagination. It is definitely how ones would act if this was a possible happening, but it is not."
B008JSO786 This was a good episode.  It was nice to see a familiar face as a guest star.  However,  I always wish Malik Yoba would have more of a presence or positive impact in the episodes."
B008JSO786 I really enjoy this show. I like the characters, the strange and wacky plots, and I particularly like the character of Gary. It is well done."
B008JSO786 I enjoyed the characters and their back stories. The shows are quick passed and have action but are not dominated by fights and car chases. Time is given to develop the characters, tell their stories and deal with issues of &#34;Good&#34; and &#34;Bad, &#34;Right&#34; and &#34;Wrong&#34;.I hope they do a Third Season."
B008JSO786 Enjoyable for its genre. Interesting characters. Okay build to the season and series finale as the show has been cancelled."
B008JSO786 Back in 2001 there was a hit show called mutant x. It was made by the same company who made the tv show 'Andromeda\".  Both show were doing quite well and then the company that made them went under. And the two hit shows went down with it. 'Mutant x\" lasted 3 years and was going to come back for a fourth series.  ten years later the Scy Fy channel decided to create it's own show with mutants. They called them 'alphas' but like the other show the mutants looked human and had powers. Sadly scy fy cancelled this one as they do most of their tv series of late. They instead spend most of their money on cheap Saturday movies that don't have half the value of what they did with their tv shows. This interesting show seemed like it had a chance , but since it was on scy fy it in reality was doomed. (spoiler alert) And the show now has one of the grimmest endings of a American show ever! (although this was made in Canada). They must have planned for a happier ending when the third series premiered , instead we got the true end of the whole thing. this series didn't even get a dvd release so you will have to watch it on instant video to see the final series. Still the series does have a ending. And that ending is now the final destination of most of the characters if you get my drift. The hd picture looks great too."
B008JSO786 To my fellow nerds who enjoy comic books super heroes and cool powers. Alphas keeps the hits rolling. Yes I know its very similar to the x-men but if you ever watched the south park episode where butters almost has a nervous break down because the Simpsons have already done every thing, then u know its all been done to one extent or another, but that does not take away from the fact that it is still a good story. And these mutants are not as tough as the ones we are used to plus all there powers come with a draw back. So far season two has a good story ark combined with some very good acting. I like it maybe you will to."
B008JSO786 The alphas is ok about super power human beings it has a good storyline  if nothing else is on tv to watch this will fill in"
B008JSO786 I watch lots of series, but this one just lets you imagine what it would be like to have special powers and what you would do with them if you had them.  It's kind of a knock off of other shows but still interesting and fun to watch."
B008JSO786 After being blown away by the first few episodes in the 1st season, the show degrades into a soap opera between the characters, becoming obnoxious after a while -- a lot of negative sniping at each other.&#34;Gary&#34; the autistic savant is brilliant and the only character that makes the show worth watching at all.The plot ideas are pretty good but the writing or directing (can't tell which) drops the ball over and over again on what could have been a thrilling show and turns it into an emotion fest for the actors Too much emphasis on the characters' emotional conditions/relationships taking away from the exploitation of their fantastic abilities. It may be just the directing trying and failing to make something intense from weak writing. A characters' emotional break down is rarely as interesting as seeing them use their amazing talents.If you love watching characters with incredible abilities emote rather than seeing a story with them using their talents in unique situations, then you'll love this show."
B008JSO786 I never watched until I started streaming it...this is a great series and I am hooked I wonder if it is still in procduction."
B008JSO786 One of the best story lines on TV! Great special effects, fairly good acting, i can't wait until next season..."
B008JSO786 Alphas, as always, was amazing. I loved Season 2 even more!! Twists and turns and excellent screen writing abound!! A must see for any Alphas lover!!"
B008JSO786 Cut along with several other Syfy channel series (Eureka and Warehouse 13 also got the axe) when Comcast (the cable company) acquired the Syfy net as part of its purchase of NBC/Universal, this was a show worth watching. It had elements of Fringe (which did run its course) in the Alpha capability and had promise for an excelle
B008JSO786 Dr. Rosen is free and the Team is back together...sort of.Gary's attitude has drastically changed since being locked up in Bignhamton, Nina is abusing her ability to Push people for personal gain and Hicks is having an Affair with Rosen's Daughter (whose in league with Red Flag Leader Stanton Parish).When a Doctor is Kidnapped by a man moving faster than Normal the team is called in to investigate. They learn that the suspect was experimented on by the victim and the result is accelerated aging. Rosen and his team set a trap for the suspect but he instead goes after Rosen looking for help.Can Rosen help the Alpha before he dies of Old Age at 22?"
B008JSO786 At the beginning of Season 1 this show had an edge but the show has been watered down.David Strhairn's character has been softened and the writer's can't seem to balance the timethey give to each character."
B008JSO786 Before boring old monotheism there were groups of gods who had adventures. Zeus and Hercules were always getting into trouble, often with other enhanced beings. In Alphas this kind of story lives again."
B008JSO786 Because it's very interesting. It just keeps getting better.the stars fit the people they play. Keep it coming please. Thanks"
B008JSO786 Never heard of this show before coming across it on Prime. Really enjoy it and hope there are more seasons to come."
B008JSO786 I have watched the show from the beginning and simply enjoy the show, looking forward to the next season...I really enjoy the actor &#34;Gary&#34;, having watched him on another series &#34;Bones&#34;, he does a great job as his character."
B008JSO786 One of my favorite movies is Sneakers...very good movie. Robert Redford, River Phoenix, David Strathaim . When I see he is in a TV show and it is on my Prime free list I could not resist. I enjoyed the few I watched. Try it you may enjoy it also. Well written."
B008JSO786 I'm so happy to see my show back on, I had to do some catch-up. But yes it's as good as every. Love this show. rebieanna"
B008JSO786 SyFy channel presenting thesecond season with the old crew back and a new member added.The most powerful member the \"pusher\" goes AWOL and out of control for  a while which is interesting (and then some). The autistic savant is rescued from a government facility- and a bunch of bad mutants escape which reforms the team to out and recapture them along with trying to find the series's \"Professor Moriarty\" ie a mutant who apparently has been alive since the 1800's and is masterminding the upcoming Mutant War (while denying he is trying to do this of course).A lot of fun"
B008JSO786 It was a great sci fi adventure which keeps your interest throughout. It was well worth the time of watching."
B008JSO786 Another good show bites the dust thatnks to Fox' who gives a crap about the viewer attitude. It's just another example of why people are watching cable stations instead of the dinosaurs of braodcasting like Fox."
B008JSO786 The actors on this show are doing an outstanding job. Unfortunately, the rotating cast of writers is not. The technical, physical and visual effects have been excellent. I'm looking forward to season three. Something I can't say for all television shows out there. The pacing (for a weekly) is quite brisk, the challenges continue to evolve, as do the characters. Hopefully the producers will keep the show on the right track by avoiding some poor writer choices."
B008JSO786 The series has lost its way and is not as focused as it was in season one.  The resurrection of the bad guy, a real &#34;Mr. Evil&#34; was a cheap shot at plot control. The rest of the cast are just a weak...  Thank heavens there was a 3rd season when things improved.RSC"
B008JSO786 As I began watching Alphas, I found myself waiting days and weeks between episodes. But, by the middle of the first season, the show really started taking off. I watched the entire second season in a few days - watching 3-4 episodes at a time. That's when I found out it had been cancelled. I don't like watching shows, no matter how great, that only have a season or two. Alphas left me wanting more - I want to know how the characters continue to develop, what new characters come into play, where the storyline goes, and what happened after the season-ending cliffhanger. I'm disappointed, to say the least. But if you're in the camp of &#34;better to have loved and lost...&#34; then by all means watch Alphas. You'll enjoy the all-too-short ride.Side note: My favorite character was Gary, the autistic genius with &#34;special&#34; abilities. Great acting, brother!"
B008JSO786 I liked the characters just when there story lines were being developed the show endedApparently superhero shows can't magically keep there audience coming back each week"
B008JSO786 I don't know how I missed this series when it was on tv...wow.  This show is so much better than 95% of the crap they feed us anymore---just how many survival, bachorlette, extreme this or that, cooking shows can they make?  Between Falling Skies,Defiance,Justified,& Longmire, that's about all the decent viewing choices on.  This needs to be brought back -- lots of potential, and love the action.  Could have another Fringe on your hands!!"
B008JSO786 Another wonderful series that I somehow missed when I had a TV.  Now I'm streaming from Netflix and Amazon and have stumbled onto some very well done series.  I'm so glad I have the opportunity to watch them now at my leisure but best of all WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!"
B008JSO786 This series has become too 'conflict intensive'.  This is destroying the entertainment value of the series.  Red Flag's murderous and destructive propensities are far too intense for this subject material.  Little less love making, and more 'wins' for the FBI and the alpha team and a couple more episodes with Skylar would be a lot more fun for the viewer, in my very humble opinion."
B008JSO786 and this season has not disappointed me yet.  It's a unique swing on the \"X-men\" concept for me, except these guys are just a little more human in their characters."
B008JSO786 Alphas is full of normal folks with super powers in one particular area.  They are flawed. No perfect endings.  I love that they have a person with a disability (autism?) who contributes and is not treated like a mascot."
B008JSO786 This is a great show that shows that being supernatural does not mean you do not have personal issues and you cannot save the world in 1 hour. I loved the characters that had different abilities and personalities. The running arch was ongoing but if you miss an episode you can catch up. They give an autistic character a major role and he is an internal part of the team, not a person who needs to changed.This show is terrific and you should be able to watch it over and over, it is that good"
B008JSO786 I really loved this show.It was packed full of different kinds of action and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Can't wait till the next one comes out. I will deffinetly watch any further shows that  come on."
B008JSO786 One of the best sci-fi types if you ask me. Great cast, with a wide variety of character types, attitudes, and so forth. The scripting is reasonable for the genre and the tv episode time frame and they pack a lot in, in each episode."
B008JSO786 The second season of Alphas strayed off course a bit with the violence and government heavy-handedness taking over.  It's still a fine show, but I would like to see less violence and guns going off."
B008JSO786 This episode really brought out the best in the characters, and highlighted the tensions brought out by the sudden exposure of Alphas to the world. I love the intricate nature of the plotting of these shows, and how they arc across several episodes while each individual episode stands alone."
B008JSO786 First rate actors in highly believable roles. The story lines are well thought out and rarely fail to catch my full interest no matter how ticked off I get at some of the ways they screw up and then live with the consequences. I like the way they have developed the character Gary especially. Great show that I enjoy watching - highly recommend if you are looking for more humanity and less violence."
B008JSO786 This show is an example of creative minds at their top level of writing performance.  The idea which is similarly used in the X-Men series, is taken several steps farther into the future and leaves the viewer with the feeling that we are getting closer and closer to the possibility that the technology suggested could actually become our present."
B008JSO786 This show is awesome, it only gets better as they continue the season. Season 2 is a much darker season then the first, gritty and suspencful. I hope they continue this series since in my opinion it is top shelf."
B008JSO786 A well done series. Good TV programmes are hard to come by but when they materialize they are good. Except for the psychologist role, which is whiny, psychobabble nonsense, the other roles were complex and full of possibility. Alphas' supermutants eclipsed in realism, drama a
B008JSO786 This drama is about Alphas,human beings born with either enhanced senses or powerful physical and mental abilities.The background story deals with a group of Alphas who want to protect normal humans from one evil Alpha, so clever and powerful that he has a chance to alter the world as we know it.My husband and I love science fiction and fantasy, so this was right up our alley.  We watched both seasons quickly because they were like eating potato chips.  At the end of the second season, we were sad that more seasons were not available at this time."
B008JSOXLW I started watching White Collar late in the game and went backwards to catch up on all the episodes from the first 2 seasons. I really love Matt Bomer in this role. I love the relationship between Peter and Neal and the newest suspicious addition to the White Collar family this season."
B008JSOXLW White Collar is one of the best shows I have watched in a while. I actually just started watching it but I bought all of the previous 3 seasons and am now caught up. Can't wait for season 5."
B008JSOXLW it was great show and it kept getting better better better and i cant wait for 5th season. it worth to buy season 4!"
B008JSOXLW Neal is a great character because he is both good guy and bad guy. He works with the FBI, but the viewer knows that he and Mozzy still hold all of the Nazi art - a fact Peter isn't aware of, but that strains credulity, especially after Neal and Mozzy were living large incognito in the season premiere so best that the viewer ignores that entirely.In this episode, Neal and Peter host a panel at an FBI conference detailing why their partnership works and why Peter chose him. In a sweet scene, especially given the tension of late between Peter and Neal over the disappearance of Sam, Peter tells Neal that he chose him to be his partner because he liked him - hopefully making Neal feel at least a little guilty about all the ways he is deceiving Peter. The con of the week is fair this week. The real action centers on Sam, just who he is and what the truth is about Neal's father and the crimes that tore Neal's family apart when he was a child. Peter is convinced that Sam isn't who he says he is and tries to convince Neal to let him help. Instead, Neal and Mozzy con Peter. Peter is really very patient with all of Neal's shennanigans. In the final scene, it is revealed who Sam really is but the bigger questions about the past remain unanswered. A good episode of White Collar after a very solid season. I will be watching the next half of the season with interest."
B008JSOXLW My Family Loves this Show! Keep it Coming! Most excellent acting, plot line, characters and character development. Wow! This show rocks!"
B008JSOXLW Great characters with trust, but often strained relationships dealing with unique problems in unconventional ways. I highly recommend this fun and adventurous getaway!"
B008JSOXLW Great series !  Definitely want to see more of these and similar series also.  Am now working my way through Mad Men, but will be willing to return to White Collar as available."
B008JSOXLW Love these show! The characters are funny and convincing and we can't wait to see what the next season brings!"
B008JSOXLW Year after year, I am never disappointed with White Collar.  Suspenseful, dramatic, funny, quirky, and no ongoing (if any) graphic and/or gory violence; what more can one ask for?Also, Matt Bomer is very very very easy on the eyes.  Bummer he's married."
B008JSOXLW If you have never watched this show you should! Not only is their strong writing, but the acting is superb and the characters are ones that you will quickly come to love! In each of the episodes in this season you get drawn into some great mystery, intrigue and action. For me, this is the type of show that will leave you on the edge of your seat asking for more!* I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*"
B008JSOXLW This show, while not an original concept, is a fantastict version of an old concept.  Every character is important.  Mossy is invaluable, and of course the main characters on right on spot with what is not only needed, but apprecieated, in remaining true to character at all times.  Great writing, great follow thru with storylines, and great dialogue. Enjoy!!"
B008JSOXLW I've always enjoyed White Collar, as silly as it is, because of its stylish take on NYC.  But in the last few episodes, it's lost some of the features that anchor at least my interest.  If anyone's paying attention, then:1. We don't need a psychobabble back story for Mozzie2. What happened to the women?  Elizabeth is sorely underused; Diana is barely present; Sara is nowhere to be seen.  These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor, class, and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story.  Bring 'em back!  In fact, a few episodes where the boys are locked up somewhere and it's up to the girls to rescue them would help a lot.3. Is there a writers' strike on?  The actors look embarrassed delivering some of that dialogue."
B008JSOXLW neal, peter and moz (along with the rest of the crew) keeps it going each and every week.  i just hate the long mid-season break.  i always watch the last show to catch up with the action before screening the new season.  lets keep this show on the air!"
B008JSOXLW My husband and I both love con shows. This show sure gives it to us. Couldn't wait to see Season  4, and it didn't disappoint us."
B008JSOXLW This &#34;con-man with a heart of gold&#34; is sexy, smart, charming and a cautionary tale that men like this are high-risk involvements so don't expect much in the way of commitment.  What saves this show from moral ambiguity is the basic goodness and sense of justice toward the individual.  My favorite show, by far, due mostly to Matt Bomer.  Yeah, he's gorgeous, but he's also a great actor.  I love watching him act, that subtle weight shift with the slight smirk (and many other such moments each episode) just blow me away.  Plus twice a year there is a fabulous, original stunt.  Love the show."
B008JSOXLW Love this show, the characters are continuing to mature. Now, though, finding his long missing father--how many other shows have the same line? Trite at times"
B008JSOXLW I love White Collar because I adore a crime series without blood and gore, and with intelligent, interesting characters.  Of course they are not real, but that is half the fun."
B008JSOXLW Let us set aside for a moment the joy of just watching Matt Bomer walk down the street.  White Collar and I met on an afternoon of boredom and I was quickly an addict.  Each character stands their own ground in a wonderfully chosen cast.  They bounce the excellent writing from line to line like fine pitchers.  And then there's Bomer.  Handsome, elegant, loyal and when necessary just a bit ruthless.  What more do you want?"
B008JSOXLW I like the series and was trying to catch up on what I'd missed, I later stopped watching the series. Oh well you can't love every show."
B008JSOXLW This is a highly entertaining show. Great story line. Hope good shows like this keep going. Good for the whole family"
B008JSOXLW I enjoyed the season that I watched. I was dying to to know where it was going. Not sure will watch the rest of it though."
B008JSOXLW A great show that has clever dialog, interesting characters, good story line and not a lot of violence. I can't wait until the fifth season starts."
B008JSOXLW Love this show!Of course usually when I like a show it gets cancelled-hope that does not happenI love all the characters they are a great ensemble"
B008JSOXLW So, a twist in the storyline meeting the dad who is on the run.  Definitely some new cons and old style tricks to get the corporate criminals and bring justice to the table."
B008JSOXLW Great show with excellent writing and plot twists. A clean show that still provides a little something for everyone in the family!"
B008JSOXLW Absolutely LOVED this series.  My wife and I watched ALL the series in just a month.  Can't wait for more."
B008JSOXLW This is a very pleasant show to watch.  There is always more than one plot going on in any episode.  There is very little violence, which is different than most action/drama shows.  The wife and I both give this 2 thumbs up.  Particularly the wife!"
B008JSOXLW This is a great Show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Neil Caffrey is awesome and one of the best counterfeiters ever. Great show you will not be disappointed!!"
B008JSOXLW We decided to get off satellite TV and still wanted to get our favorite Series, so are buying them by the season.  much cheaper than paying for channels we don't watch.  We enjoy the interaction between the main actors on White Collar, and look forward to the next season."
B008JSOXLW While still full of all the handsome and fashion you expect from a White Collar episode, this was much more action-packed, almost to the level of an episode of Burn Notice."
B008JSOXLW Characters are pretty predictable as are many of the plots, but I like the characters so put up with the lack of imagination."
B008JSOXLW White Collar never disappoints me. Between the recurring cast, guest appearances and plot line, I find this series to be interesting and fun."
B008JSOXLW We're fans of White Collar, so we look forward to each new series we download. (We don't subscribe to cable TV, so we select two TV series to watch each year, in addition to watching some films or specials.  This series is one of the two.)  The writers haven't disappointed us yet, although the running theme that Neal and his FBI handler, Peter, will never learn to trust each other is getting a bit old. In the true story behind the film, &#34;Catch Me If You Can,&#34; the FBI agent and his criminal informant worked well together, remaining good friends even after retirement.  But, I suppose that without the tension of mutual distrust in a running series, the series would run out. So, due to the likeable characters, plots twists, and continuing questions to be resolved, we keep coming back to watch."
B008JSOXLW I love white collar but your streaming is not so great.  it stops and starts A LOT.  I work on my patience when it is time to watch"
B008JSOXLW Always, alway action and intensity.  Love the relationships among the cast of characters.  This series wouldn't be the same without Mozzie!!"
B008JSOXLW The writers have built great characters and given depth. Has humor, romance, adventure - what more would you want?  Great series"
B008JSOXLW Peter takes the show, shooting the \"compromising positions\" photos...with his wife directing him.  Fun episode, with just the right mix of action and comedy."
B008JSOXLW This season was really good. The cast really work's together. I really got into the story lines, it's all coming together."
B008JSOXLW White Collar just keeps getting better and better. I'm an avid fan. Great stories, awesome cast. Season 4 is a must see."
B008JSOXLW This is a well written show performed by a great group of actors.  Some of the cases are a little unreal, but there is the right amount of humor and intrigue to keep you interested.Also, I love the scenes of New York and how they are an integral part of the show. There is a good balance of reality showing the work of the FBI in white collar cases with the humor of Mozzie and his antics in trying to live &#34;off the grid.&#34;Matt Bomer as the perfect charming con artist, Neal Caffrey, shows enough humanity to make you really like him.  Tim DeKay plays a by-the-book FBI agent who lets Caffrey get away with enough scams to make the shows interesting."
B008JSOXLW White collar has always been a refuge from long winters.  Most shows set in New York portray NY as this really gritty city.  White Collar usually shows  clean streets and sunny days.  And I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle."
B008JSOXLW such a fun show. all the twists and turns. neal, peter and mozie are terrific characters. i look forward to season 5.watch a couple of episodes and you will be hooked just like i was."
B008JSOXLW I chose this show because it was something I thought would be easy to watch and fun. I can say it is both of those but it also makes me feel good as it is very cleverly done with great acting and just one of those shows you find yourself addicted to. The stars are perfect for the roles they play and I can't see anyone else playing the characters. Perfect casting!! Love it and them!!"
B008JSOXLW The dynamics in this show are quite amazing. They keep you guessing. Just when you think you know what is going to happen or you think you've got it all figured out something else pops up and you are completely baffled, bit in a good way."
B008JSOXLW Great Series.  I love the cast.  They meld well together and their personalities are all over the place.  They keep you guessing.  Anticipation of what will happen next keeps me coming back week after week and impatiently waiting for the next season to start up again."
B008JSOXLW I love this show!  We don't have cable so Amazon is how I watch new release shows.  The price is reasonable and I don't have to pay for a bunch of stuff I don't want."
B008JSOXLW i have been trying to find this show online and its not available. But with amazon prime its amazing to be able to watch it again."
B008JSOXLW White Collar is one of the best shows on TV.  Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay are so awesome together!!  They really make you feel for their characters and have me laughing all the time.  They rock!!"
B008JSOXLW this is a whole season where the writers take a break and have the characters just do each other ... if u like them all running around with the pms thing and think they're interesting when they do each other, good season.  i prefer the seasons where they reach outside and do the art crimes thing -- wished i wouldn't have bought this one, where they just ... need i say it ... do each other.  there are a few episodes where they don't do each other -  those are good."
B008LRAS5Q Dad, daughter and son all love this. I like the episodes without a villain best. I think nature is enough, but i do appreciate the undertone of conservation.most of all i like the shorts at the end. so jammed packed with knowlege!"
B008LRAS5Q My 4 year old granddaughter watches this a lot and learns about animals she has never seen or heard of before. The program is tastefully done. I find it educational and entertaining for children of her age."
B008LRAS5Q My four year old daughter LOVES this show.  I love it, too.  It's educational and fun.  Glad she can watch something fun and learn, too.  She knows so much now about different animals and what they do.  I recommend!"
B008LRAS5Q I wanted this to download into the Kindles memory so my kid could play this show in the car while on long drives.  Unfortunately it won't play unless you're connected to the net.  Neither can I get a refund.  I'm not very happy."
B008LRAS5Q AWESOME SHOW KIDS LOVE IT AND IT IS VERY EDUCATIONAL. JUST HAD TO LET THE KIDS KNOW WE DO NOT INTERFEAR WITH NATURE. ANAMALS EAT ANIMALS AND THAT IS GOOD FOR THE ECOSYSTEM."
B008LRAS5Q My granddaughter is a fan of Wild Kratts when she comes to my house she asks to watch it.  She is 3 1/2 and will sit through the whole show."
B008LRAS5Q Cris and Martin taught my a lot about animals like mimicry and lots of other things it was a lot of fun watching the Kratt brothers in their mission to save the animals!"
B008LRAS5Q My 5-yr-old and 2-yr-old both really like this show. It's fun and educational (albeit quite fanciful on the invention side). I even like watching it. :-)"
B008LRAS5Q This is such a good show for 5 year olds and above. I really liked it. My 3 year old granddaughter was a little afraid of some parts so its best to censor what is right for your child"
B008LRAS5Q PBS is known for solid and educational kids shows. This one is one of the best of the bunch (curious george being another solid series). fun to watch, it has very brief real life interactions between the kratts brothers and animals before and after each episode, then the episode itself is a cartoon involving the brothers and a certain animal.My kids pick up cool animal facts from this with every episode. I even find it memorable myself and easily fun to watch with the kids. It also has good replay value with the kids.If your kids love animals, they will love wild kratts. Thank you Kratt brothers."
B008LRAS5Q The show is entertaining and educational.  Our kids love watching it everyday.  The series is free for Prime members.  Well worth it."
B008LRAS5Q I love the show and my son loves it even more. It is very good at teaching him information about animals, bugs, plants, and the Earth in general. I always watch the show with him to make sure there is nothing I disagree with...mainly evolutionary problems. For the most part I haven't had any major conflicts. I am Christian and do not believe in Darwin's theory of Evolution. It is true some &#34;micro-evolution&#34; has occurred ...particularly with plants but the idea we have all come from slime or monkey's is not something I believe."
B008LRAS5Q My nephew watches these over and over again. He loves them. I enjoyed them the first time, but beware if you get this because the young kids in your life will probably want to watch the shows multiple times."
B008LRAS5Q There is nothing in this even remotely appealing to kids under 5.  I have a 4 year old nephew and a 5 month old son, and neither looked at the show after the 2nd minute."
B008LRB1O8 Political Animals follows the careers, private lives and fortunes of a former First Family transparantly based on the Clintons. Sigourney Weaver plays Elaine Barrish, the character based on Hillary Clinton and she does a wonderful job. Elaine Barrish was a former first lady who ran for the Presidential Nomination of the Democratic Party and lost to a younger, more media friendly male candidate. Elaine Barrish then campaigned for that President and was named Secretary of State, a role where she did a very good job and that increased her popularity, especially in light of the lackluster performance of the president.Bud Hammond is the Bill Clinton character and Ciarin Hinds does a wonderful job combining both the lovable and the creepy in a man who loves his wife but is incapable of keeping his hands off other women. Political Animals is more of a family drama and soap opera than a political drama, desptie the inclusion of a plot point with hostages in Iran and the tacit permission of the POTUS for Iran to kill American hostages for political purposes, a plot that Elaine dashes rather expertly.I enjoyed Political Animals for its soapy exuberance rather than its political acumen, but the conspiracy nut inside of me thinks that the purpose of Political Animals is to float the idea of Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, running for President again based on her performance and popularity as Secretary of State. Otherwise why make the characterizations of this political family caricatures?"
B008LRB1O8 this was not great tv but as a first season with sigourney weaver in the lead role, i thought it was promising and worth a second season effort. unfortunately, there will not be one. weaver is loosely based on Hillary Clinton.  she wants to become president.  her ex husband was president.  they divorced because of his womanizing. she currently holds a cabinet post in the government.  one of her sons works for her and the other is having difficulties finding himself.  that he is gay further complicates things. weaver has to ride out a political crisis in this season and also has to make a decision about running for president in the next election.  things are further complicated by her being blackmailed by a reporter into letting her follow her around. this reporter angle was the weakest part of the show. this could have been a great vehicle for weaver and i can only hope something similar is found for her.  i can't see her playing anything but a very strong, very ambitious character."
B008LRB1O8 Really good acting and writing exploring the modern political landscape.Too bad it was conceived as a one season show.  I would have liked to see more."
B008LRB1O8 POLITICAL ANIMALS is being advertised as a limited series so it is doubtful it will be around for more than a few episodes. Maybe that is why it tries to cram so many subplots and shaky character definitions into the space of 1 1/2 hours. The series lists four writers - Greg Berlanti, Geoffrey Nauffts, Molly Newman, and Speed Weed - and perhaps this committee approach is part of the rough result of a script that simply doesn't hang together enough to even whet our interest.Much has been written about this series being a parody of the Clintons: not only is that an unfair evaluation but it is also an insult to the Clintons. But whatever the reason for building this series, the story SEEMS to be the following: Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds in a deplorable and false Southern accent) is an ex-president, a man whose affairs and sexual liaisons have been fodder for the press more than coverage of important data. His ex-wife Elaine Barrish (Sigourney Weaver) is the current Secretary of State to Pop art president Paul Garcetti (Adrian Pasdar). Elaine and Bud have two adult boy children - Thomas (Sebastian Stan) a drug addicted gay loser and Doug (James Wolk) who is about to be married to a Japanese girl with bulimia. Elaine is being followed by a journalist (Carla Guigino) who is more interested in gossip than fact. In the midst of all the parties to meet the bride-to-be's parents, Thomas' attempt to get financing to create a new night club, and Bud's constant parade of busty women, and Elaine's mother (Ellen Burstyn, the best thing about this series) making caustic comments about Bud's girlfriends and the status quo of the nation, along comes an Iran crisis where three American journalists have been captured, tried and are threatened with execution unless someone acts. The President and his numbskull vice president (Dylan Baker) do nothing so of course Elaine as Secretary of State must act with her journalist tagging along, now a bit more understanding because her boyfriend/editor is cheating on her da da da da da. And all of this is delivered with as much profanity as can be stuffed into a show.Sigourney Weaver looks great but doesn't seem convinced about the character she is portraying. Ciaran Hinds doesn't have a chance with the absurd dialogue he barfs out, and the rest of the cast - with the sole exception of Ellen Burstyn who is brilliant and has (who knows why?) all of the dialogue that is intelligently written. Perhaps with the next installments there will be some improvement in dialogue and subplot ideas and less onscreen emesis and coke snorting. If not the series will remain as titled - a brief series. Oh, David Petrarca `directs'. Grady Harp, July 12"
B008LRB1O8 I thought this show was worthwhi
B008LRB1O8 Note: I only saw the first 20-30 minutes with XFinity On Demand.This show, advertised as a \"Limited Series,\" whatever that means, has a great cast (Sigourney Weaver, Ciaran Hinds, Carla Gugino and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn) and a premise that slowly unfolds. What could be the problem?Within the first two minutes, there's a slew of profanity that heretofore you'd think could only be aired on a cable network like Showtime, HBO, Encore, MAX or Starz. That, coupled with the very frank dialogue, was okay with me. I'm merely making a note of this, as the series is TV-PG and the language sounded like it belongs on television series' like Shameless, The Sopranos, etc. PG means that the language, if there's any, is MILD (hell and damn) and infrequent (ie. occurring not more than twice).What really did NOT sit well with me was that there's a sex scene between Bud and Eva. Do they need to show that on television? The show is rated TV-PG. However, the language and sex scene really amped it up to a TV-MA. Then around 15 minutes later, there's a nasty scene between two males. Disgusting. Does every television show these days feel the sick need to throw in one of those people into a show? And even worse, depict them copulating like the male inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah?I turned it off just as the two males were...e[...] Disgusting. Nasty. Anti-biblical. Immoral. Filthy.I DO NOT recommend this series."
B008LRB1O8 This is a good idea wasted.Sigourney Weaver plays a Hillary kind of woman: former first lady, married to a philanderer, later divorced him. Ran for president, lost the primaries against the current democratic president. Accepted Foreign Secretary position, but is not getting along well with the boss. Hates the VP. Considers quitting so that she can run against her boss in the next primaries. Boss smells a rat and offers her supreme court position. She rejects that.The season had only 6 episodes. The first half was quite good, but then it dropped into sheer soap. Production of a second season seems to be unconfirmed. It would need to get much better.There is too much soap in the family story. Twin sons, one of them turned gay and druggie and always prone to cause scandals. The other son seemingly on track as her manager, but with his own issues. Alcoholic mother (a splendid Ellen Burstyn).Press relations too soapy. One female reporter seems to hound her, but actually admires her... you get the picture. (This person is hard to watch without screaming.)And the world doesn't behave as it should. Not the Russians, not the Ayrabs, and not the Chineses.After all, a disappointment. Pity. Second season not required."
B008LRB1O8 Excellent cast, great script and lots of intense drama make this outstanding television.Watched in one sitting and extremely disappointed it was prematurely terminated as the stories were only just beginning to get momentum.Oh well, there are so many quality TV shows these days it can be challenging for a new series to get sufficient recognition to sustain it.A great pity. I hope it's not long before we see Sigourney Weaver and Ellen Burstyn back on the small screen."
B008LRB1O8 Very well written, acted and directed and Sigourney is the highlight of the show. What an actress she is! Bravo! So rare to see a mature woman in a lead role and what a job she does!"
B008LRB1O8 Interesting idea, not the first time that it's been tried before. I liked \"Commander in Chief,\" the short-lived series about a woman president, better, because it didn't try so hard to play off real people. Sorry to be the lone dissenter, it seems, and this will undoubtedly sound trivial and sexist (and probably is), but:I was offended by the absurdly high and ugly waistbands they dressed Sigourney Weaver in to hide her thick middle-aged waist. They didn't do that to the men with their middle-aged paunches.It amazes me that whoever cast this thought anyone would think that Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is sexy enough to appeal to so many women (he's very unattractive, to me, and what's with that mouth downturned mouth that's apparently an affectation?) or that someone as attractive as Susan Berg, who played the reporter, would find whoever it was who played the editor she worked for attractive in the least (definitely not). And surely they could have found a lot of men to portray the character based on Bill Clinton better and something more substantive for the character to be than such a pathetic sex and power monger.Most of the plots were just silly, not developed, way too contrived.Sigourney Weaver was fine in the part and in her acting as Secretary of State and would-be President. And I liked Ellen Burnstyn and her portrayal of the sniper-witted, functional alcoholic mother of the Secretary of State (do you see a problem there?). But I found some of actors, much of the acting, and most of the dialog (writing) insulting to anyone with average intelligence. An embarrassment, basically."
B008LRB1O8 So disappointing....I assume A LOT OF Talented people were involved in creating this show.You are stuck....walk into a door....run until you drop....but, don't continue until youshow us more then 'bonking' and loose zippers.  What happen to the original idea?  You havelost the mojo.  Hopefully you can pull it together."
B008LRB1O8 Ok guilty pleasure here I like Sigourney Weaver. While we all look at her like a the Hillary Clintonesque model I just don't find this version of Hillary believable ...I mean the presidents plane slips? what are the wheels made out of roller skates?"
B008LRB1O8 Sigourney Weaver is a marvelously talented actor, and the role of Elaine Babbish elevates her to a new level. This is her show! It is said this is a take off of Hilary Clinton, and in some senses it is. Her ex-husband was thevPresident, she ran for thePresidency to lose to a younger, charismatic man, and she serves her country as Secretary of State. The similarities end there. This SOS seems to be the only cabinet member who has a sense of ethics, with a know how presence to proceed.Beside Elaine's political life, she has a family. Twin sons, the good one is her Chief of Staff, the not so good one, a drug addict homosexual. A lot to load on one person, ey? Her mother lives with hem, she is a former play girl, now focused on her alcohol. The ex-husband played by Ciran Hinds is a bumbling fool, and he des not do the role justice.A newspaper journalist, Susan Berg, played by the gorgeous, Carla Guien, has the real meaty role. She has written nasty articles about Elaine, and now has blackmailed her to gain entrance to follow her in her every day job. They form a friendship of respect of sorts, and Susan Berg plays a large role in this series. We learn a great deal about the Elaine Babbish and her family via Susan. An inside look so to speak.Into the second year as SOS, Elaine Babbsh decides she must run for the presidency to save the US from it's present leader. This causes all sorts of difficulties for everyone involved. Within the six episodes of this series we see the inside world of Washington, and the political families that inhabit these lives. This is an excellent series, well written, well acted with superb characters. I was sorry to read that the series would not be renewed. I surmise the ratings were not great. Too bad, this is the kind of television that is good for everyone.Recommended. prisrob 08-03-13"
B008LRB1O8 I loved this series Political Animals: The Complete First Season I hope they do a second season. The cast that they picked for this series is what makes this series works."
B008LRB1O8 I love this show. It has great acting and a very good plot line each week. I want to see it continue for a long time."
B008LRB1O8 I liked the first couple of episodes until I realized this wasn't about a story involving governing or politics, like West Wing, but government was just the story in which a soap was told. Could have been much stronger."
B008LRB1O8 This is one of the most disappointing pilots for a TV show that I have ever seen. I couldn't even get past the first 8 minutes. Who is that horrible man playing Sigourney Weaver's husband? He's terrible! She was awful in the role. If that was supposed to be Hillary Clinton.........what a joke. Not even close and not even remotely similar to Bill Clinton.Terrible, terrible show! I am requesting a refund ($1.99)."
B008LUC32E &#8230;and I miss it even though I thought the series was getting weaker with time. I need to actually watch the DVD's to refresh my memory but, just looking over the episode guide a few episodes stand out to me.1. The (Very) Big Bird Job- they either got to use the real &#34;Spruce Goose&#34; or went to a great deal of effort faking things.2. The D.B. Cooper job- a retelling of the real story, one of the stories using the cast in dual roles, maybe better than &#34;Big Bird&#34; At least in these two stories the writers put in some effort to create something &#34;resembling&#34; reality.3. The Real Fake Car Job-  in which a crook is conned into &#34;buying&#34; a car from the gang.The weakest, in it's ending at least, is 4. The Long Goodbye Job. It ends with Nate & Sophie leaving the team to get married- leaving the others to carry on. I don't know what I'd have done but I'd have written something different.Always entertaining, even if there is almost always something implausible about a story- this band of reformed criminals is worth watching, my favorite TNT show. I'll miss them."
B008LUC32E This ensemble cast shines together, even if the storylines grow stale. Looks like they're going to try something new, a little separation anxiety to keep the plates spinning next season."
B008LUC32E I love this show so much. The premise of the show was so unique compared to all of the other shows out there. I love the ending but am so sad that it's over. I would love to see a spinoff with Parker, Elliot, and Hardison. It would be epic!"
B008LUC32E Thank you for a series that was funny, irreverent and entertaining for 5 seasons.  I will miss it the same way I miss reading new Calvin & Hobbes comics - grateful I had 5 seasons to enjoy the show and ever hopeful the creators and cast will change their minds and do it again.This series is well written and well acted. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes seeing bad people pay for the crimes they commit.The last show had a lot of call backs to the first show which I really enjoyed.It is DVD worthy and I urge you not to take my word but watch it and see for your self.Thank you again Dean, Tim, Gina, Aldis, Christian and Beth.I look forward to seeing what you all do next."
B008LUC32E i wish they allowed them to stay on longer.  I think this version got rushed along but I'm sure if they had more time for another season they would have developed everything wonderfully.  It is always entertaining and a show that should not have stopped so suddenly especially since they had good ratings for both of the last seasons and would have had even more success had they not been rushed to end with the last season before it really got started."
B008LUC32E This episode really shows Christian Kane's depth as an actor. It really was &#34;his&#34; episode. I never get tired of watching the show."
B008LUC32E I have purchased all of the other seasons and was so upset to hear that this show was cancelled. I loved every show and I'll go further to say that this season was excellent and I'll purchase it when it comes out in dvd."
B008LUC32E Great series to watch. Timothy Hutton does a great drunk who is trying to stop. He gets these thieves to vwork on the good side oh and Elliott is just hot!"
B008LUC32E I was one of those who came late to the Leverage party. Consequently, I didn't get the pleasure of watching and discussing with other fans of the show. The DVD with and without Commentary allows me to watch my favorite shows while also listening to commentary from the writers, directors, actors. And much like many fans of Christian Kane, the pleasure is watching him as Eliot Spencer. Listening to the commentary is a lot of fun because Devlin & Rogers often comment on small nuisances that Kane does in his acting performance that I admit to having missed on the first watch. They will talk about a facial expression or a line delivery or something small that they admit expands his acting range. It's no wonder that they tapped him for their newest series The Librarians on TNT.Any fan of the show is encouraged to get the DVD for the commentaries alone but also to watch their favorite episodes over-and-over. It's been my pleasure to watch and see things that I missed in the first watch."
B008LUC32E loved this episode! Are they all getting more good looking as the show progresses? Woderfull! It felt very action movie-ish. Christian Kane was smoldering!"
B008LUC32E Wonderful chemistry between the cast members and plot lines that are interesting and fun for the adults but still appropriate for kids to watch, too."
B008LUC32E As a leverage fan, I was very excited to see this DVD come out (though sad to know that it was the last season too). After watching this I have to say that this was a great finale of a wonderful series (IMHO). In the five seasons that it ran you were taken through an emotional roller coaster, but the writing was strong and you were always given the twists and turns that at least I know that I grew to expect in the series itself. In this season, you get the last 15 episodes and what episodes they were! I also have to commend the writers at sending the series off in the right way and giving viewers the closure that they deserve. This is a great set that any fan will love!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*"
B008LUC32E i am so very sorry that the leverage gang will be no more.  i know some reviewers had problems with a couple of seasons, but to me, they were invited into my home every week and boy, did we have fun!i wanted to see how parker and hardison were going to progress and will miss elliot cringing at parker but still treated her like his little sister, with nate and the &#34;woman known as sophie&#34; finally jazzed up their relationship.  they will sorely be missed by me.  i have all 5 seasons in my &#34;cloud&#34; and have already started from the beginning to re-see their development from brain, grifter, hacker, thief and demolition man to emerge as a solid and trusted team.what on earth were the powers to be thinking??????"
B008LUC32E i loved this show , i waited very patiently for season 5 to come out so i can have a feast of leverage, i love how they have grown to show respect for the individual talents that makes their :) work look easy"
B008LUC32E Well I cannot write too much about this other than to say that this episode was possibly my favorite and I have watched every episode that has been made.  It left you with a lot more enjoyment and warmth than the usual episode, great stuff.  Kudos to the writers on this one."
B008LUC32E I was not looking forward to the end of this series...butThe Final Season wrapped up all my questions nicely.  I will miss these characters on a weekly basis, but now I can binge on the entire series when ever I want!"
B008LUC32E All 5 seasons were great in their own way.The characters grew without sacrificing the interesting and complicated plot twists.I'm sorry to see it go."
B008LUC32E This season was not bad, but it wasn't my favorite either. I will say despite the series coming to the end 'Leverage' writers left us with super closure. They neatly and heartfully tied it up. The best way to describe the difference would be that season 5 just changed paced."
B008LUC32E I love Leverage, I was sad to see them end it, when we were traveling for a competition my children found this on cable and we fell in love with it, sometimes it was hard to wait for the next season to be available.  I hope they reconsider and bring it back.  I have bought them all and watch them over and over"
B008LUC32E The entire season was hinted towards the ending, however, never figured it would end like it did.  Possible spin off?  Has potential with new players.  Parker is still my favorite with her daring enjoyment of thrills and freefalls."
B008LUC32E This season referenced season 1 a lot.  Really tied it together.  The character development is incredible, you really get to know them before the final episode.  When they filmed the final episode they didn't know whether the show was going to be resigned for a 6th season.  This final episode was worthy of its name."
B008LUC32E This is the best con/heist show out there. The writing, directing, and acting are all top notch, and the chemistry among the cast is impeccable. Wanna see the little guy take down the big bad? Watch LEVERAGE!"
B008LUC32E One of the best episodes.  It was the first time Elliott said something nice to Hardison.  I love this show!"
B008LUC32E This is a very fun series with great writing, acting, and it is perfectly cast. I love these characters. It is always interesting, full of great stunts and humor."
B008LUC32E Leverage returned with flying colors for its fifth season now based in Portland, Oregon.  The quality and ease of purchase of the show through Amazon Prime took away the sting of not being home to see it on cable.  This way I was able to view this season on ROKU or on my laptop.  So far I have not missed an episode but will not be rating each episode separately.  Amazon Prime is a great service for movies or TV, new or old.  I enjoy the free selections, with Amazon Prime, as well as the special situations when I pay extra for viewing my favorite TV shows."
B008LUC32E Absolutely loved all the episodes... Each one of the group has their own speciality. Mostly learned using those gifts as criminals... but now they are like Modern Day &#34;Robin Hood's&#34;... They help those who can not help themselves in the way that is needed. I love all the characters and have watched all Seasons... and will miss them terribly if they do not continue the series..."
B008LUC32E The cast and writing make this an excellent TV series.  Great fun to watch!  THis is one of the more clever television series on TV today."
B008LUC32E Leverage season 5 is awesome.Too bad it is the final season. Timothy Hutton is a awesome actor. I enjoyed watching this show. Its too bad it has to end. They always end the good series too soon."
B008LUC32E I have been a big fan of this show and couldn't wait for the final season to come out on DVD.  I wonder if they had different writers for the final season, because most of the episodes seemed to be a typical formula show like most show on TV these days.  I especially hated the way the series ended and I am glad that it ended when it did, because I think a sixth season would have been a disaster!"
B008LUC32E I feel the producers wrapped up this series the right way.  You weren't left with a cliffhanger.  In fact, you leave with the possibility that they could all come back again.  A fun show."
B008LUC32E Back to the basics, with no overarching or nefarious villlan. Great episodes, great character development. It focused more on the interactions with each other (as a team) as well as the clients. Sad it's not coming back."
B008LUC32E I Love this show!! I could watch it over and over again all day. Excellent episode, excellent season, Excellent show!! Highly recommend it!!"
B008LUC32E Sadly, this is the last season of a great con-artist(s) show. Leverage is one of the high spots of television over the past few years and was filmed largely in the Pacific Northwest. The team has moved to Portland, Oregon, (and no longer is pretending that Portland locales are Boston. Like the last couple of seasons, there is an underlying thread to the stories which are told each week. Altogether, this show has provides us with a chance to see its performers bring to life varying personalities as they attempt to pull a con on con men."
B008LUC32E The first time I watched the show Leverage I was hooked . I like the way all the characters mingle with each other. All the characters play such great roles which makes the show Leverage work."
B008LUC32E This show is pure television entertainment. The characters are fun to watch, and the stories are lighthearted and entertaining. I recommend watching this show!"
B008LUC32E A terrific series continued, too bad this is the end.  We have really enjoyed the &#34;Robinhood-ish&#34; stories of Leverage. All the characters are so unique and yet work well with each other in the storyline."
B008LUC32E I love these shows.  They are very entertaining.  I have all the seasons and enjoy them over and over again.  The final season wraps it up nicely."
B008LUC32E this is a favorite series of ours. I was sad to see it end, It is witty, good dialogue and just fun."
B008LUC32E This is one of many series that we hated to see end.  So as always I bought it to be able to watch it as many times as I feel necessary since they aren't making more."
B008LUC32E Always a great series. Why do I need more words just to get the thing done here. The last two sentences are redundant."
B008LUC32E Leverage appeals to the heart of justice.  It is always a fun, witty and compelling show that hits right at what people need the most, justice.  Sorry to see it end."
B008LUC32E I love this show - everything about it.  It's funny, smart and fun!  Man is Christian Kane HOT! Love all the characters."
B008LUC32E Leverage, especially Timothy Hutton, was one of the best shows on TV.  I have every season on DVD.  Hated that this was the last."
B008LUC32E Leverage, all seasons, is the best series for fun! A bit of suspense, and not much swearing that is hard on the ears."
B008N6X3BG The 10th anniversary season ofProject Runway: The Complete Eighth Seasonopens in Times Square with Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn, Nina Garcia, and Michael Kors. The competing designers bring their own outfits, and they are tasked with making another design for the Tomes Square catwalk. It's a creative concept and it works. It's a relief to see Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn back after their absence in Project Runway All-Stars. It was great to see Mondo Guerra's win in Project Runway All-Stars... but the absence of Heidi&Tim;, there was a void. Luckily, Heidi&Tim; are back for the new flock of contestants. The contestants talk about the worldviews behind their designs. Dimitri is very precise; Buffi is into wildness&animal; prints; Van is into elegance. It's a great comeback!"
B008N6X3BG I have been a fan of Project Runway from the beginning. I have every series they have every aired, With me being a Fashion Major in college this has been a great help to me to let me see the inside of the fashion industry. Thanks"
B008N6X3BG i enjoyed this episode because of the nature of the challenge. work clothes for women has to be as real world in fashion as one can get. marie claire now has a special magazine for this and notes it is a very fast growing market niche. this is a team challenge and there is a lot of personal drama because the contestants hate working in teams.i think the results came out as particularly useful for the working woman in New York City. the winner was very leading edge and pushing the envelope.  it would take awhile to catch on elsewhere. but that's ok.  fashion is always looking ahead.two examples show the risks one takes with complex construction techniques. raoul's blouse is very complex because of one layer after another put on the very front in a black filmy material.  i am not sure if this is supposed to be pleating.  this was a disaster. the technique was overly fussy and not executed well.  the fabric was a bad choice for working women and for this technique. by contrast, christopher works on changing the texture of the fabric in a skirt. the fabric is a pretty print and it looks like cotton broadcloth which is a good choice for this technique.  this gives a new dimension to the fabric. although the fabric is now more complex, he makes the construction of the skirt itself simple.  this works very well.another mistake is huge sleeves on a jacket.  the last thing a woman wants to battle at work is a giant sleeve construction at her shoulders. the number one criteria for work clothes should be fluidity and huge sleeves miss that by a mile.interestingly, the contestants who work worst in the team environment have the worst designs. i think they spend a huge amount of time caught up in the drama of the team dynamic rather than in thoughtful design work. i think concentrating on reconstruction of the fabric itself into a simple garment, like the skirt, is a useful way to make it through these team challenges.  that way you have a great piece for judging that will also not clash with your other team members' work. another team member's jacket over this skirt was not very good but the skirt still worked with it.also, i would have relied more on the experts doing the photo shoot rather than trying to redesign their set like elena did.  she got so caught up in the props and the set that she forgot about the power these people have with their cameras. the last thing i would want to do with professional fashion photographers is second guess their ideas on setting up the stage for a fashion shoot."
B008N6X3BG I have always loved this show. I like to see all the great new designers out there. Am always shocked by the things that the good designers come up with."
B008N6X3BG I cannot beleive how creative the designers are when they are under that much pressure.  I could not do it, that is for sure.  I just wish the series came on more than once a year.  Gotta love Tim Gunn too."
B008N6X3BG Have every season from this series and can't wait for next one.  Seems to be getting more variation in designers where you are pretty sure who will be voted off pretty quickly."
B008N6X3BG IF YOUR A SERIES FAN, YOU WILL LOVE THIS..IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! I PERSONALLY DONT LIKE IT WHEN THEY DO THINGS LIKE TAKE THEM TO A HARDWARE STORE AND HAVE THEM MAKE THINGS FROM ITEMS THERE...THATS STUPID...BUT IT MAKES FOR ENTERTAINMENT!"
B008N6X3BG This is the 10th anniversary of Project Runway and it seems to recapture the magic of the show.  Designers are strong and very opinionated throughout the entire season.  It is a good ride."
B008NNY1U6 This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.The film begins with a shot of Goode's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just becausea customer wanted it more well-done.Afterwards we were introduced to Goode' ex(?)-wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumpedinto him.  Then someone was in the hospital(dying?) and tears were shed.I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and notremembered them in correct orders.What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior.  There were a lot in the movies.It was the annoying non-linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why can't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non-linear?Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.Using non-linear filming style must have its justifications.The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least,and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end."
B008NNY1U6 I watched this movie for one reason and one reason only -- Matthew Goode.  He is such a talented young actor that I have made it a mission to watch every one of his recent films.  I must admit that it was a bit of a slog watching &#34;Burning Man&#34; and yet I'm glad that I persevered to the end.  The frenetic editing took some getting used to but in the end it came together.  Goode's portrayal of this tormented man is quite remarkable and should have received a great deal more recognition.  I may take the leap and re-watch it for that reason alone.  Don't watch this film if you're into the cookie cutter mold.  However, if you are up for a challenge, give it a go.  Goode will not disappoint you."
B008NNY1U6 Seeing a story about grief and loss in reverse is an interesting twist; without giving too much of  the story a Chef looses his wife to cancer and is forced to raise their son by himself.  He is lost with grief ,  trying to comprehend on  how to move forward with raising his son, and to  continue to run his resteraunt.  As can be imagined  the weight of all this human drama is crippling, leads to some very nasty confrontations, and a car crash.  This is a really a good film."
B008NNY1U6 When I sat down to view the Australian drama \"Burning Man,\" I had no idea what to expect.  I like both Matthew Goode and Rachel Griffiths, but I had never heard of the movie itself.  I'm certainly not prone to unnecessary hyperbole (no comments like \"greatest movie ever\") but, truthfully, this film blew me away.  A complete surprise, \"Burning Man\" may be one of the biggest sleepers of the year and I wonder why it hasn't received more notice stateside.  It boasts a career best performance by Matthew Goode.  A great character actor, Goode here showcases a fiery passion and raw energy that should be gaining him award attention.  He's that good!  The movie is structured in a series of fragments that cut back and forth through time.  You really do have to pay attention as you try to piece together the narrative timeline.  But as the heart of the story starts to come into focus, its poignancy and power really start to resonate.  Writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky has assembled the fragments masterfully in a way that makes this a visceral experience as much as an emotional journey.Goode plays a temperamental chef in a fashionable Sydney eatery.  From the beginning, the screenplay almost slaps you with its aggression.  Goode is unpleasant, volatile, desperate, and explosive.  It's a big and showy role, and Goode devours every scene he's in.  But as more and more of the story reveals itself, you start to see a certain shading--a reason and logic for his explosive personality.  I won't provide any spoilers as the movie really should unravel at its own pace.  Let's just say that Goode is a troubled soul that needs to piece his life and his psyche back together.  And like a good puzzle, the movie stands as a metaphor for his internal struggle and his efforts to feel complete again.  The further we progress, the more stripped down Goode's performance gets.  And as his naked vulnerability emerges, you'll really root for this wreck of a man to embrace the possibility of a new future.I know that some people might loathe the narrative scramble.  If you require things entirely linear or spelled out, \"Burning Man\" might not be the movie for you.  But instead of feeling like a director's trick, the fragmented storytelling is an integral part of demonstrating the chaos and mix of emotions that define its leading man.  Goode is front and center in every scene and he is up to the challenge.  \"Burning Man\" is an intense experience that has lingered with me since watching the movie.  An easy recommendation for serious minded viewers, I loved this movie.  It has the ability to shock and disturb you, but also to really get under your skin as a tender and powerful love story.  Teplitzky's \"Burning Man\" may easily be one of my favorite films of the year, made all the more surprising in that I had no such expectations when I sat down to watch it.  KGHarris, 11/12."
B008NNY1U6 Although this film has no mentally ill characters, it reminds me of Peter Falk's greatest performance in \"A Woman Under The Influence.\" The audience is deprived of the tools to make a fair judgement of this man until the last half of the film.  This is a great use of non linear story telling because the emotions truly are experienced in isolated segments.  Every adult should see it."
B008NNY1U6 The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch.  Too deep for my taste.  I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters."
B008O2QERY My three year old daughter LOVES these guys!!!  I wish they would make some new shows though.  I have seen each episode at least six times each."
B008O2QERY My son is 9 and LOVES the Wild Kratts. These are 2 funny guys who have a great time with animals. They don't dumb it down or use irritating repetitive songs so I've found myself taking a break and enjoying an episode here and there also. I strongly recommend this program for any kid who has curious about the great outdoors, animals of all kinds and having fun."

B008OIH7AQ They say that \"birds of a feather flock together,\" and often this expression is true.  After all, supposedly Russell Wiliams and Paul Bernardo were college buddies at the University of Toronto, and they both seemed to enjoy killing women -- independently, however -- and filming it all while they did it.  Perhaps the expression should be changed a bit for these partners in crime; a one-word change should do.  I'll let you guess which word that is.I watched a Youtube video of the interrogation of Mr. Williams, which was quite riveting, and so I've wanted to watch this film for quite a while.  Sure, \"An Officer and a Murderer\" was made-for-TV, and even surer, it was on the Lifetime Network.  So with apologies to Lifetime, you'd expect it to be blah at best.  But you'd be wrong.  It's actually a really decent police procedural, although supposedly, most procedurals are fiction while this is mostly fact.  (I read part of someone else's review that complained about inaccuracies about this film, but I'm not sure either way yet.)In particular, I think that the Canadian Laura Harris, who plays Detective Jennifer Dobson, is really solid here.  I don't know if a female detective was actually on the real-life case, but in this case, it wouldn't bother me if not.  But I found her performance to be really believable, not over-the-top like so many crime films that you've seen before.  I thought that Gary Cole was probably a good choice to play the colonel, and while watching I tried to consider other actors that might have been better but I drew mostly a blank.  (It's not usually important to me that an actor looks exactly like who he is playing, but is rather a good actor that's able to pick up on base mannerisms without going into caricature.  And I think that Mr. Cole fits that bill.  If you watch the true interrogation, and the reenactment here, you should notice that Mr. Cole picks up on those mannerisms well.)I haven't read any books on this case yet, but I probably will sometime down the road, as I've already pushed one on my Wish List queue.  It was a pretty unbelievable case, and it must have been a huge embarrassment to Canada as a whole to put someone like this in such a high-ranking position, only to determine his true colors later.  And those true colors were more than dark, much darker than the standard blues that he wore most days.Back to real life. . . .  From what I understand, there was a point where Mr. Russell and Mr. Bernardo were being held at the same prison, but I don't know if that is still true.  In any case, hopefully Canada finds both of these guys to be \"dangerous offenders\" since it seems that Canada's \"life sentence\" is only 25 years otherwise.  I believe that the \"dangerous offender\" title allows Canada to keep someone in prison for longer than that, actually up to a true \"life\" sentence; not too many people only live 25 years.  Perhaps Canada should reconsider the death penalty?  If they did, surely both of these friends might be candidates for it, although to be fair, due to double-jeopardy laws, even still Canada probably couldn't force a new sentence on them after the fact.If you watch this film -- and I give it a pretty strong recommendation that you do -- I would rent it in HD on your Roku box, like I did.  It looked and sounded great."

B008OIH7AQ This movie made me go check every door and window in my house before I went to bed.  If you like real drama this is it."
B008OIH7AQ I really liked Gary Cole.....he did a good job in this movie....but Fatal Vision....another true military officer who killed his entire family....was better. While creative liberties were taken regarding the retelling of Canadian Air Force commander Russell Williams....this movie does give you the basics of the case. The &#34;Tweed Creeper&#34; as papers nicknamed him......went from stealing underwear.....to leaving frightening notes.....to attacks where he photographed his victims in different underwear attire.....to then actually killing. One woman he killed....he knew from the base. This man was in charge of the safety of many Canadian elites and visiting dignitaries....even at one point...the Royals. He was a flight specialists when Prince Charles and Princess Di visited Canada and for the Queen as well. All the while...while it took years....he developed into a cereal killer. This was an okay made for tv movie. If you have time to kill....watch it. If your time is precious....look for another flick."

B008POASKK Bloom does a fair job playing the main character. The plot is failry simple the acting is middle of the road. Personally, I got a little bored with this movie. What amazes me about the movie is how the supporting cast seem to feel he is innocent of any crimes. It so obvious their is something wrong about him."
B008POASKK Fantasy / action mega-god, Orlando Bloom (LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY, PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN 1-50) stars as Dr. Martin Blake. He's six days into his residency, and out to make a good impression. After an incident involving a patient's missed allergy to antibiotics, Blake begins to seem a bit questionable to his superiors. It doesn't help that he's also become obsessed w/ a former female patient. So much so, that he's willing to go to extremely unethical, even dangerously illegal lengths in order to have her back in the hospital. We soon see just what THE GOOD DOCTOR is really all about, and just what he's capable of doing to get what he wants! Bloom is wonderfully low-key in his sinister role. Dr. Blake is a malignant force, so utterly selfish as to not realize how despicable his actions truly are. He is ruthless in a laid-back way that is far more unnerving than any slobbering maniac!  After all, the damage he inflicts is done for &#34;love&#34; and self preservation..."
B008POASKK There really doesn't seem to be enough \"meat\" on this movie to generate much viewer excitement. To the contrary, it is by-and-large a humdrum production, and its main claim to fame may be that the plot is morbidly depressing. Difficult to say why the \"Doctor\" in the story was give such a bad haircut--which was truly distracting. All-in-all, this film would have done better as an okay \"made for TV\" film."
B008POASKK By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiMartin Blake (Orlando Bloom) is a British medical student who has transfered to a Southern California hospital to start his resident.He's handsome, gifted and arrogant, not understanding why he doesn't get more respect.One of his first patients is 18-year-old Diane Nixon (Riley Keough). She has a kidney infection. Martin knows just what to do and before long she's feeling better and able to go home. This worries him, because she has been the only ray of sunshine in his otherwise boring life. Her father invites the young doctor to supper, grateful for his curing of his daughter. Martin shows, only to find all family members are there except Diane. She is out with her boyfriend.Suddenly Martin has a dark thought, an idea to get Diane back under his care. He empties her pills and replaces the medicine with sugar. She relapses and has to come back to the hospital.She has been keeping a diary, putting in fantasies of her own about Martin.He continues to tamper with her treatment to make sure she stays in the hospital, but then the unthinkable happens, she flatlines and dies.Jimmy, an orderly at the hospital, gets ahold of the diary and uses it to get Martin to provide him with narcotics.Now Martin has already killed once, by accident. He begins to ponder how difficult it can be to do it again.It's slow moving and creepy, but the ending flatlines."
B008POASKK I have always liked Orlando Bloom. He is great in this with a beautiful young patient. Doctors can go off the rails just like any of us. Orlando Bloom's character sure did. I did not buy it but enjoyed it."
B008POASKK I guess movie writers and studio exec's think the public are niave or stupid.  Half way through the movie you knew what was coming, very, very predictable.  The only saving grace of this movie was the ending; but then again we as vieweres have seen so many &#34;dream sequences&#34; in both movie and tv, that ending wasn't a surprise either.  Solid acting but here in lies another problem, the characters were not well rounded so you felt no connection to them.  Are we left to pity this Doctor or empathize with him???  Is it business as usual?  I'm sorry, I like Orlando Bloom but this movie is flat from start to finish./"
B008POASKK Orlando Bloom stars as Dr. Martin Blake, a first year resident under the supervision of Chief Resident Waylans (Rob Morrow).  Blake is loner who has a hard time mixing with the staffers.  He has no friends and lives in a stark but kind-of-cool apartment.  An 18 year old girl comes under his care with a treatable urinary infection.  Diane (Riley Keough) has a boyfriend but when they appear to be breaking up, confides in Dr. Blake.  He is smitten with young Diane.When she is released, her family invites Blake over for dinner.  Their motives appear to be one of thanks but to also prompt a romance between Blake and Diane's older sister who is on the make.  Certainly a doctor will do just fine.  Blake has other ideas.  He's only interested in Diane.  Upon a return visit to pick up a gift basket they had prepared (way too many coincidences in this film) he excuses himself to the bathroom where he alters Diane's medication which lands her back in the hospital.Through a series of inexplicably easy access to medication and IV bags, Blake manages to keep Diane hospitalized, to what end I don't know.  I guess the guy is just crazy.  Playing against type, Bloom gives a creepy good performance.  His character has obvious moral conflicts.  What he's doing seems acceptable to him but the filmmakers never explain why.  At the same time, he's outraged when one of the orderlies makes crude sexual advances toward the staff and patients.  The orderly (Michael Pena) is also a pretty obvious drug user.I don't know where this hospital is but I sure never want to go there.  Evidently they have no security, no cameras and lax supervision.  The film also stars award winning actors Taraji P. Henson as the head nurse and J. K. Simmons as a police detective.  Unfortunately neither is given much to do.  Certainly the film had an opportunity to be something more, but when it ends I don't know what it was all supposed to mean.  Fortunately it's only 90 minutes long."
B008POASKK You can't quite call this movie a suspense thriller, although there are certainly suspenseful scenes in it. What's that noise in the back of the medicine room? Who's there? Will he be caught?It's more of a quiet, intense character study. A young doctor becomes obsessed with one of his patients. When she is released from the hospital and seems likely to go flitting off with boyfriends, in social circles removed from him - he arranges to make her sick enough to have to come back to the hospital - to him. He does this in a sort of abstracted state of mind. We are never sure how far he really intends his sickening of the girl to go.But, for a while at least, he succeeds in making her his own, a saintly pallor of a girl transfixed on her hospital bed.This is a compelling, involving movie. It is brilliantly acted. Every character becomes starkly real on the screen - from the randy, self-seeking orderly - to the Doctor himself. If you like low-key malevolence, this is the movie for you."
B008POASKK With the new medical thriller the Good Doctor, British star Orlando Bloom finally comes into his own as an actor of substance and a screen presence to be reckoned with. This represents something of a coming out party, playing the challenging role of Dr. Martin Blake, an unassuming man who wants to be good, but is for some unknown reason drawn towards an evil he just can't help. Bloom is perfectly suited for this role, playing the character appropriately low key, as unassuming, calm and is totally convincing. Bloom, has been an actor that has impressed me little with his career choices, but I have always suspected that there was more to him than what we were getting in movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.Dr. Blake on the surface appears as a kind, friendly, outgoing young doctor who's just arriving at his new post in an American hospital under the supervision of Dr. Waylan (Rob Morrow). However, he quickly has a clash with an outspoken Nurse (Taraji P. Henson) over mistreatment of a patient who doesn`t speak english. He also develops an unsavory fascination with a teenage patient, Diane Nixon (Riley Keough), he soon finds himself tampering with her treatment as to keep her in the hospital, thus keeping her close to him.It's easy to believe that only healthy people would find medical dramas enjoyable,  being a less than healthy person myself having recently spent a spell in a hospital, I haven't ever cared much for the genre in the past, there have also been few great films in of this variety. So I wasn't expecting to actually enjoy this film, I shouldn't have doubted, director Lance Daly has made one of the best, smartest and most sophisticated thrillers in a long while. This is a gem that will appeal to aficionados of classic suspenseful stories especially those from France, recent films such as Tell No One, but also the filmography of noted new waver maestro Claude Chabrol. There is also a touch of the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, present.At a taunt ninety minutes, the Good Doctor is successful in building suspense and a mounting fear of dread. It is not overt, it never descends into graphicness or sensationalism. It allows the audience to wallow in uncomfortable feelings, especially since Dr. Blake is the central protagonist, he's likeable, full of charisma and we find ourselves rooting for him while despising his actions. Blake is a character similar to that of Tom Ripley.None of this would work without the performance of Bloom, which I can't praise high enough, perhaps because of my surprise with it, but also because it is so good. Bloom has too often been dismissed as just a pretty face, but I think his detractors will be quite astounded with his work here. Aided by a strong supporting cast, especially Riley Keough, daughter of Lisa Marie Presley (yes, Elvis' grandbaby!), playing the key role of the object of Dr. Blake's unhealthy obsession. Keough is an actress that I haven't seen much of before, but clearly has the goods to be a future presence in films, she has some interesting stuff in the works.The other pivotal performance comes from the wonderful character actor Michael Pena, soon to be seen in a leading role in End of Watch. Playing Jimmy, an insalubrious orderly who has a run in with the good doctor that leads first leads to animosity, then blackmail and other unsavory deeds. Pena gives the counter performance to Bloom's leading antagonistic hero, crucial in his delivery, Pena goes to show he can stand with the best supporting players working today or any time for that matter. Speaking of the best of supporting players, J.K. Simmons, always a welcome screen presence has a brief, but nicely done cameo as a police detective, here.Not a movie to be easily dismissed or should it be overlooked. Far too many contemporary thrillers are just big, dumb excuses for chases and the eventually duel between hero and villain. The Good Doctor is cut from a different cloth, it is a subtle, deliberately paced, but a very rewarding film. One of the year's very best movies, this is one you'll regret if should neglect to see it.check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B008POASKK Orlando Bloom (who also co-produced) is Dr. Martin E. Blake, a first-year resident physician at a California hospital. Young and ambitious Martin is the pride of his family, and thinking of applying for an infectious disease fellowship. Things are not going well these days, however, for the workload is overwhelming and some co-workers are not very cooperative. He even feels slighted especially by a nurse Theresa (Taraji P. Henson).Martin finds a temporary solace in talking with an 18-year-old patient Diane Nixon (Riley Keough). Diane thinks he is a good doctor, but she is on her way to full recovery and will be soon released from hospital. Plus, Martin knows she has a boyfriend waiting for her. So what would Martin do, whose obsessive side begins to show as the story unfolds?Sorry if my review sounds vague, but this has to be so. All I can say is that \"The Good Doctor\" feels like a well-made two-part TV thriller show of which unique (or incredible) premise you may not take very seriously. While Lance Daly's direction is slick, and cast-against-type Orlando Bloom delivers a solid performance as anxious Dr. Blake, whose obsession gets him involved in unpleasant situations, the film's far-fetched narrative does not convince.Troy Garity appears as easygoing Dan, Martins' colleague; Michael Pe&ntilde;a is Jimmy, an orderly who thinks Martin is too serious; Rob Morrow is Dr. Waylans, Martin's supervising doctor. J. K. Simmons also appears briefly in the film's final act.With Orlando Bloom's chilling performance, \"The Good Doctor\" feels more like a character-driven drama, than a thriller, and as such it delivers."
B008POASKK This sentence summarizes the movie and also the actual mentality of most medical doctors. Everybody wants the Mercedes with the Hopkins plates. Usually is not the most competent person that gets it, but the most politically correct with a lot of friends. Hence, we still have cancer rates as high as 1950 and we don't have any cures/therapies for diseases that should have been eradicated by now. But we have a lots of poor individuals dying painfully from chemotherapy.There are two plots in this movie. In both of them Orlando Bloom performs pretty well as a crazy doctor (Martin Blake) in need of attention from his supervisors. In the first plot the doctor becomes fascinated with a patient and manipulates her drugs in order to keep her in the hospital. This plot failed in my eyes because is totally unrealistic for two reasons. First, the doc has way too much easy access to all the facilities in the hospital. This is totally unrealistic and poorly done. He can come and go freely in the pharmacy and the lab, switching pills and modifying the covers of Petri dishes. Second, if he loves her so much he must know that if she doesn't get her antibiotics she will die and he will lose her. But he is crazy, and maybe a psychopath? That may explain many things. This part of the plot is not very well developed.In the second plot Bloom is in constant need of attention from his supervisors who don't necessarily know more than him, but pretend pretty well, and are used to have patients die on them (...sometimes you have difficult cases; and you did everything by the book, etc...). This part of the plot is really well done and makes total sense in my eyes.The acting is quite remarkable. Orlando Bloom and Riley Keough are just fantastic. The nurse (Taraji P. Henson) and the detective (JK Simmons) are remarkable and add to the movie. JK Simmons reminded me of Columbo!Three stars because of the acting only. The stories are not well developed and the movie could have been a little bit longer."
B008POAZVC I enjoyed The Rites Of Spring to a degree, I just wish that they would have concentrated on the Horror/Slasher aspect of the film instead of taking up so much time with the kidnapping sub plot. I feel they were a bit too ambitious especially with a running time of an hour and 20 minutes.It felt it borrowed from Malevolence and The Messengers 2..I won't say why but you will be able to decipher for yourself.The slasher aspect was very cool, well done and if it had been an entire film about \"The Rites Of Spring\" I would have loved it,the creature was mad cool and the gore was plentiful for the time that story line was given.The characters were interwoven cleverly even though I really had to watch it a second time to really understand how each character was connected.The acting was good for a low budget film especially Anessa Ramsey and AJ Bowen..All in all worth a watch and better than most that are being pumped out lately."
B008POAZVC I've said it before, and, if RITES OF SPRINGS teaches me anything, it's that it often bears repeating: almost anyone with an idea can write and shoot a slasher/horror picture these days, AND almost any studio will distribute it.  The upside?  The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let's say \"less than good\" product, and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare.  The downside?  Well, because the dynamics of producing even a modestly-thought-out idea, video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Don't say I didn't warn you.After killing a local businessman's wife, a group of entry-level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $1 million ransom.  Hiding out in an abandoned school, the team of criminals is surprised when a blood-stained young woman stumbles into their hidey-hole ... with a maniacal axe-wielding killer in pursuit!  Forced to team up for safety, the criminals and the young woman realize they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unless they can cooperate, they're bound to become the lunatic's dinner ... or something.This is Dumb.  Yes, dumb.  With a capital `D.'(NOTE: unfortunately, there's no way to review RITES without some spoilers, folks.  So if you want to know my final rating, then jump down to the last two paragraphs.  However, if you're up for some laughs, then read on!)Writer/director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill-prepared slasher script I've watched in decades.  To his credit, there's some mythology here - apparently, the `barn creature' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring, hence the title - though it makes absolutely no sense.  See, he has a keeper who - for reasons never made clear - catches the women for him.  The `barn creature' can't do it himself (or herself?) because he's kept locked in the cellar of a barn (?!?!) for the rest of the year.Not only that, but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot-looking women, though (again) we're given no logical explanation for that, either.  Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers' fates once we've seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them \"rites\" for a reason, kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good-looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.  Instead, the townies go about their business like nothing's ever happened, and you can what happens from there.Not only that, but these characters aren't fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac's blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife.  There's the bad criminal.  Then, there's the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he's $300,000 in debt.  There's that guy's good-looking girlfriend (can you guess her fate?).  Then there that guy's mistake-prone brother (can you guess his fate?).Not only that, but, technically, the film stinks of amateurism.  Here's a tip: when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand-held camera of any sort, it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then.  I have nothing against the herky-jerky documentary look of filmmaking, but, when you do it in a slasher film, you're constantly giving the audience the impression that you're seeing things from the perspective of the killer.  When that ain't the case, you're confusing the story!  And to complicate matters further, the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch.  Literally!  Guy goes into the abandoned school, and it's bright daylight; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later, and it's the dark of night.  Really?  Plus, as long as I'm piling it on, do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only?  I mean, maybe that's the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned, after all.  The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film's credit, it ends.  However, the way it ends, makes absolutely no sense, and I (seriously) laughed for about five minutes.  I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut, his crew took him seriously.  Stay tuned after the credits, though, because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs?RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight, Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in association with Vigilante Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should - not a bad thing, just nothing all that special.  A few sequences were poorly miked, but, when you're making schlock-horror on a budget, you take what you get.  The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind-the-scenes materials, if you're inclined to check `em out.  Again, nothing special, but it's nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale; it's just too bad it wasn't in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you're a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh.  It isn't that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made.  To the contrary, the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way.  It's just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense.  It's as if writer/director Reynolds had an idea - one based on a regular diet of slash and gore - and then he ran with it.  And why not?  Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit, if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review."
B008POAZVC I'm usually critical of american horror. There are no suprises here regarding the usual formulas but the screaming bimbo in it wasn't a bad actress. It had a boogie man in it and the mad chase through the cornfield,which is the spring bit I suppose .I liked the second plot that overlapped the more surreal initial plot; it brought the mundane world in that was an interesting contrast for both plots.It must have had a good director despite being a cookie-cutter film. There are many horror devotees who would enjoy it,  I'd think."
B008POAZVC A young woman, who is the daughter of a wealthy family is abducted by a group of kidnappers. They all hide in an abandoned school in the woods. The group of kidnappers begin to split up as guilt takes over, and the intense drama begins as the original plan becomes a risk of getting caught. Scary, edge-of-your-seat tension and suspense. The viewer is taken on a roller-coaster-ride through thrills and chills. Haunting, creepy, Acting Performance Good. Recommended for horror and thriller lovers!"
B008POAZVC I'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller \"Rites of Spring.\" As a low budget shocker, it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers. But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story. If not always successful, it was something that I'd never really seen before. So I'll give writer/director Padraig Reynolds points for originality. \"Rites of Spring\" is really two different films. One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story. Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own, but it's the mash-up that keeps things interesting. My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars. My heart, however, is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers. And I like that! I didn't love \"Rites of Spring\" and probably wouldn't view it a second time, but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide!The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community. Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation. The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice. But for what? And is there any chance of escape? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom. Of course, not all goes as planned. There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group. Before the evening is through, they'll have to determine just who is playing whom. But wouldn't you know it? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up. So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror. As the body count escalates, it becomes a battle for survival. Will anyone endure until dawn?My biggest complaint about \"Rites of Spring\" has to do with a lack of genuine plot development. Nothing really makes much sense in the telling. Neither story, as written and presented, would be satisfying on its own and that's a near fatal misstep. The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme. Meanwhile, the horror story gets the vaguest (and most over-used) of explanations. Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios, but each one feels a bit lazy (especially if taken alone). Trust me, aside from the mash-up angle, you've seen it all before and you've seen it better. At a brief 81 minutes, however, it is just nutty enough to hold your attention. About 2 1/2 stars. As I said, I'd have been happy enough watching this for free, but it's not something that I'd recommend as a blind purchase. KGHarris, 11/12."
B008POAZVC If you are on the hunt for a new thrilling and suspenceful horror flick, then IFC Midnight's latest release, Rites Of Spring, is the one for you. Written and directed by Padraig Reynolds, Rites Of Spring brings the thriller and horror genres together in perfect harmony. This film delivers on all cylinders with an exciting story line, a believable cast and tons-o-gore.While two stories are being intercut during this film, one being more of a thriller and the other a straight-up horror piece, Rites Of Spring delivers a perfect marrige between the two. With a creepy old farmer preying on young women in one, and a kidnapping that doesn't go as planned in the parallel tale, a great deal of mystery plays out in both.The cast found within this film are all lesser known/unknown actors who obviously have a passion for film. Anessa Ramsey delivers a spine-tingling performance as the character Rachel and after this film, she is destined to be called upon for many more horror roles in the future. From her line delivery to her trembling hands, Ramsey's screen presence is remarkable to say the least.As the film progresses, the blood begins to spill more and more. There are a few effects, that looked to be done with After Effects, that can be done without, b
B008QTTGGG I find Grimm to be fun and entertaining.  Love all of the characters, they are funky and lovable.  The wesen are not all that fun, but it is a detective show, after all and there are good people too."
B008QTTGGG Loved this one. Monroe goes all out for the holiday. I wish he lived near me. I loved the &#34;woman in white&#34; aka La Llorona. Great action and great adventure. Love Monroe borrowing a piece of Nick's Grimm gear for his Halloween set up."
B008QTTGGG I love the story-arc and the individual episode writing. Very smart.The actors are superb and characters like Monroe and the Ice Beaver are quite endearing.I must say I'm a bit disappointed with the CGI. It could be better. It's good enough but it lacks distinction-it's about 80s to 90s feeI I would say. The makeup effects are nice, a tiny bit low budget, but good enough. I think they need to do more of that in the show. Hire the winners from Face Off and you'll have a stellar makeup artist team."
B008QTTGGG The new intro is like a bad version of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer intro about being \"the chosen one.\" Other than that, the new season is STELLAR. I'm afraid I'll have a heart attack with every show. It's scary, it's awesome. You love the characters: Nick! Munroe! And Hank is going to be a revelation this season. The Juliet storyline (seriously, is her name supposed to point to star-crossed lovers?) is heart-breaking because Nick is such a lovable (and kick ass) character. This season, you can see that Nick OWNS being a Grimm like he never has before. It's amazing how he can balance being this clean-cut, good guy hero and at the same time be so fierce in battle."
B008QTTGGG This is another show with an interesting premise and likable characters, but they overuse the whole animal head thing and the cutesy German language stuff. Seriously, a werewolf is a werewolf. It's not a bad show per se, and I really like the police captain character and his story arc, but I have trouble getting past the goofy transformations all the time."
B008QTTGGG I was as little worried during the episode the glory people, (i got bored and shut out off) but since I loved this show, I gave it another chance (mostly for the character of Monroe. He's the real star). I was happy I did!"
B008QTTGGG This episode is awesome because Nick finally tells Hank that he's a Grimm.  This show just keeps getting better, and it was great from the start!"
B008QTTGGG The season isn't as formulaic as one would suppose.Basic Concept, the main guy is a \"Grimm\", which means that he and his ancestors somehow gained the ability to \"see\" people who aren't quite people, but only when they get upset (they take on animalish aspects when upset, elsewise they look fairly normal).Each episode seemingly brings you another animal type, according to the background the whole thing is based on the stories by the brother's Brimm (Hence the name), and season one had it's take on Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, etc.NOTHING like the original material in so far as plot,  think more using the story concept as a jumping off point, twisting it for our times and putting it in Portland or the immediate area.Tends towards a bloody resolution, some obligatory dead bodies, that sort of thing.Entertaining, but would get boring if not for the back story of the other characters.Wife gets mystically whacked by a witch and loses her memory (Season is spent pretty much getting that back and realizing she still loves Grimm.  A bit drawn out, but the ideas and way it was handled was a nice diversion from what you'd expect).The Grimm's at one point worked for a royal family in Europe, but no more, and of course they have a secret key that when stacked with another 6 keys leads to a super secret something.  A bit contrived, particularly the structure of the keys, but a ....  wait for it...  KEY plot device in moving the background story forward.There's also some comedy and romance in the thing as well.I subscribed to the series, don't regret it, but then again, seldom find myself wanting to go back and review a lot of the episodes."
B008QTTGGG There is way too much of an emphasis on Juliette's woes this season. If she were at least a mimimally competent actress it might work, but she's limited to one -- count 'em, one -- facial expression, and that's it. Furthermore, her face screams COSMETIC SURGERY and she looks fake. Her nose is too pinched, her lips are over-botoxed, her hairline is receding, she has an overbite for Christ's sake, and her arms are fat and doughy. It's impossible to take her seriously or care what happens to her. Nick and the rest of the crew make the show worthwhile. They ought to get rid of Juliette."
B008QTTGGG I thoroughly enjoyed this series, in fact I would go as far as to say that it was better.The characters are very well cast and realised. The episodes are interesting and clever.If you like fantasy, don't miss this series."
B008QTTGGG One of the best shows I've seen in YEARS - while i've only watched 3 shows into 2nd season ... holding my bated breath for season 3.  Please don't tell me those dufus creative hollywood types are going to cancel this show or hire writers who don't have time for thought provoking action .  This show has absolutely got to be the best, most fun i've seen in a very long time !"
B008QTTGGG That My Favorite TV SERIE  On Every Week On Friday Night. I All Ways Recorded On DVD Player. I Never Get Tire To Watching."
B008QTTGGG I love this show.I hope it goes on for 8 seasons and I will be buying each season on amazon."
B008QTTGGG Hubby can't stand scarey programs but I watch on my tv and enjoy the program  slight comedy and all the program offers in solving cases. Makes me think folks are like that without the facial changes...deep down inside!"
B008QTTGGG Grimm has the most individual characters, including monsters of any night time series.  Some darn good frights, as well as humor."
B008QTTGGG Great series ... Never a dull moment...if you last off the wall scarey tales it's great....based on Grimm fairy tales...love it...."
B008QTTGGG Both the wife and I love the show and are anxiously awaiting the beginning of s3 which is only a month off.Amazon's presentation of the show is gorgeous. The video and audio are both 5 star quality. If you like Fantasy stories, you cant go wrong here."
B008QTTGGG My husband and I like it a lot we are not to much into fictional type of shows but this particular program we enjoy. We both make it our special time in the evenings to sit and watch a few epksodes to see what is happening next."
B008QTTGGG This series is an attention holder and requires some thought to follow what is going on. It is loosely based on Grimm fairy tale characters."
B008QTTGGG It took me awhile to get into this show, but once I finished season 1, season 2 was so much better. It is an original show definitely worth watching."
B008QTTGGG What are the best shows I've seen a very long time I have about six shows that I watch I think they all pretty great and ice think they should stay on the air and you guys should keep them on prime"
B008QTTGGG I watched Grimm Season 1, and got interested in it enough to keep watching.  During Season 2, I think the show's writers are really starting to hit their stride.  I thoroughly enjoyed this season of Grimm, and cannot wait to see the next season!"
B008QTTGGG I think Grimm is a great show.  I like the concept, characters, and how they put it all together (props to all the people behind the camera).  Are there holes in the idea, absolutely.  Do you want to fill them, yes.  Do you want more, yes.  :)  But, I don't worry about that.  I just enjoy."
B008QTTGGG The first few episodes of season 1 left me rather underwhelmed, tho it is an interesting idea. Now this show just keeps getting better. All the cast is excellent; my favorite right now is Sasha Roiz. Adelind's pregnancy is a nice twist. I'm hooked."
B008QTTGGG This show is fun to watch if you like supernatural things. Demons, ghosts, and what they call them is vesin which is part human and part animal. Some are good and some are bad... I like the way they bring in the good vesin helping the grimm and also how the grimm helps the good ones. He isn't out to kill everyone just the ones who are bad."
B008QTTGGG I would recommend this show to anyone who likes super natural themes.  The Grimm is worth the watch hope to see it continue"
B008QTTGGG kept u waiting to see what was happening next enjoyed the dif stories with everyone envolved will continue to watch"
B008QTTGGG Of course you always know the outcome but they have great ways of getting there. I do recommend this for others."
B008QTTGGG The intro to the first episodes was the extremely cheesy and annoying, but that was soon fixed by other producers. The second season keeps being consistent with the format of the show."
B008QTTGGG This is still a good series, not as good as season 1 though. It seems more of a drama now :-(Still very entertaining."
B008QTTGGG Most of the episodes are a bit more imaginative, but what's really better is the storyline with the royals and the girl losing her memory. I thought the volcano episode kind of was lame though."
B008QTTGGG I like this series because it sparks my imagination.  We like in the reality of the day to day grind, to be able to come home and watch this is a treat.  The characters are terrific and I love Monroe!  Enjoy!"
B008QTTGGG The Grimm program is awesome! My daughter and I have been glued to it right from the start! Great actors and the special affects are amazing!"
B008QTTGGG I'm still enjoying this fantasy cop show.  The characters are well-written, well-acted and I'm rooting for all of them.  However, somewhere we left planet earth.  I know Portland is eclectic but is everyone vessen?  Oh well, still very entertaining."
B008QTTGGG This is the show my husband likes.  It seems very interesting. I hope to see it on the air for some time!"
B008QTTGGG I liked it, but a lot of times I fell asleep while my boyfriend kept watching.  It is still good and we like it but not as excited as the season 1 episodes. We are looking forward to the new season on tv, but just not as into it.  We did shout out a lot at the tv to Grimm's girlfriend and their whole situation."
B008QTTGGG This show puts a spin on the everyday living in Portland, Oregon.  If you live in the Portland area, you will get a kick out of seeing things that &#34;happened&#34; in your own back yard.  If you like fairy tales, you will find this interesting.  As most fairy tales do not have a happy ending, neither do these stories."
B008QTTGGG we love the Grimm series, love all the actors and stories. We were both raised in Portland and love seeing all the places we grew up in and trying to figure out just where they are in different scenes. We live in Central Oregon now so fun to see sites in Portland, but we do enjoy the show."
B008QTTGGG I love this show!  Season Two is only making me love it more.  The story lines and the dialogue are a perfect combination of quirky and smart.  It reminds me of....let me think.....Joss Whedon.  Now if we could tear him away from 'The Avengers' movie franchise, we'd have a hit that even NBC would be frightened to cancel."
B008QTTGGG I have been binge watching these episodes and have begun to enjoy this show. I'm sure at some point we have all imagined someone that looks like something other than who  or what they truly are. I know I have. So it's not not of a stretch for me to accept this premis."
B008QTTGGG If you enjoy good writing and plots that go beyond the \"monster killer\" surface ads, this is a good series with a lot of depth and great secondary characters."
B008QTTGGG Our hero, Nick, with the help of Monroe (a reformed wesen) & briefly Nick's mother, is growing into his family's line of reasponsibility as a Grimm.  Hank, his police partner, is freaking out because he doesn't know what to make of what he has seen.  Juliette, his lover and friend, was attacked by an angry, vengeful wesen and after being in a coma for three days, remembers everyone around her except Nick.  The captain is able to hide his wesen side, perhaps due to being a royal.  This is a wonderful show, at times side-spitting and at others terrifying.  These are the \"true\" stories written by the Brothers Grimm.  I strongly encourage those of you who love this genre, as well as those who might, to watch Fridays on NBC 8PM central, and 9PM East and West Coast time.  Amazon also provides you the joy of owning last year and this year for reasonable prices.  WATCH and fall in love."
B008QTTGGG The excellent \"Grimm: Season Two\" is proof that \"Grimm: Season One\" was no fluke.  It continues to successfully mix a police procedural with monsters conjured up from the Grimm Brothers fairy tales, delivered with a more or less straight face in the City of Portland, Oregon.  This season, Detective Nick Burckhardt (David Giuntoli) faces bigger and badder monsters, and a widening conspiracy of evil that was only hinted at in Season One.  Fortunately, Nick has stepped up his fighting skills, and he has a lot more help this season.Nick's secret role as an avenging Grimm is now known to his police partner Hank Griffin (Roger Hornsby), joining a team that includes Nick's friend (and werewolf) Monroe (an excellent Silas Weir Mitchell) and Monroe's girlfriend Rosalee, an alchemist.  In addition, a long missing Grimm relative will surface in Portland, to complicate his life while saving it.  However, the biggest change this season may be Nick's evolving relationship with his police superior, Captain Renard, whose role in the hidden conspiracy becomes a little more visible, and whose role in awakening Nick's spellbound fianc&eacute;e Juliette becomes a complication.  At stake are some precious artifacts sought by mysterious outsiders, some of whom may be Captain Renard's friends.Each week, the show seems to generate new monsters and new plot complications.  Check out Season Two to find out what happens in a world where nothing and nobody is quite as they seem; highly recommended."
B008QTTGGG After watching season 1 I couldn't wait for season 2 to become available on DVD (I don't have cable or satellite).  I think I liked season 2 even better than season 1. However, there were several episodes where they got a little too gross and too graphic (on the violence), which I honestly don't think is necessary. (For some reason the media never understands less is more.)  But despite that, this is an excellent show. Definitely not your typical cop show.I liked how more people now know that Nick is a Grimm. Although I thoroughly enjoy all the characters, I especially like Monroe and Bud. They also bring some comic relief. Lots of suspense and some good laughs mixed in. The show is well written and very well done. This DVD set has English subtitles for the hearing impaired, and several extras.  Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD! (too bad I'll have to wait another year)"
B008QTTGGG Grimm continues to entertain and keep my interest in the characters and story lines.  Season 1 was great and Season 2 is as well!"
B008QTTGGG Trying too hard and the good stories suffered.  Resolution if Julliett takes the whole season. Good but not as good as Season 1. Relies too much on romantic twists."
B008QTTGGG Have to limit ourselves to one episode a day..........love it too much!!!!!!!!!!More seasons PLEASE!!!!  It just gets better - all the time."
B008QTTGGG I enjoy the Grimm series. Being able to view this series as a Prime member is a terrific benefit of my membership.- The characters and the story line are expanded and offer good fun.Highly Recommended"
B008QTTGGG I really enjoy the twist the writers create for the fairy tales. The actors are just right. Silas (Monroe) is hilarious and David (Nick) is very sincere, both wonderful."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is a great show. It has good well developed characters, the plots, for those that accept and enjoy the premise, is engaging drama with a generous supply of tongue in cheek humor."
B008QTTGGG The second season is even better than the first. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I hope season three is as good as the first two."
B008QTTGGG I became instantly hooked, it is unique and full of fresh new characters. I don't ever get enough of this show."
B008QTTGGG The main story is still the same and a bit repetitive but the side stories including character development is growing.  The series is worth watching and season 3 will probably be good as well. Maybe a 4 star with broadening the concept into the more of the 'non-main' but regular characters."
B008QTTGGG This show it's just  keeps  getting  better  and better  with each  season. I loved  the first one, but the second one  is better."
B008QTTGGG This season sees Nick becoming more comfortable with his role as a Grimm, and despite the somewhat annoying subplot of Juliette's memory loss, this \"creature of the week\" show adds some depth by expanding on the larger story arcs. For fans of the seminal cult TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this season of Grimm offers some pleasant parallels (Warning: Spoilers Ahead). Finally Nick is able to \"come out\" as a Grimm, which is the monumental breakthrough for season 2. It is heartwarming to see that Nick now has a \"Scooby gang\" as Buffy did; no longer must he face the world alone, with only Monroe by his side (as was usually the case in season 1). In his quests to save Portland, Nick is now able to harness the energy, knowledge, and skills of his Wesen and human friends. I look forward to seeing in season 3 how Juliette comes to terms with Nick's inherited duty; being a veterinarian, I can see her taking on a real interest in Wesen. The season leaves us with a cliffhanger, but this is not unusual for good television. The show still fails to achieve five stars because it basically remains mindless entertainment, lacking the existential philosophy of shows like Buffy and BSG."
B008QTTGGG I really enjoyed the characters and interactions in the story.  The story line is compelling and covers the private lives of the characters as well as good writing on the hunting of the Vessen.  The cliffhanger at the end of this season truly will keep you wanting to know what happens."
B008QTTGGG the first 2 episodes i saw of this in season one i thought were stupid. then i don't know what happened but it liked it. now i love it and can't wait for it to start again. some shows start strong then get dumb. this one went the other way."
B008QTTGGG Really really good, I can't wait to see Season 3 and more. Great sleuth type of story, the hunting is not that bad either."
B008QTTGGG Love the creative story line! Very entertaining. The only thing I don't like is that it can be a little gory."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is a show that you don't want to miss an episode.  Amazon shows it without commercials.That makes it flow better."
B008QTTGGG Now here is a fantasy story line that gives the viewer some credit for understanding the plots. Each segment carries its ownmain plot with background building to the next a
B008QTTGGG Just loved to watch the series from the beginning of season 1 and can't stop watching until I see the conclusion."
B008QTTGGG Season two is great. I hate the opening credits, seems kind of cheesy to me. The shows are great though and the mysteries they are trying to solve are always exciting."
B008QTTGGG I love this show!!  It is a unique and exciting way to present a police procedural.  The storytelling is fascinating and the characters are both written and acted well.  My only negative comment concerns the Juliette character.  Last season I found her to be annoying but this season she truly ticks me off.  Her character is supposed to be intelligent, but she does and says some pretty stupid things - case in point:  during her meeting with Adalind, she tells her all sorts of things about the trailer NIck's aunt left him before she died, where it is, etc.  If some woman that I barely knew showed up out of the blue and started asking me questions about my estranged boyfriend, I certainly wouldn't sit there and answer them, especially without asking why she wanted to know.  Frankly, I believe that this show would be just as good, maybe even better, without Juliette.The mystery surrounding the Royal Families, why they want the key, and what the supposed missing treasure is has me completely hooked!  I can't wait for more of the mythology to be revealed.  I would definitely recommend this show but be warned that some of the death scenes can be graphic."
B008QTTGGG Season Two picks up with nary a heartbeat missed.  New Wesen are introduced as well as the subplot continuing.Monroe finds himself a friend, Hank gets closer and closer to understanding and the Captain, once thought to be villain, becomes a viable ally.The character development is far deeper, acting more easy feeling and stories... well, the stories range from evil to devious to an occasional, unexpected laugh.  We've grown to really love this series.Stay Weird, Portland.  Stay Weird."
B008QTTGGG I have watched(and will continue to watch)all the great horror shows.(tru-blood,supernatural,vampire diaries)Grimm is in a class of its own.Great acting,a superb story line,and plenty of suspense!If there is not a season 3I think you will have an uprising on your hands!"
B008QTTGGG Grimm is fantastic fun, a romp in pure imagination. The writing is great, the sense of humor wonderful, the monsters hilarious and sometimes scary. The second year is as good as or better than the first. Some have criticized it for the intro and the Juliette business. After the first two three episodes, however, the intro is cut to almost nothing, and the Juliette narrative, though normally boring, is crucial to tying the storyline and characters together. Have fun!"
B008QTTGGG Never seen grim before until amazon offered on the stream service. looked into it and its a great series.  Amazon is on its way up with its streaming services, quality is great. Look out netflix"
B008QTTGGG It's sort of german mythical/fable mixed in with modern life mixed in superstition. Pure entertainment value and that's about it."
B008QTTGGG Overall the story and progression have moved exceptionally well. Some parts I did not care for b
B008QTTGGG Grimm's first season set up an interesting world.  Season 2 took that world and went into crazy relationship stories.  It takes the entire season for Nick to fix his relationship with his girlfriend.  Monroe hooks up with the store shop owner.  Everyone knows about Nick being a Grimm.  Like &#34;Buffy,&#34; and &#34;Angel&#34; the TV show is now about a group of people helping the super powered detective solve crimes committed by the supernatural.  Everyone in the group has their own &#34;relationship&#34; nonsense going on including love triangles.  Meanwhile t
B008QTTGGG Great CastI like the basis for the story linesthe make-up for the creatures is fantastic and the change-overs is seamlessI love creepy storiesThe ending was REALLY a SHOCKERCan't wait for the next season"
B008QTTGGG The storyline is well thought out. I do not like &#34;ugly&#34; because I think in pictures and these things re-run in my mind. However, I watched all the episodes."
B008QTTGGG Grimm has great personalities and terrific storylines.  The outlying Portland area really is shown to best advantage in these episodes.  Hope this one continues forever!"
B008QTTGGG After how Grimm ended, I knew this would be an intriguing season. I knew nothing, for this season would prove that this had people running a story, not simply another crime procedural or supernatural crime thriller. Not only are there more crimes that are a juxtaposition of Grimm fairy tales and real-life types of crime, there's another story arc taking over, one dealing with a monstrous conspiracy that could shame Interpol's wanted list and real-life conspiracy theorists if it were real. Good thing it isn't,it's only inspired by real historical dealings of the same sort.In the end, it delves further with a couple new people finding out about the Wessen and a zombie outbreak, with end card titlesthat show the showrunners have a good sense of metahumor."
B008QTTGGG Great show.  I really enjoy it.  I watch with my gf.  Can't wait for season 3 to hit prime so we can watch it."
B008QTTGGG Solid storyline . Had a long break but now back picked back up where it left off. Defentley recomend watching . Enjoy"
B008QTTGGG Seems to be an unending supply of monsters to fight and some interesting twists to some of the stories, so I find this series entertaining."
B008QTTGGG Highly recommend this series. I was skeptical, but once I started watching them...I was hooked. Has some scary parts, so I wouldn't have small children watching it, probably 12 and above. Great acting and story lines."
B008QTTGGG I am not a huge pure fantasy fan.  That being said, the mixture of human relationships and a taste of the supernatural is wonderfully refreshing"
B008QTTGGG As the first season. I love the the show. It's so different and not the run of the mill shows"
B008QTTGGG The second season is just as good as the first. Everything still clicks, the plots , the cast, the creativity is spot on!! My interest has not waned. I hope for many seasons of this great fantasy."
B008QTTGGG It is my favorite.  I hate the thought of watching them all at once, so I have been trying desperately to ration them out, but they are awesome.  Great mixture of comedy, drama, and thriller.  I always want to watch the next episode.  By far my favorite TV  show right now."
B008QTTGGG it is good, but the &#34;Juliet-no memory of Nick&#34; plot line lingers too long and the Capt Renard reveal & Juliet accepting of Wesen plots are settled too quickly. Again, it is the secondary characters; Monroe, Rosalee, & Bud (also Sgt Wu) - who really give the show heart and fun. I am glad it got a Season 3, hopefully the can either focus on the arching storyline or monster of the week plots, because that format will quickly get old (see X-files,et al). I like to see they go into the other characters, mainly the wesen friends to see how they deal with the day to day, keeping their society a secret, and interplay between different wesen communities."
B008QTTGGG I discovered Grimm by accident, and I love this show!  While we know Wesen aren't real (they aren't, are they?), this show blends the Grimm stories in such a way that they are totally believable. I like the quotes at the beginning of each show that give viewers a hint of what is to come. I hope that I can find Season 3 streaming somewhere when I finish watching Season 2."
B008QTTGGG Awesome! Love this series, although, I think they're bringing too many people into the 'fold'?! I also like the wi-fi connection viewing - good stuff!"
B008QTTGGG This was a great find: inspires stories, likable and believable characters, sweet tension and astounding special effects.  Thanks for a Grimm experience!"
B008QTTGGG Much enjoyed season 1. And season 2 did NOT disappoint, giving me more &#34;wesen&#34;. Watching season 3 now. If you have not seen season 1, start there. You will NOT be disappointed!!"
B008QTTGGG Episode is a new character. You can see in each character how their life style and personality fits. It teaches you how to guard your temperament and act responsible."
B008QTTGGG I like this show because it is different.  I also like to see all the different creature faces that are created for this show.  The actors are good and mostly attractive.  This is a show that takes a person out of their present time, escape into another place and way of life.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and interesting plots."
B008QTTGGG I like Grimm. It is a very interesting concept and a quality series. I have to say that I do not like the CGI effects, but the series is so cool it bothers me less and less. I think a mix of mostly practical effects with CGI enhancements would be perfect.The best part of the series is that it was already very good and original and is improving as it goes along. Season two already stands out. So many series crumble as they progress that I am very happy to see this one getting better. I hope it goes on for a very long time (as long as they keep the quality up)."
B008QTTGGG Love the Show, would have given 5 stars, but the video was a bit choppy.Hope this stays on for a while."
B008QTTGGG Great show, loved the stories when I was young, Good actors really enjoy it. Find myself wanting to keep watching."
B008QTTGGG I really like this blending of the world of fairytales and real life.  When you think that fairytales and mythological stories were people's way if explaining their world, it's just another way of fitting them in.  I like the escape from reality."
B008QTTGGG My husband and I are addicted to this show! It is our guilty pleasure after long days at work. A hint of the X Files in the story lines but more fantasy world rather than scary or alien. You become emotionally attached to the characters and end up feeling like you're rooting for them. Highly recommend! Good for guys and girls but maybe not for younger kids as some of the scenes may look scary. Definitely a good one for twenty somethings."
B008QTTGGG I love the intrigue and mystery coupled with the fairytale aspect of this show. This is a great show with one of those story lines that will make you waiting and longing for the next show."
B008QTTGGG It takes a second time for me to catch the link between the story and the quote from the Grimm Fairy Tale.  As with the first, it is enjoyable to watch.  Some of the characters might be a bit intense for the younger people, while characters such as Roselee and Bud offer nothing to be frighten of and would make great stuffed animals.  What I find interesting is that Nick's aunt and mother did not distinguish been Wesen that are evil and those that look to lead a normal life.  Whereas Nick sees the difference and excepts them as equals.  This should make for some interesting future shows."
B008QTTGGG I have really fallen in love with Grimm.  It's been a lot of fun!  I'd love a tiny bit more of the magical aspect to it, but not a lot more.. I don't like shows that go WAY over board with the magical, mystical weird stuff..  This is a good combination of Crime Fighting, Cop investigating, a bit of Magical Story book type of stuff that pulls you in.  I like the characters, they are all pretty kewl and I really enjoy their roles in the show.  Pretty darned fun to watch!  I love it!"
B008QTTGGG This storyline is getting on my nerves! What is taking so long for her to remember Nick? I really don't like Juliette anyway so having her character with anybody but Nick is stupid! I say keep her with Nick, accepting his gift, and becoming a doctor to the so called inner beast people. Now that would be perfect! If something don't happen soon I am going to have to start watch once upon a time! LOL"
B008QTTGGG Grimm takes a new perspective on fairytales.  Actually, if you ever read the original Grimm Brothers, this may be more truth than fiction.  (Just kidding)  But, the mixture of policeman + Grimm works well.  I love the transformation of people into the fable characters.  The weekly episodes are stand alone, yet there is a deeper story line throughout the seasons.  This makes it good if you are just trying it out.  This makes it great if you are an avid follower.  I love the idea and the delivery.  Good job!"
B008QTTGGG Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is back as the butt kicking Grimm/mother of Grimm/detective Nick Burckhardt, and she is sorely needed in the first two episodes of the new season. Nick is up against one of the most terrifying villains he has ever faced - the Mauvais Dentes. This creature has saber-like teeth that can rip you apart. While Nick gets reacquainted with his mother, Monroe and Rosalee work on an antidote for the poison infecting Juliette. Right now the poison is removing Juilette's memories  - starting with Nick. In a great twist at the end of this episode, it ends on a cliffhanger with the Mauvais Dentes after Nick. Fantastic start to the new season."
B008QTTGGG I love Grimm.  I really miss it when the season is over and wish it was on all the time"
B008QTTGGG TV show is very interesting to watch as that makes me tempt to watch more episodes. I hope there is another season 3 coming up soon..."
B008QTTGGG I love the characters, but I would like to see a deeper side of Michael.  I love the animal friends.  It is far fetched but lets face it, you have to be a fan of fantasy/sci fi to watch it.  I was happy that Michael's boss is on his side (I think)....  Looking forward to season 3"
B008QTTGGG My husband really loves this show.I usually don't watch horror or the sci-fi genre of tv show.But this one is different for some reason.Don't know why,but I find myself watching it with my husband and actually being interested.Good work."
B008QTTGGG My favorite show on TV right now. Glad I was able to view via Amazon Prime on a next day basis as I don't have live TV."
B008QTTGGG It's wonderful to see new writing imagined with great new actors and their characters.  I love this show and look forward to each new episode."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is a fun show on a lot of levels but I particularly enjoy that it is filmed around the Portland, Oregon area (where I happen to live and work).  I love the humor and light horror aspects--not into gory details.  The characters are all strong and the stories are fresh.  Hope to see the new season on Amazon Prime soon!  Keep up the good work, Grimm producers!"
B008QTTGGG The premise is terrific.  Who thinks up this stuff??.  Execution is fabulous--scripts, cast, sets, lightin, makeup,  everything is well done."
B008QTTGGG What is not to like about this show.  It has romance, monsters and Grimm's.  You get to see what we read about in our youth come alive on TV  and DVD."
B008QTTGGG The story is fleshing out more and the characters getting more believable as well. I am quite enjoying this series."
B008QTTGGG i really enjoyed this series. i hope it continues. the actors are very entertaining. one used to be on prison break."
B008QTTGGG Good acting, good series, one of the better shows out there, totally worth watching. Fun stuff. Grimm with a twist."
B008QTTGGG This series is a good one with the potential to be great. With individual characters that lend toward a Buffy feel to the show in some ways, it definitely stands on its own and is still unique. I felt this season to be a vast improvement on the first, my only complaint is that allowing other characters like Hank to grow within the world while leaving Juliette behind feels contrived, like it's been done (a lot) before and holds the show back in that the writers had to keep backtracking to include her story. That said I would still recommend this show and I'm looking forward to season 3."
B008QTTGGG Novel premise, well acted good story lines. Can be addictive! Highly recommended. This is a series that definitely grows on you."
B008QTTGGG They do a good job of suspending belief. If you have ever been to Portland ( and I was there for 10 years) they picked a great location for the story."
B008QTTGGG I started watching Grimm on Amazon because visiting family were watching the current season.  I found it very entertaining. The acting is great, and it is based in Portland.  If you like fantasies and fairy tale characters, this one's for you."
B008QTTGGG I love this show, and the quality of the video is great - even on my iPad v1.Comcast is so expensive, and I like so few shows, that it's worth it to get apass for the series and wait one day to see each episode."
B008QTTGGG I love this show, and Monroe is one of my favorite characters so I enjoy any episode in which he appears for a good bit of the show.  My only problem with this one is Juliette.  It seems like they can't decide what to do with her.  I wish they would hurry up and solve her memory loss, as it doesn't seem to add to the story line."
B008QTTGGG The rating should be 4 1/2 really. It is a good, solid show with interesting characters, AND it's getting better, something that can't be said of most series. The grounding in the Grimm fairy tales is wonderful."
B008QTTGGG The show continues to be worthwhile in the second season.  I think the Juliette plotline is a stale trope and should have been cut short.  I think the characters and their development, outside of Nick and Juliette who stagnate the whole season, continue to be strong.  Still a decent show in a sea of mediocrity."
B008QTTGGG However, it is a great series. Well written, great characters, not corny, but watch with an open mind.I am watching season two, that says it all."
B008QTTGGG Didn't think I would like this show but saw one episode in the middle of a season and it looked interesting enough. Once I started watching it from Season 1 I fell in love! Keeps you wanting more."
B008QTTGGG Another fine episode in this hit shows second season.  The show remains a outstanding horror fest with strong characters and good effects. This episode features another good story line about the vesson and their various actions. I haven't seen a bad episode yet of this one and this has beat the odds because most horror shows fail on tv."
B008QTTGGG STILL KEEPS THE VEIWER GUESSING AND THE SUB-PLOTS BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND JULIETTE, AND THE CAPTAIN AND NICK ECT ARE REAL GOOD KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND I'LL TUNE IN"
B008QTTGGG The progression of this show has been good.  From discovering who/what he is to the point he is at now has been a great journey and it has happened the way I wanted it to.  I knew from the beginning that the great tension they set up would have to be addressed and I've been waiting for it... and now it's here.  He has even begun to discover new &#34;abilities&#34; that I had wished for right along.  This is a show that feels like it is moving toward a purpose.The acting is good and the interactions have become progressively better and enjoyable.Good show.  Give it a shot."
B008QTTGGG The battles and plot lines have gotten better. The acting is good.It is a very enjoyable show.So glad they got rid of that story announcer half way through the season! It was stupid."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is an awesome series and I can't wait for season three to start this Friday! This has taken the old fairy tales and combined them with police action to create an awesome storyline with well developed characters. I just wish Mr. Grimm (David Giuntoli) would have dumped his girlfriend last season and replaced her with ME! LOL He is truly hot hot hot and really makes the series not only great but also very easy on the eyes."
B008QTTGGG I decided to finally check this show out during the weekend the first season became available on Amazon Prime. WOW! I immediately bought and downloaded the second season because it was so fantastic. If you're a Buffy fan, you will LOVE this show. Many of the elements are very similar, which shouldn't be surprising because I think the creator of this show is a former Buffy writer. However it doesn't feel like a retread. It feels fresh and fun. When this show debuted, another fairy-tale inspired show also bowed. I felt like I could only devote time to one of them, and for some reason I was drawn to the other based on early descriptions. I made a big mistake. Grimm blows that other fairy-tale show out of the water. I'm almost done with this season, but I don't want it to end."
B008QTTGGG I have been a fan since the beginning premiere.  It's interesting to see the key players develop and the &#34;beasts&#34; they come up with are creative.  Recommended it if you like dark fairy based stories."
B008QTTGGG I like this sorta wacky syfy type program a lil different but entertaining I thought I would just watch a episode but end up watching the whole series"
B008QTTGGG I recently found out about this tv show Grimm, and instantly was hooked. It put's a whole new spin on the fairy tales we grew up with. The acting is impeccable, and I find myself seriously looking forward to season three and what happens next. I am really excited that the captain and nick are finally working on the same side. This episode was eerie in the way Juliet's floors became a black whole. The directors really think out side of the box. I whole heartedly give the whole season 1 and season 2 5 stars. A must watch."
B008QTTGGG Love this show!!!!!!!  Just enough reality to make it easy to suspend disbelief.  Great. Acting love special effects and fantasy aspect!!!"
B008QTTGGG Good television!  This is an imaginative show with a solid, likable cast.  A great use of old story book tales!"
B008QTTGGG I always worry when shows have an ongoing, complex backstory going. Often it means that the episode flow takes a back seat to the backstory. Not in this episode I'm pleased to say. The story here is a child abduction by a parent. Only we all know it is never that simple don't we? Of course we do. Things move along in clear steps, no clues that make you feel like you've missed something. The backstory is running smoothly alongside the case, not overwhelming it at all. Hank is more at ease with his knew knowledge, he is coping, no longer looks like he is losing his mind.I enjoyed the episode, it all came together nicely, and we met more helpful Wessen, instead of ones needing to be killed. Also a good thing about recent episodes. Not all Wessen are looking for Nick to kill them. More and more have principles and use them. The viewer can see how Wessen fit in and hide in plain sight. They even sneak in a little sympathy for the dad who has lost his job on top of the personal stresses he's been dealing with. Dad wants nothing more than to take care of his family but is at the end of his rope. Disaster looms. Cue Nick and Hank to the rescue. A simple story, straightforward, and I liked it."
B008QTTGGG Love it!! The price was great and the DVD set is a &#34;must have&#34; for any fan of the Grimm series.  Originally a gift, decided to keep for myself - Definitely recommend!"
B008QTTGGG I really enjoyed season 1 of Grimm and Season 2 is better yet!  Love the characters.  One of my favorite &#34;new&#34; shows."
B008QTTGGG have not reviewed season  2 am only in season 1 3rd episode and am enjoying it very much at this time."
B008QTTGGG I don't really like gory horror so had my doubts about this show. After watching season 1 I was left with the need to see what was going to happen next to the goofball detective (who seems a little soft). Hollywood as it seems today is making men soft and very stupid with relationship with the opposite sex that it is taking away from what few good shows not reality on tv. In my opinion this show is worth viewing if you enjoy a tinge of horror and sci-fy."
B008QTTGGG Entertaining fantasy.  I grew up in a German American town and enjoy comparing some of the characters to some memories of my childhood.  Of course things were not nearly as exciting back then as the adventures in the story!  To some extent, to appreciate such fantasy one must be willing to engage a willing suspension of disbelief.  Being able to follow the story lines in sequence, without interruption, the way Prime streaming allows is wonderful."
B008QTTGGG Great show, something different and with great twists in the story line.  Can't wait for season 3 to come on!"
B008QTTGGG I really enjoy watching Grimm to see the people &#34;change&#34; (not familiar enough with what they call it in Grimm vessing or voging)  LOVE the main characters, except Juliette.  The storyline about her getting her memory back took way too long and I got bored with it.  I don't like her character.  And now they're taking their relationship slow since her memory has returned.  I think they should have just gone back to the way they were originally.  Maybe I'll like her character more when I see how she'll be with all of the new knowledge she has about Nick and what he does as a Grimm."
B008QTTGGG I really warmed up to the show in the second season.  The first season was full of exposition that got a bit hard totake in at times.  Now that the show is setup it is much more fun.  The scripts had more of a flow and theCharacters were established."
B008QTTGGG This is a well written show.  All the characters are very good no matter what circumstances they go through.  Every episode is full of entertainment."
B008QTTGGG when fairytales require policework...this show just keeps getting better. the ensemble cast really makes this show fun as the story lines gel especially well and the show hits its stride as it discovers its own identity..."
B008QTTGGG The Grimm writers keep you on your toes wondering what will happen next. Love triangles, spells, curses and potions. Alliances change ... one week your cheering and the next week booing a central character ... you've got to watch every episode so you don't miss anything. Oh, and make sure you've got Season 3 ready to go, because the season finale cliff-hanger will drive you crazy until you know how it turns out!"
B008QTTGGG Can't Wait to see Season three.  What a great show, it's well acted, well thought out scripts and well just continues along on a high threshold of quality. My wife and I love to watch this show together. We prefer DVD's to television so wait to buy the DVD's then watch the whole season in one shot. This is one show we can hardly wait to see the next season. There are some amazing surprises that are natural progressions for the show to take in this season setting up what I hope is a season 3 that is just as great as the first two. If you like story's about the things that go bump in the twilight this is a great show for you.Ralph J. Fitcher"
B008QTTGGG I love this show!  It just keeps getting better and better every episode.  The new twists this season were crazy.  New alliances between sworn enemies, bad guys fighting other bad guys, and a hexen beast that just won't quit all lead to great action and bizarre story lines.  Can't wait to see season 3."
B008QTTGGG So far I am not half-way through season two but it is good so far.  Lots of gore though and the bodies do stack up.  Seems to be a sort of Grim(m) sense of morality and justice played out in Portland, Oregon. Being Portland, you wonder how they found that many dry days to film it."
B008QTTGGG This is one of my favorite programs.  I like the relationships between the various main characters.  The story lines are interesting.  It's sort of a combination of a cop show and supernatural.  The Grimm is a homicide detective who traditionally kills 'vessins' which are creatures that live in the midst of us (humans) and appear as human, except to another vessin or Grimm.  But this Grimm has vessin friends but terrifies bad vessins.  To fully appreciate the show you only need to watch one episode.  I don't think I missed any episode since it began and between seasons I watch reruns."
B008QTTGGG A unique show. I love the characters. I find it hard to stop at one or two shows at a sitting. A great fantasy!"
B008QTTGGG Love this show!  Good cast of characters.  If you like shows with a bit of supernatural beings you will like this show.  A 'grimm' is a man with the ability to see beyond the human facade that creatures hide behind.  The main character-Detective Berkhart works for the  Portland, Oregon police department.  He encounters this creatures when investigating crimes around the Portland area.  Good supporting cast.  Good story lines.  Highly recommended."
B008QTTGGG The wife and enjoy this show in our regular viewing. It's not too over the top, but it's different enough to keep us sci-fi/fantasy folks interested. It can get a little gory at times, but there's no gratuitous foul language or sex."
B008QTTGGG Very good Television Series. The graphics get better as the show progresses.  I am ready for more Grimm Season 3."
B008QTTGGG The first season of this entertaining series introduced us to the various cast and their histories and agendas the second season gives us more on both the creatures of the Grimm Stories and the shadowy agenda that lurks in the background.  If you've seen Supernatural then this is another series to add to the collection as while there are obviously major differences with the stories and characters both are at the end exciting and entertaining to watch."
B008QTTGGG I'm a big fan of this show. Since I live in the NW & it take place in the NW. I don't know what else to tell you about the show but that it is a great show."
B008QTTGGG This has become one of my favorite shows since there are so few quality programs out there now. I'm glad that Nick is finally brining Nick into his realm of being a Grimm as well as Juliette."
B008QTTGGG I have viewed since day one, with the help of commercials before it was on. Has went beyond all expectations and more. I am hooked."
B008QTTGGG I like the Grimm series. it is very well done. The stories are exciting and fun stuff. However, Amazon doesn't yet have season 3 for free."
B008QTTGGG Liked it, started season 3, I figured why not, by 3 they should have the kinks worked out and a smoking plot. I get Grimm, and all of the foul creatures who try to destroy him."
B008QTTGGG Nothing particularly outstanding about this program in terms of acting or story lines, but it sure is fun to watch.  Great special effects and totally different from any TV shows that are available.  New and different."
B008QTTGGG The stories in season2 continue to be riveting, interesting, and just plain entertaining. The characters remain interesting with great development and interaction with each other. I would highly recommend the Grimm series."
B008QTTGGG It is an interesting take on why people should not visit Portland OR. According to the weekly series: there's a monster around every tree! Overall I like the show, but would hope season #3 would be the last as we all need closure in this."
B008QTTGGG It took me a few episodes, but now I am hooked. A few more episodes to go in season 2. Looking forward to find out what happens with the Prince. I have an idea but need confirmation."
B008QTTGGG I really like the series. The writing is still really good. I would recommend Grimm to anyone who is a fan of shows like Once Upon a Time. The show is one of my favorites."
B008QTTGGG I'm really starting to love this show. I just wish they would stop coming up with more and creepier Wesen and instead have more stories involving the ones from the first season. I liked how the first season had Detective Burkhardt solving crimes with his Grimm powers. The second season doesn't really have much of that, it's all about the Royals and the Resistance and the underlying conflict."
B008QTTGGG Season 2 is just as good as season 1. Still full of action and fun moments! Same great characters! Interesting storylines! Huge cliffhanger on last one!! Love it! Anxious to be able to watch season 3 when it comes available for free!"
B008QTTGGG I'm awaiting this TV series Grimm S-2 so I cannot review something I have not received. Sorry but show me later after I get the series two."
B008QTTGGG I do love this show and look forward to each episode..  I also enjoy all the characters with one exception and that is the character of Juliette.  She is boring and I do wish she was off the show.  I don't believe in the romance between her and Nick."
B008QTTGGG Grimm season 2 is just as good if not better than season 1.  The show picks right up were last season left off, and it is at a dead sprint.  Very good stories and acting.  A must watch."
B008QTTGGG I have seen season 1, and I actually saw season 2 when it was on TV, but I watched this again with Amazon streaming.  I just love this show and am anxiously awaiting season 3.  The special effects are what makes this show and they are so well done.  Nick's partner, Hank, had to be told what was going on, and it was a truly funny episode.  The person playing Monroe usually plays a heavy on TV, but he is so likable, and you're pulling for him to get his love interest going.  If you have never watched Grimm, you are missing the best show on TV.  Start with the very first episode in season 1 and go from there.  You won't be able to stop watching."
B008QTTGGG This series is really cool, great special effects, entertaining story line, and quite on the money, I actually know some of these creatures, I work with two of them.  But I can't say anything more, they do read these reveiws too you know."
B008QTTGGG People kept telling me to watch Grimm since I'm big on comic books and science fiction. I recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of fantasy. You will not be disappointed. You warm up to the characters too, A lot of humor to it as well."
B008QTTGGG THIS SERIES IS A GREAT SPIN ON THE FAIRY TALES I GREW UP WITH!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW...FOUR STARS FOR CREATIVITY!"
B008QTTGGG Every week something new. Without giving spoilers, new &#34;creatures&#34;, royal family intrigue, plots and sub-plots, humor and the ever present quest for what the heck is going on about that &#34;key&#34;. A must see series."
B008QTTGGG I really enjoy all of the subplots probably better than the larger story arc.  The characters are well developed and carry the story forward very well."
B008QTTGGG Reminds me of the old Night Stalker series of a long long time ago. Everything about it just CLICKS into place as fun and good. The humor of this series is great. I hope it stays on for a few more seasons."
B008QTTGGG We really enjoy this series.  A little different than the norm.  Kind of reminds me of Buffy. We watched all of Season 1 and when Season 2 was available, we watched it over Thanksgiving weekend. We really enjoy watching series this way. No commercials and don't have to wait a whole week for the next episode. A real cliffhanger for Season 3. We'll probably wait for it to come out on Amazon, also."
B008QTTGGG But the main reason to watch Season 2 is to see how nimbly the show balances humor and jump-out-of-your-chair scares. Even better was the work of the ensemble cast, as everyone stepped up their game."
B008QTTGGG It follows the idea of the Grimm Tales. Its fun to watch and keeps you interested in characters. I think its worth watching."
B008QTTGGG Season 2 of Grimm was very interesting, to say the least!!! You have the Grimm, Nick, growing in his role as the Grimm.  He is showing his human side and his Grimm side and sometimes those two sides clash!  It is fun to watch and see all the different people involved in his life finding out how much they need him and, how much they can trust him!!  It is a great show to watch and enjoy!!"
B008QTTGGG I tried watching this earlier, but disliked the 'monster per week' focus. It got significantly better, and now I am hooked-the continuing stories that developed the characters really made this worth watching, as well as a somewhat darker edge, mixed with comedic moments."
B008QTTGGG The stories are imaginative, entertaining and educational. My biggest challenge is trying to keep up with the different names of creatures."
B008QTTGGG Great entertainment, writing and acting are top notch, This show is very smart. It's funny, dramatic, The characters are engaging. The episodes just get better and better as more of each character's back-story comes out."
B008QTTGGG My husband enjoyed it more than I did.  But, I found it entertaining and will probably watch more episodes in the future."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is pretty entertaining.  It can be predictable but it is pretty good. The violence is too scary for pre-teen children."
B008QTTGGG The acting is very good, the special effect excellent, and the stories very well written. There's a continuing theme running through this series, so we get revelations here and there, which I enjoy. Each episode has a story complete in itself too. The stars are lots of fun, especially the lead, Nick, and the Monroe characters, the latter being a lovable, vegetarian werewolf who has decided he must resist the urge to kill. Both of the stars' live-in girlfriends are really good characters too. It's a fun show that has, at least to date, kept the quality high and the action fast-moving. I rate it as one of my two favorite series, the other being &#34;Sleepy Hollow.&#34;"
B008QTTGGG I just love this show, it is unique and well scripted.  I love the stable relationship between Nick and Juliette is wonderful.  Also the support group Nick has developed is interesting.  This isn't a show about a loner who &#34;gets things done&#34; but a human being connecting and making a difference in a complicated world."
B008QTTGGG I can't say enough good things about this series!  It's witty, funny, fast-paced, has story lines, excellent and memorable characters., and terrific dialogue!  Its an addictive ride through the Grimm's fairy tales through the lense of a crime drama set in Portland."
B008QTTGGG A bit far fetched, but very well performed. The acting is top notch. The special effects are over the top."
B008QTTGGG This is a very well done show. The pace is so well scripted and hope we see season 3 soon."
B008QTTGGG This show just gets better and better, the stories are wonderful, Monroe is one of the best characters in any show, I love the horror, the humour and the surprises."
B008QTTGGG If the emphasis would be more on the critters and their intrigues and less on his flawed relationship with insipid girlfriend, the show would be 5 stars.  Very creative beasts and the contest between good-evil & new world order all great fun.  Amazing cinematography, special effects. Worth watching for a bed time story."
B008QTTGGG great series - Fun & entertaining - Just the right amount of adult theme makes the series a must watch"
B008QTTGGG I stumbled across Grimm through amazon prime instant video.  I started watching Season 1 episode 1 and before I knew it I was through Season 2.  It has some gory parts so be aware in case this bothers you."
B008QTTGGG Great series great cast. Always something new each week and now with the Grimm book of vessen and weapons it makes it even more interesting.  A Must Have Series."
B008QTTGGG PURCHASED THE FIRST SEASON OF GRIMM BECAUSE I LOVED WATCHING IT ON TV AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION. SO OF COURSE, COMES THE SECOND SEASON TO MY COLLECTION."
B008QTTGGG I do like the story line and the video quality is off the chain, I want more of the Grimm"
B008QTTGGG I've really enjoyed this show. It has a great story line and is different from most shows out there. I love the characters. I hope they put all of the seasons on prime"
B008QTTGGG Grimm is a good old fashioned set of fairy tales for adults. It is simply fun. You will enjoy Grimm."
B008QTTGGG This show is extremely well done as an adult horror series and I am never disappointed when I watch.  Great casting, great acting, great photography, and great story line.Ted"
B008QTTGGG I really enjoy this show, especially Monroe. He makes me really want to believe in Blutbads (good vegetarian/green-minded Blutbads like him, of course). The show has just enough chills and thrills to keep me tuning in every week."
B008QTTGGG Grimm is very entertaining to those of us who still have an ability to live in our minds and then return to the mundane real world."
B008QTTGGG Nick is a much improved Grimm in season 2, he is giving it more punishment in the fight scenes instead of taking it."
B008QTTGGG The connection from season 1 to the opening of season 2 was fantastic and filled with anticipation. Really enjoy this show and the suspense building in season 2 is great... still watching it."
B008QTTGGG On the front of the box it shows the main character \"Nick\" swinging an axe but it never happens in the show.  There is no axe.  It's just a cheap marketing ploy.I wanted this show to be good but it is not. I saw season one and was bored and hoped it would get better but it never did.  Being a \"Grimm\" means you are related to the faerie tale author from long ago.  The only thing that separates a \"Grimm\" from a normal dude in the show is that they can see a wolf/ox/fly/lamb person and that's it.  Strangely this seems to terrify creatures that can shape shift, heal, jump ten feet in the air and have claws and teeth.  It makes no sense.  It's stupid.It makes no sense that the Grimms have not been all killed off by now.  They have a power that is problematic for beast people but not dangerous.  If you just look at the world like it is Grimms are no big deal but everyone seems to think they are because of the writing that has no basis on logic at all.(spoilers)OK well the whole Juliet amnesia thing gets dragged out more which is really really really boring.  Nick continues to act really wooden,  The partner who is a better actor does not get less air time than last season.  The Asian dude is still the plucky comic relief comic relief which is racist.  All the monsters are white people which is racist and their is a Mexican Banshee which is odd.The monsters are not all were farm animals this season which is better but actually less tied to actual Grimm faerie tales or legends of any kind.  I have no idea why the show is called Grimm.  I imagine there is a copy of Grimm's Faerie Tales in the studio but I'll bet it is dusty.There was a Minotaur (Greek) that turns into an Efreeti (Indian) but is played by an American white dude like 99% of every monster on the show, I mentioned the Mexican (Mexican/Spanish) Banshee (Irish), Naga (South Asian) biker dudes played by more American white dudes. Actually all the monsters are basically played by white people from America or Canada which makes no sense what so ever.None of the plot arks ever unfold into anything interesting.  This show is so boring and not connected to Grimm's Faerie tales at all. It should be called \"Were Farm Animals and Cops that Deal With Them\""
B008QTTGGG The show was well done it has a lot of Original ideas for fairytales. Special-effects are done so flawlessly that it's really difficult to even see them. This series get you away from the humdrum and it's very entertaining. Well-written well acted you can't go wrong."
B008QTTGGG I love this show. The characters and the acting are very believable. The special effects are incredible. If you like the fantasy genre you will love this show."
B008QTTGGG I love this show. The writers are keeping the story line going and I enjoy the team work in the show. My Daughter watched an episode with me one day and now is ahead of me in the number of shows watched."
B008QTTGGG This show is unlike anything I've ever watched on TV before!If you like cop shows, & supernatural mystery, then I think you'll really enjoy this series. But, Grimm isn't just any cop show!When I had watched the trailer, I really didn't know how producers were going to be able to pull off; mixing a bunch of Grimm Fairy Tale stories in with 2 cops & make it actually work. All I can say is: Not only does it work. It works incredibly well. The costumes, along with the artists who do the make up for the actors & actresses, do a phenomenal job!At the end of each episode, you're left with the feeling of not wanting it to end & wishing there was more! I like to imagine just what fairy tale monster they'll come up with next & what it'll do or look like in the following weeks to come.Oh. And, Nick is pretty easy on the eyes, too. Just sayin'. ;-)"
B008QTTGGG Love this show. I cant seem to get enough of it. I hope they never cancel it. Keeps me interested and wanting to watch the next episode one after another."
B008QTTGGG Loved season 1 and couldn't wait to continue on with season 2.  It didn't disapoint. I recommend this series to any syfy watchers out there!!"
B008QTTGGG Love watching this show. Great characters - Nick is good, but Monroe is better. Loved Nick's mom - more please! You won't waste your time here."
B008QTTGGG This series is fun to watch. It does not take itself too seriously. It is not swarmy, melodramatic,or too much &#34;hollywood&#34;The actors seem to have fun and not forced to be the 20 something drama-queens you see these days in many sumilar series."
B008QTTGGG Great show.  Season two is a little more dark than the first year.  But I still enjoyed watching it and seeing the great make-up."
B008QTTGGG We really enjoyed this. It keeps your attention. we just couldn't wait to watch the next episode to see what adventures awaited Nick, and the team. It's the kind of show that has you laughing your head off one minute to sitting on the edge of your seat in suspense the next. It's funny, scary and very entertaining.  a wide variety of themes and characters which provoke all the emotions making and excellent series. It's a must see with no regrets."
B008QTTGGG If you like fantasy/SciFi/etc, \"Grimm\" is a fun show to watch. It flows well, the characters are likeable (except for the bad guys of course) and the computer generated stuff is fairly well done.The show keeps a good underlying theme with reoccurring characters and plots all while adding new characters and subplots on a weekly basis. That means, the writers are doing a pretty good job of holding it together with all the twists and turns. \"Once Upon A Time\" does a much better job in this area but \"Grimm\" is no slouch.Overall, I would call the series mediocre family friendly. There is violence, sexual situations, body parts here and there with killing, So, this fairytale is more on the adult side.It's a really good show and fun to watch. Really. Season two gets 4 stars.For more detail, visit the comment section."
B008QTTGGG Awesome show, and Nick really gets his footing as a Grimm in season 2. More action packed and darker than the first season, but still preserves it's humor."
B008QTTGGG Seems to have a lot of great content to show with each episode but the writers probably don't need to add any more new Wesson - expand in the ones already presented."
B008QTTGGG The second season of this fantasy show is continuing to show the same great writing, great acting, and attention to detail that made the first season so much fun to watch. The individual episodes stand on their own as entertaining stories and the long arc of the series is developing well. I look forward to the next season with anticipation."
B008QTTGGG I really like where they've taken the series. A few episodes can be a little hokey b
B008QTTGGG The characters speak to me in a way I didn't expect. Following their story and the way the themes are developed making this very pleasant entertainment."
B008QTTGGG Learned tove a  blubaut and all the other clever critter -people created for this series. The writing is well done and the major characters balance the crash-bang of the villains with genuine sweetness and relatedness. I loved the story lines in each episode. Great fun! Can't wait for the next season!"
B008R6LI0U Did they just stop updating this series? there are way more episodes to this season than are available here on Amazon."
B008R6LI0U I was pleasantly surprised when I went to re-watch the second season, there were so many new episodes! I think this is the best Scooby-Doo series and it is seriously sad that it is not longer than 2 seasons. I can & have re-watched this series several times already and forsee that I will continue to re-watch. Great series!! Worth buyong if like Scooby-Doo at all"
B008R6LI0U I prefer the &#34;real&#34; monster Scooby, but my 8 year old daughter enjoys this version. I kind of roll my eyes at all the homage's (I am old enough to have seen the original scooby when I was 11 or so) but appreciate their inclusion.I honestly only took a star away because of that title screen up there, with Scooby on Shaggys back...seriously? It gives off major homo vibes, lol."
B008R6LI0U This is NOT the Scooby Doo you remember from your childhood.This series of programs is NOT suitable for very young children.This series is written for an older audience than the traditional Cartoons.  There are actual scary villains in some of the episodes - not just misguided townspeople wearing goofy rubber masks.  There is also significant more violence in the earlier efforts.Think of this more as an \"graphic novel\"  which features some of your favorite characters from childhood. The animation is significantly better than the Hanna Barbera efforts.  It looks spectacular in HD.  The writing quality is also considerably better than the earlier efforts.  After some 40 years, the central characters are finally being given a backstory.All in all, I was very pleased with this current effort."
B008R6LI0U And that's probably what is more important I suppose.  It's not quite the same Scooby-Doo that I watched growing up in the 60's and 70's.  But again, it entertains my kids."
B008R6LI0U Saw the first season and was hoping for a second, finally to see a second was amazing and with an actual plot to it. I am hooked."
B008R6LI0U I love the series and the characters, I just wish it also came as a DVD and not where atleast have the episodes are only accesible through instant vidio.  While this can work, it would be great to be able to have disk so I am not tied to having to sit at my desk on the computor to be able to watch the episodes.  I enjoyed having an ongoing plot that is combined with the individual episode plots lines."
B008R6LI0U What can I say, I grew up in the 80's and Scooby Doo has always been a great show for the kids and adults alike.  It's funny to see them use technology and to see Fred actually pursue Daphne.  It's nice also new to see a natural timeline and progression of relationships among the characters.  My kids love it, let's hope they continue to develop additional seasons."
B008RUCX3M Joe Garner is a nice guy, somebody you wouldn't mind hanging out with because he is, well, a nice guy. The hanging out wouldn't be wild crazy fun, just a nice good time. Craigslist Joe is a nice film, something reasonably nice to watch, nicely filmed, nicely edited, nicely done. Joe appears to be a kind non-judgmental person.At its core, Craigslist Joe is a road movie. The premise Joe Garner wants to spend 30 days living off Craigslist ads only. He's chosen the holidays, December 1 to December 31. At first I wondered if he would just hang out in LA and develop a life off those connections. Instead, the goal was really to do a lap of the United States. For a while I kept thinking about the problems with what he was doing, looking for the flaw in his goal and how he was going to accomplish things. Like why did he borrow a bike from somebody in LA and then take it with him to his next stop. Why the bike, how would he return it to the kind person, where would he leave it? This is fruitless reasoning in the film; it is much better to just take the ride with Joe.This film violates the road movie convention. There are always at least two people on the road. Where are John Candy and Steve Martin? Where were the Griswolds? What happened to Zack Galifianakis (well he is here, but more on that in a moment), Ed Helms, and Bradley Cooper? Shoot where is Thelma and Louise? No this film is all about Joe, one guy on the road. This is the huge flaw in the film, where it falls flat from a dramatic standpoint. There is no tension or drama built with traveling partners. There isn't much of a story built. At the end of the film, I had this empty feeling.On the one hand I loved this film. Joe is such a nice guy. He sets out on a 60's type journey, hitchhike the modern way, using the Internet. I'm sure Joe has incredible memories of his trip. The people along the way can be fantastic in the moment. Conversations all seem so deep. He did the take a summer off and backpack Europe into an American journey. All such a great concept. I hitchhiked across France and I can see how true his experience rang. I really loved the editing and visual language they used in the film. Given the hours and hours of footage they had to choose from, they did a great job piecing this together. I loved the maps and animations when he moved from one city to another. I also really liked the computer postings at the bottom of the screen, they added to the story. The film is a bit long at an hour and thirty minutes. I did find myself looking at how much time was left fairly often.Joe meets a number of tools during this trip. Because he wants to remain friends with these people, he is never judgmental; he leaves that up to the audience. Number one tool was Mr. Suit and Tie on his first stop. It wasn't a great start for the film. On the other hand, he did meet some amazing, nice, friendly, interesting people. Again, because he doesn't judge (verbally or with editing), the viewer can make up his or her own mind. The premise is also kind of strange. We get to hear a lot of the phone calls and what should be the first conversations. At some point I kept thinking, when did Joe mention that he was making a documentary? It is very difficult to imagine that part of the conversation or what Joe would say.Joe: Can I crash at your place / ride with you / help you volunteer somewhere?Person on the phone: Oh maybe.Joe: That's great, I'm making a documentary about using Craigslist to freeload my way around the country. We'd film you and your place.I can imagine the answer going either way. But in the end, it isn't the same thing as just asking somebody if you can help, crash, or ride. There's extra baggage. Joe needed to embrace that and break the fourth wall. He certainly breaks it with his direct confessions into the camera talking to us the viewer.One of the last meetings is really bad. It falls way flat and just sounds stupid in the film. Mentioning the person would be a bad spoiler.There was something that felt wrong about this movie. It was almost too slick, too well produced. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I read the credits. Zach Galifianakis was the producer of this film. It isn't clear he was involved before or after the 30 days on the road, but his influence is abundantly clear in the film. This film was not somebody outside of the Hollywood machine (Garner was a producer on Hangover II prior to this film), but a person that does have Hollywood experience. Documentaries tend to be made by people on the margin or outside of Hollywood. The editing of this film was particularly good; most documentaries are more hacked together. Drew Kilcoin was the editor - he has some decent movies under his belt (granted as first assistant editor), Flight, Beginners, and Texas Chainsaw 3D. Joe Garner managed to find some pretty talented people to help with his film post filming.A good resume is not usually a bad thing, except it takes a lot of shine off something that is a personal project with a simple premise. The production of the film removed it from that simple world.On the other hand, Kevin Flint, the cinematographer is a genius. He did an incredible job on this film. His camera work is excellent under the horrible conditions he had to work in. I would guess the film was all shot handheld, and he did a really good job. Kevin does not appear to be part of the Hollywood machine. It would be interesting to see a little bit of how Kevin kept up on the trip.A bit of parental advice on the audience for this film. The film is not rated. There are a few moments of strong language. There is no nudity, violence, or bloodshed. There are a number of scenes in bars and alcohol use. In theory this could be a PG film. Joe managed to completely avoid the sexual side of this trip. It is kind of hard to imagine nothing happened for a month that he never hooked up with anybody on the road, male or female. He pushes the PG envelope a lot during a visit with a dominatrix in Chicago. There is never any nudity, but the discussion is frank. Oddly Joe is completely asexual. The film is probably best left for a more mature audience.Overall this is not a bad film. It isn't exactly one of the best documentaries around. I dislike the gloss that was added to the film and I am automatically cynical about the Hollywood connection to this film. I think documentary should be independent film, done outside of that industry. I wish there was more of a story and there was a second person on this road trip. On the other hand, Joe is such a nice guy."
B008RUCX3M Joe starts out on a journey across america with just a cell phone and a camera man, and in the process meets with charicters both quirky and generous.In a time where some people are begining to feel that life has gone sour, Joe, through his travels shows that the generousity of the human spirit is alive and well in america.A feel good movie well worth a view."
B008RUCX3M This interesting and enjoyable story is the journey that twenty-nine year old Joseph Garner takes during a time in America when the country's economy and sense of community has begun to crumble. Joseph, who is a film-maker decides to venture out to discover on his own if America has in fact lost the sense of community during tough economic times. He leaves everything behind to see if he could survive off the goodwill of America's new town square, Craigslist. He needs to discover if America has changed, and if it's now every man for himself, which at one time was not. Even though America is known to be wealthy, has the economy changed the community? Joseph also cuts himself off from everyone he knows, prior to embarking on this adventure. He decides to live off Craigslist, the new town square, for 31 days and nights. He will have no transportation, food, shelter, or companionship. He depends solely on the generosity of people. Acting Performance Excellent and Entertaining throughout. Highly Recommended!"
B008RUCX3M Quite charming except from a completely different era than I could relate to.  In the '6os we did it minus lap top/cell phone or even craigslist.  Our wanderings never went as flawlessly, but we still encountered kindness & had a lot more fun than Joe.  Kerouac did it best in the '50s.  The beatnik of all time wrote a book - not a silly semi-documentary movie.  Am having trouble adjusting to this current world..."
B008RUCX3M I am not a big documentary film fan, but I took a change on Craigslist Joe and boy am I glad I did.  By far one of the more inspiring, honest and emotional movies I have ever seen.  It was shot during the 2008 economic crisis and it uncovered how truly good people are...it was amazing to see and I would recommend that everyone add this to their must watch movie rental list!"
B008S9CU7G I loved this movie. I rented it on Amazon on Demand and thought it was better then the Rec2. Note I liked Rec2 allot. I dont want to spoil this movie. So, if you are a Rec fan go ahead and rent it. I am really looking foward the eventual DVD release. But I believe it might be awhile, so I went ahead and spent the $9.99. I have a feeling the US theatrical release will only be in VERY limited theaters such as the Angelica chain; which is only in very large cities. Sadly, I dont live in Dallas now, so I rented it instead. I have a gut feeling we are looking at a Spring 2013 DVD release at the best."
B008S9CU7G Clara and Koldo will never forget their special wedding day, especially after a deadly contagion transforms their wedding guests into a pack of flesh-eating monsters! [&#9679;REC] 3 kicks things off with the same familiar format, using a variety of vantage points that are being filmed from several hand-held devices. As soon as the wedding is crashed, however, there is an immediate shift in style to a more traditional form of filmmaking that comes as quite a shock. This allows series creator Paco Plaza more freedom as he packs tons of black humor and outrageous gore into this blood-soaked sequel. Where [&#9679;REC] placed its aims on realistic shocks and terror, [&#9679;REC] 3 owes much more to the works of Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson when it comes to splatter. Instead of tossing a bouquet, Clara spends her wedding night hacking up guests and lopping off heads with her trusty chainsaw. Leticia Dolera and Diego Mart&iacute;n make an entertaining pair, as both are able to play up the comedy as well as the horror in equal measure. In addition to the subtle ques that are dropped throughout the opening, we also catch background glimpses of news footage that as it is being recorded from the quarantined building across town, intricately linking this to the two previous films. While the jarring difference in tone may surprise fans, [&#9679;REC] 3 is entirely enjoyable in its own right, and a welcome addition to the series.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
B008S9CU7G \"[REC] Genesis\" at least deserves some credit for how many types of camera perspectives it utilizes in its short 80-minute duration. It begins with a slideshow of Clara (Leticia Dolera) and Koldo's (Diego Martin) wedding; complete with star wipes and every other wipe you can think of. Then it jumps into the handheld perspective you've come to expect from this franchise. About twenty minutes later, that camera breaks and a more cinematic perspective is used throughout the rest of the film. In between that though, we see security cameras and night vision. It's actually really impressive how it all comes together.You know things are going to go downhill once the uncle shows up at the wedding talking about how a dog he thought was dead woke up and bit him, but he's okay now! The first twenty minutes may seem excruciating, but it's mostly done to witness the slow deterioration of Koldo's uncle Tio (Emilio Mencheta); his behavior becoming more and more peculiar, his eyes becoming bloodshot, and eventually throwing up blood.The horror film does get really ridiculous at times. An infection breaks out at a wedding, but why does that affect their cell phone signals? Is it because of their location? But even the landline doesn't work, so it mostly just feels like this convenient plot device thrown in to make things more messed up for the protagonists. Koldo and Clara being able to \"sense\" each other was really cheesy, as well. It's understandable to have a close bond, but their sensing abilities would have Spider-Man throwing his bag of popcorn at the screen and booing. Then there's the whole Spongejohn character, which results in the longest face palm you've ever experienced.Everything else is a lot of fun though. The make-up effects are fantastic. They seem to be the perfect blend of practical and computer generated effects. Every blood splatter, every piece of skin snapping as somebody bites it off, every decapitation, and all of the mayhem with the chainsaw. It's just glorious. The tire iron scene by the police car that goes on way too long and becomes humorous is also pretty great. The use of lighting is visually striking at times; mostly during the scene in the rain and the entire tunnel sequence. There's something about the way bright and fluorescent lighting contrasts with rain and enclosed structures that makes this infected outbreak seem that much more compelling.\"[REC] Genesis\" is fairly different from the two films that come before it and introduces a batch of nothing but new characters. It may even lose fans because of the path it chooses to take. The ending is sure to be the cherry on the polarizing sundae. But if you look at the film as a love story between Clara and Koldo first and a survival horror second, then it's a bit easier to appreciate.While it is kind of silly at times and isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, \"[REC] Genesis\" is the type of bloody mess you're almost embarrassed to show other people yet still thoroughly enjoy. It almost seems tongue in cheek at times and even has shades of \"The Return of the Living Dead\" and \"Dead Alive.\" This might be the minority opinion, but \"[REC] Genesis\" is short, fantastically bittersweet, and a hell of a lot of bloody fun."
B008S9CU7G It's a perfect mix of dark humor, irony, romance and gore. Although it's personality changes from REC 1 and REC 2, it won't won't be a disappointment. All three of the REC movies are fantastic."
B008S9CU7G This film was short, sweet and persistently effective, with some of the best blood work, tactfully sharp color-correction and beautiful filming of any zombie film.HARDLY A SEQUEL:  There are loads of negative reviews out there of this movie. It seems that all such reviews are based on inconsistencies between this and the previous two REC films-especially the zombies' behavior.  So, folks.  Just stop doing that, get over your judgmental self (not that I'm any better), treat this movie as a stand-alone zombie film and enjoy!In the first five minutes I realized that this film was accomplishing something that very few of the recent horror (or sci-fi-horror) movies managed--to present the characters and get you to like them in a manner such that, were you not told beforehand, you wouldn't know this was a horror movie until something awful happened.  Chernobyl Diaries (2012) tried, but the premise and setting was too blatant.  But Cloverfield (2008) really succeeded using the same found footage style.  For those of you who dislike found footage horror, this movie shifts to normal filming and presentation after about 20 minutes.  Until which our lead couple is very sweet, credibly humbled, and have an adorably choreographed first dance on their wedding day.After a zombie outbreak initiates with patient zero in during their wedding reception, Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Leticia Dolera) are separated and their resolve is tested.  Clara is more than just a pair of big bright eyes and innocence wrapped up in a snug wedding dress.  She turns into a credibly tough chick fighting for her future with Koldo, who I find to be sincere, but a much less effective character (than Clara) until the final scenes.While having no effect on the \"zombie movie dynamic\" that we've come to expect, REC 3 takes a Biblical approach to its zombiism complete with holy water, flecks of gospel, and occasional imagery.  Combined with the personable introductory scenes of this film, I find this to have a more welcomed and original flavor than most zombie flicks.The zombie action is quality, the gore is festive, the survivors' sense of terror and urgency feels very real, and no one has ever made a chainsaw look so damned sexy as Leticia Dolera!  This also may be the most beautifully shot zombie film I've seen since 28 Days Later (2002) and the color-corrected crispness of the blood occasionally borders on artistry.  The blood work was truly fantastic on all levels.  And the ending...GREAT.  The whole film was short, sweet and effective.  Oh, and don't worry if you haven't seen the other REC films. This is a solid stand-alone sequel.If you see one zombie movie this decade, make this it!REMAKE SIDEBAR  Paco Plaza wrote and directed all three REC films (2007, 2009, 2012) and wrote both remake Quarantine films (2008, 2011).  While Quarantine 2 was less of a remake, I'm left to wonder if there won't be a Quarantine 3 to complement REC 3.  Normally I'm all for more iterations and re-imaginings of the same movie.  However, REC 3 was so amazing I fear that no budget could possibly duplicate the perfection I witnessed...and I couldn't imagine replacing Leticia Dolera with anyone!  She was phenomenal!"
B008S9CU7G [Rec] 3: Genesis is a refreshing entry in the [Rec] series. The events in Genesis occur at the same time as the events in the the first two films- you can even see news coverage of the original film in one of the scenes. During Koldo and Clara's wedding festivities, a relative that was bitten by a dog before arriving (the dog from the original) gets sick and falls over a balcony. He bites his wife, and chaos erupts.As I previously stated, Genesis is a refreshing entry; at around the 20 mark, you'll see a title screen and be introduced to a traditional style of filming as it ditches the found-footage style. As a fan of [Rec], I was originally a little disappointed. But, there have been so many found-footage horror films since 2007 (many of them being very bad) that it was refreshing to see a great, traditional horror film. The violence in this film is taken to the next level. The first film was running and hiding, the second film had more shooting, and this film focuses more on melee combat (think: Dead Rising). This violence includes a chainsaw cutting someone vertically and heads being chopped off; it was a bit cheesy at times, but it didn't bother me too much. I did like the dark humor this film had, though. I smiled and laughed a couple of times, and with bizarre characters like SpongeJohn, it was hard not to. But it's not a complete comedy, the movie has some very serious and even sad scenes. *Very minor spoiler* There is a scene where a bunch of survivors (mostly kids, I believe) are loaded onto a bus only to be massacred and Koldo can only helplessly watch from a security monitor (remember, these are his relatives). The ending was also great, my favorite ending of the series. Overall, the acting was fantastic, especially Koldo and Clara (although she's on the cover, she wasn't used enough), the music was great and it had some beautiful shots of the \"zombie\" chaos.I highly recommend [Rec] 3: Genesis. I'm not saying to lower your expectations, but considering this film moves in a different direction, I recommend expecting something a bit different. I've got a feeling that this will be a hate it or love it film, and at $9.99, I recommend you rent with caution. Although it may not be as scary as the original, it still packs in some scares and plenty of thrills. As a fan of the series, I was completely satisfied by this entry. As a final tip, I personally didn't feel like most of the trailers did this movie justice, so I'd avoid them if possible.[Rec 3]: Genesis has very strong violence and gore (the most in the series), and some very brief \"zombie\" nudity."
B008S9CU7G so i really enjoyed this movie. ALOT. i loved the first two...i truly do believe they are groundbreaking, especially the first one.my god, what a franchise.this movie takes the first two, and in the first twenty minutes turns the whole thing on its head...a risky move, indeed.i loved every minute of it. the leading actress was/is absolutely stunning, the lead actor is just fine, and the special effects scared the jesus out of me. truly jumped alot during this movie.i completely recommend this movie but be warned...its a hardcore ride and doesnt hold back.if you liked the previous entries...you must see this."
B008S9CU7G Ok, if you expect to see a found footage horror film like the previous installments, you'll be disappointed. But I loved because of the quite breath of fresh air that this franchise took with it. It is also quite fantastic to know that this demonic possession could spread out to every part of the world and that you are not safe.Most will disagree with me but I consider this the 4th best horror movie of 2012"
B008S9CU7G REC1 - A news reporter and some firemen are quarantined inside of an apartment building where the tenants are starting to succumb to a very zombie-like infection. A horror film that was clever without drawing too much attention to its found-footage gimmick, which it used more effectively than most others.REC2 - Taking place immediately after the previous film, this movie follows a SWAT team and three teenagers (plus a few others) as they enter the apartment building to figure out what's going on. Annoying characters and inconsistencies ruined what was actually an intelligent addition to t
B008S9CU7G I seriously couldn't or didnt't know how to rate this video at first,becasue the first 20 mins sucked. After the first 20 mins this movie made a big turn around it truly came life. Rec1 and Rec2 were turly awesome I really have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the camera. It remind me to much of blairwitch project and I hated it,but over all I enjoyed this movie despite of the moving camera witch was not able to focus in the movie like it was suppose to. I would recomment this movie to watch in the end it was well worth the watch. I gave this movie 3 starts,because of the first 20mins of this movie."
B008S9CU7G I don't hate this movie, but I don't perticulary like it either. It has good points, nice characters, a good pace, tense situations and good fight scenes. However this film has many flaws that drop my opinion of it. First, this film sometimes throws in cheezy moments or humor that undermine the serious situation. Second, the fact that this movie was made after a true sequel to the original makes me feel dissapointed with it. Had this been the 2nd Rec movie made, it would've been recived better as the series would be viewed as an anthology series rather then a series with one plot and another movie thrown into it (Halloween suffered the same fate). Finally this movie never explains if it takes place before or after the others. Not revealing that detail makes it seem like this movie was just a cash grab.Ultimatly it's not crap, but I didn't enjoy it that much."
B008S9CU7G A kung fu kicking, chainsaw wielding, blood splattered bride screaming \"it's my day\" is my kind of bloody good fun. So, then why is it that the new entry in Spanish director Paco Plaza's soon to be never ending franchise fails to move me. I suppose to be honest and up front I never did really think all that much of his previous (REC) movies, nor the dull nearly shot for shot Quarantine American versions. The films have all been too deadly serious and derived of the kind of fun that makes a good scary movie. And yet, the lighter, sillier, and even reasonably more engaging (REC)3: Genesis still didn't move me.Starting off as a found footage document of the wedding of Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Letica Dolero), for the first fifteen minutes we attend the various wedding day gatherings, toasts, drunk uncles, etc., until we are ready to check that we are in deed at the correct movie and not some projectionist's lame practical joke. Finally, the drunk uncle turns out to be a zombie and through the usual bite unleashes a zombie plague. The title card arrives informing us that we are in deed in the correct theater, after all,  providing that you are still awake.For the next hour the picture moves at a breakneck pace as Clara and Koldo are forced to dawn chainsaws and medieval knight's attire, don't ask, to face down their undead relatives. At a running time of just eighty minutes, once things get rolling they do indeed, thankfully, not let up.(REC)3: Genesis takes a lighter tone that it's grim predecessors, it's full of slapstick humor and strange quirky bits, like the children's entertainer dressed as a SpongeBob knock off, spongeJohn, of course. Think a wedding and four hundred funerals. The problem is, none of it is really all that funny, the humor draws the viewer out of the narrative, often it is badly forced, occasional just plain bizarre, and very rarely hits the mark.Of late the horror genre, so beloved by me and many others, has become tiresome and stale, it`s stuck in a rut that is worst than any I have ever seen. The very fact that the (REC) movies, and possibly even the Quarantine films, are seen at the forefront of the current movement illustrates the distressing point.The stars here are appealing, mostly Spanish actors that I am not familiar with, but a good talented lot. Dolero is very good in the lead role, she's beautiful and forceful, which helps the proceedings move at a more agreeable rapidity. Enhanced by thralling camera work from Pablo Rosso, who helmed the other (REC) flicks. The screenplay, credited to Plaza and Luiso Beredjo, from what I hope was meant to be an ironic credit for original idea by Plaza, Beredjo and David Gallart, is just plain awful, derivative of not only their earlier films, but countless others, it is also chocked full of hideously stupid dialogue, then again that could just be in the subtitling. Still, Clara nd Koldo refer to one another by \"my love\" so many times in the movie's short running time that a drinking game could be suicidal. The show all comes to the same kind of close that we have learned to expect from it's predecessors.(REC)3: Genesis unfortunately adds nothing new what so ever to the genre, for sure some are going to draw comparisons with the much better Shaun of the Dead, but I think that the inspiration lies in a slightly more obscure film from the early 1990's. My feeling is that it desperately wants to be a close cousin to Peter Jackson's truly magnificent New Zealand zom-com Dead Alive, but Plaza's movie winds up being merely brain dead.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B008S9CU7G The only good thing about this film is some of the death sequences, but this one is totally different from the previous two REC films. The other two were some of the best foreign films I had seen but this one is too campy and cheesy acting by some of the performers. Skip it and just stick with the first two."
B008S9CU7G I am not sure what this feature had to do with the rest of the series. The previous infections were clearly viral while this infection seems to have something to do with fallen angels.The film opens with a wedding and the hand held camera genre. One of the film makers is a professional photographer who has a device to steady his camera. Without this device the camera jerks around making the film \"unwatchable.\" During the reception an unexplained zombie infestation breaks out as uncle swan dives from the balcony. This localized zombie infestation spreads to the wedding party and soon the bride (Leticia Dolera) and groom (Diego Mart&iacute;n) have memories for a lifetime.These zombies are semi-intelligent, semi-foot dragging, and respond to scripture spoken in Spanish. Their faces are cover with indelible blood that stays on in a heavy down pour. The film genre has moved from a suspenseful hand held film to a campy bloody zombie slasher complete with the bride toting a chainsaw. Oh the things we do for love. I guess it is what you are into. \"Rec\" fans will surly hate it while fans of campy zombie films have another one for the marathon.Parental Guide: F-bombs correctly spelled out for the kids, implied sex scene, a distant nude scene plus some weird mirror horror nudity. And of course blood, and dismembered body parts approaching Troma style."
B008S9CU7G Great movie.  Better than most of the crappy &#34;zombie&#34; flicks/TV shows that have come out since 28 Days Later.  Thanks."
B008TCF7WW This was a family favorite. It showed history usually in a family fun and educational way. Jon-Erik Hexum would probably have been a big celebrity like Cruz, Christian, and others but he made the mistake of playing with a blank pistol as they were filming the second season."
B008TCF7WW I was in middle school in 1982, so I'm kinda surprised I don't remember this show. Without the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, you may find this quite difficult to enjoy. Considering its age (30 years ago!) I wasn't expecting much during a recent viewing, but I was nonetheless mostly disappointed.PROS: Although apparently not a high-budget production, the locations and sets suggest a moderate amount of care and effort, with the unfortunate exception of occasional clips from various video media. Voyagers! would be a fine show to watch with your (young) children if you have any. History as a premise for episodic stories is of course a good idea, and it almost feels wrong to badmouth any show that ends with, \"If you want to learn more about [historical element from the episode], take a voyage down to your public library. It's all in books!\"CONS: While the two protagonists were more or less well-cast, their scripts didn't give them much to work with; the acting is basically dreadful by today's standards. I was hoping that Voyagers! would at least make me laugh occasionally: no such luck. When a TV character repeatedly exclaims \"Bat's breath!\" you are reminded that you are not watching a drama intended for a mature audience. I'm not saying that this or any show would be better with vulgar expletives instead, but the phrase \"Bat's breath!\" should give you some indication of what you are in for if you choose to watch Voyagers!I would not pay $ to view this serial. I gave it a shot due to its cost (free on Amazon Prime) coupled with my penchant for sci-fi/ fantasy. After 2 episodes I am shelving it on my list of shows to watch if [by some cruel fate] I run out of good shows to watch."
B008TCF7WW I had never heard of this series, so was delighted that I came across it on Amazon.It's now one of my favorites, and I've watched 18 out of 20 episodes. I look forward to the last two.Pity that Jon-Erik Hexum died so young."
B008TCF7WW I loved this series when it was on TV originally.  I am glad it was available on Amazon now.  My children liked it when it came out and both started looking for things in the library thanks to this show.  I wish that some station would remake the series."
B008TCF7WW I remember this series on the television. It was unique and I thought I would take a look at it and see how it holds up. This is an old series, and so much has changed with years. It brought back a lot of memories. Yes, it is a bit corny by comparison to the shows today. It is a series that is positive, and happy. No graphic violence, and you get to put historical events into a context all ages can enjoy. This kind of series does not exist anymore. It still gives a warm experience, and can be shared with the whole family. It is smart, the people treat each other with respect. It does not insult your intelligence. A unique experience indeed."
B008TCF7WW Great show for kids has a lot of history lessons mixed with entertainment it was a great show when I was a kid now as an adult its a little corny but I can watch it with my kids."
B008TCF7WW Written by people who did not do their history homework and engaged by actors with just a modicum of ability, the show takes us 400 years back in time to another country where everyone speaks English and laundromats are as plentiful as Starbucks."
B008TCF7WW I couldn't believe it when I saw this in the TV list. I had forgotten about Voyagers, but I was instantly transported (pun intended) back to childhood. I LOVED this show! And looking at it now, Phineas Boggs reminds me a lot of Capt Jack Harkness, magical mystical wristband, and all.I've added Voyagers to my watch list; I have a little boy whom I hope will get as big a kick out of the show as I did."
B008V6Q2YS great show... what a disgusting display of tv entertainment!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
B008V6Q2YS I really did not like this show at all.  I wanted to see what it was about and it really is about nothing.  I guess the money helps the family but the show is not interesting at all.  Like watching paint dry."
B008V6Q2YS My guess is TLC thought they hit the Redneck jackpot with this family and planned to exploit them for fun and profit.  They've got extreme couponing, the Redneck games, the teenage, unmarried pregnancy, obesity, toddler pageants, roadkill bbq, and a couple other negative American stereotypes thrown in for fun.  They're probably kicking themselves that they couldn't manage hoarding. (I mean TLC is more carnival side-show than learning channel anymore).  I think it backfired on them when the family didn't turn out to be a bunch of fist fighting, bitter and angry Rednecks on food stamps who were paranoid over the government. Instead they got a family that loved and supported each other.While I think the entire pageant system is a huge scam and detrimental to the self-esteem of young girls (and boys), Alana seems to think they're fun. Her family has a much healthier attitude towards her participation than most pageant parents as in, it's great if she wins but they don't punish her if she loses.  I do think they'd be better served if they directed her energy elsewhere.I'm just glad they got rid of Glitzy the pig. THAT was annoying."
B008V6Q2YS I have to admit, I was curious about this show because I keep hearing so much about it.  It didn't seem like something I would like, but my husband and I decided to give it a shot.  We watched more than half of the first episode and finally had to turn it off and put ourselves out of our misery.  This show really is by, for, and about the lowest common denominator.  The producers are exploiting poor ignorant people, who in turn are exploiting their unremarkable and untalented little girl.  Do yourself a favor and watch something that makes you feel good about life and humanity.  This only made me feel disgusted as it showcases the worst in the human race."
B008V6Q2YS I am fascinated by this show. So hokey and yet can't stop myself from watching. Keep asking are these people for real?"
B008V6Q2YS I am sitting here trying to figure out why I watch this? Oh I remember, I accidently signed up for it with one click. My bad. Live and learn. What a sad life style."
B008V6Q69Y About Cherry is a pretty sad movie, I think. Not sad in the usual way, though. It's about a girl played by Ashley Hinshaw that enters the porn business because she's looking for a successful career choice as well as a way to make some quick and easy cash. Working in porn -depending on the photo or movie shoot- can reward the actress anywhere from $500-1,000. To a young aspiring young actress, that's a LOT of money. She can't resist.  We see the part that I was most curious about- when she first walks into a porn studio and fills out the job application.  I've always had a curiosity what kind of questions they ask the girl... and as I'd feared, they're pretty blunt and direct sexual-related questions. Still, it's not enough to discourage Ashley to just walk away.  She continues on.Unfortunately the actress in this movie doesn't realize that what she's doing is widely considered inappropriate to everyone in her life. Her friends, mom, boyfriend... they all want to drill the message into her head that what she's doing is disgusting and wrong, and that when surrounded by people who care deeply about her, she shouldn't be doing it. These people appreciate Ashley for who she is but... she apparently doesn't realize it. She's so determined to become a legitimate actress plus getting a generous paycheck for participating in the sexual acts, that she doesn't seem to care what anyone else thinks. She's unaware that the people who care about her don't agree with her career decisions. The boyfriend screaming \"It's DISGUSTING!\" during one particular scene is a highlight. He says it over and over again to the young girl so intensely, that she tears up and basically freezes, unsure how to respond. There's also a pretty good amount of time devoted to Ashley and a man she meets at a part time strip club job.The good news is that Ashley definitely has a lot of emotion and cares deeply for others so if you think she spends her time in About Cherry totally clueless and being treated solely as a sex object, guess again.  However when it comes to her career, she seems to turn a blind eye to reality and progresses forward.  Maybe that's what real porn actors and actresses do when it's time to film a photo shoot, and how they've managed to make a name for themselves.  They just *do* it without feeling anything that might prevent them from going through with it.The movie sort of changes as it rolls along and focuses on one of the women that works with Ashley's character (played by Heather Graham). She's an older woman that happens to have a girlfriend of her own, and the storyline -for whatever reason- shifts to focusing on Heather and the relationship troubles she experiences with her girlfriend. I find this somewhat odd since the movie worked so hard with Ashley Hinshaw's character. Also the ending... it's bad. It basically goes against what I thought was going to happen for one thing, but even worse, it never touches upon a conclusive element pertaining to the people in Ashley's life (her mom, friends and boyfriend). We needed to know MORE. Without spoiling the ending, the scene before the credits roll just... seems completely not right.  It feels incomplete.While I agree with the other reviews that it seems odd how Ashley never even tried to search for another more respectable job, you have to remember when you're young and just graduated high school, you fall victim to how overwhelmingly confusing the world can be at that young age, so an opportunity to make easy money in a porn business doesn't seem so outrageous or far-fetched given the circumstances.  Your perception at that age is focused more on succeeding in any way possible so you can feel secure and independent, and have the power to take care of yourself."
B008V6Q69Y This is a kind of amateurish film, with very poor character development. In fact, we only really get to know the female lead. In contrast, portrayals of the mother, father, boyfriend and sister are empty and shallow. While there is some hint of incestuous abuse early on, this thread is cut off with no follow-up. As for the pornography, it consists primarily of some topless shots and what might be called \" dirty talk.\" A number attractive women are also shown kissing each other. Some males also do the same. The only bright spot in this production is the physical beauty of the female lead. The ending is kind of amorphous and the acting is sometimes hysterical--as marked by over-the-top emotional outbursts. Watching this film probably won't hurt you, but I don't believe that you'll get much it of it either. For those viewers that do happen to enjoy it, consideration might be given to the very similar movie,\"Starlet\"."
B008V6Q69Y terrible horrible movie, no fx, no good pic, no good view, nothing, bunch of good actors after get high decide to do a terrible horrible movie ...this is a low cheap budget movie...stay away..so bad, bad director, bad producer, really this is a vomit of movie..stay away..do not buy, do not rent, do not copy, bad movie"
B008V6Q69Y The movie does a fine job of taking you from movie to reality, performances in this are very subdued and in that very well played. It conveys, for the most part, the dulled hits and emotions that we experience in life, delivering no great surprises nor any true redemption for the characters, their redemption is nothing more than life goes on, for some better for some worse. The flaw, if there it can be called that, is that the film is too sympathetic toward it's main character, especially her relationship toward the neutered and permanently friend-zoned male toy she drags about with her and then ultimately verbally and emotionally castrate for daring to have feelings for her. As this is very accurate behavior for most women, I hesitate to call it a flaw, but do call the fact that the movie wants us to sympathize with her rather than him a flaw. Overall it is a bit too in love with its main character who is a narcissist out of necessity for self preservation, but a narcissist none the less."
B008V6Q69Y Outside of seeing well-proportioned Ashley Hinshaw (\"Chronicle\") in her birthday suit, there's not much to be said of this surprisingly not-very-sexy film about the porn industry.  Ms. Hinshaw is Angelina, an about to graduate 18 year old who decides not to finish high school but escape her miserable home life.  Her mother (Lili Taylor) is drunk most of the time.  Her step-dad is a hulking boozer himself who comes home looking for trouble and you just know he's not far from a molestation charge, either with Angel or her younger sister.After Angelina's rocker boyfriend (Jonny Weston) pawns her off on a buddy to in order to pose for some suggestive pictures for the internet, she decides she has enough money to escape Long Beach for San Francisco.  She drags along her best friend, Andrew (Dev Patel) and they move in together in a tight sublet with the owner (Vincent Palo) who is very gay, but to be clear, Andrew isn't.  This is one of the problems with the film.  The relationship between Angel and Andrew.  They sleep in the same bed, she usually in her undies or less.  He clearly has a thing for her but nothing happens?  Oh, they're just friends.  Puleeze.  At least make the guy gay.In any case Angelina goes for an interview with a porn studio.  Surprise, she gets the job.  Initially, just a one woman show for the internet and some stills.  Then she agrees to do some girl on girl.  And eventually boy-girl.  To Angel, now called Cherry, this is all just a job.  I'm guessing this is pretty accurate for performers in the industry.  But as you might expect, Andrew isn't keen on the idea, nor is Angel/Cherry's new boyfriend and rich social stud, Frances (James Franco).Another subplot involves one of the studio's directors, Margaret (Heather Graham), who clearly has eyes for Cherry herself.  Margaret must first shake loose from a live-in romantic relationship with her real estate agent girlfriend (Diane Farr).  Interestingly enough, Ms. Graham is no stranger to porn industry films, given her role as the always naked \"Rollergirl\" in Boogie Nights.  Here she manages to keep her clothes on but does go down on Ms. Farr's character.  When this relationship ends, we don't seem to care much.  This is a theme throughout the film.I do think the filmmakers took a weak stab at showing the business side of porn, but decided to move on to the tawdry aspects of the various pairings.  Some of the dialog in the film is ridiculous, bordering on laughable.  In spite of Cherry's cheeriness, this film is not a happy affair.Shot with HD cameras, the film looks just fine.  The resolution comes in at 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are very good, especially skin tones, which of course is very helpful in a movie like this that has plenty of skin.  Contrast and detail are excellent.  The audio is also very good with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There's not a lot going on in the surrounds, although there are some scenes in a strip club and the music resonates quite well.  Extras are limited to a trailer and a couple deleted scenes, both of which were rightfully excised."
B008V6Q69Y i expected more from this movie i guess especially james franco from all the stuff i heard about him and all but no him playing a lawyer who should have been an artist and having a drug problem it was okay."
B008V6Q69Y I FELT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS VERY POORLY WRITTEN AND EXECUTED. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALL EYE CANDY AND NO SUBSTANCE."
B008V6Q69Y did not enjoy this movie. it was not what i expected it to be. maybe next time i will ask for information about it."
B008V6Q69Y found About Cherry while surfing through On Demand. I'll turn a movie off after ten minutes if it sucks, but I watched this through to the very ending, which was beautiful in its simplicity."
B008V6Q8G0 I love this show! Very real and Very scary. Not to be taken lightly for sure. I know if I viewed this as a kid and even after I would be very scared.  If you like paranormal shows I vote this one in the top 2...I guess top 1 right now for me."
B008V6Q8G0 This is a terrific series on the syfy network! It's put together really well. I've seen all the seasons and it's a great reality tv show."
B008V6Q8G0 If you love a good ghost story this is for you!  Lots of great stories of real people experiencing the paranormal!"
B008V6Q8G0 This is a great series! If you are into ghosts or ghost stories you will love it. Even a skeptic may enjoy this once they hear the stories. They do a great job on reenactments & make sure you keep that &#34;spooked&#34; feeling. I don't scare easy....but I will admit there were a few times I made somebody else go get my laundry out of the washer.....in the basement lol. My daughter asks &#34;how do you even know they are telling the truth?&#34;. My reply is simple....&#34;watch a few&#34;."
B008V6Q8G0 I am not usually scared by watching Ghost Story documentaries, etc.  I believe in God and that the devil does exist, but these stories have a way of enforcing your own personal beliefs that one step farther into the reality that ghosts and haunting's exist and are in fact more common than I think most people could ever dream.  Just watching these 20 or less (true) stories, it makes you wonder how many thousands or perhaps hundreds of thousands have these encounters and NEVER document or get help or tell others about it, they either just leave the haunted local or get help discreetly.These stories are scary and I wouldn't recommend them to be watched by young children.  I remember how easily I scared as a kid and that was before they were able to make such convincing apparitions to enhance the documentary.  You be the judge, but I have to say these two seasons are as scary as they get from all I have seen so far in any other documentary.Thanks for reading my review. BOOOOOO!"
B008V6Q8G0 I watched it w/my 14 yr old son, who couldn't sleep after watching it, even though he's addicted to it. That tells me its doing what its meant to do! I don't get scared by these kinds of shows anymore...I've had too many of my own experiences to get scared by something on television!"
B008V6Q8G0 As I have said before I watch all the paranormal shows I can but when I buy not one but two seasons it's proof it hooked me in but I loved every scary minute of it."
B008V6Q8G0 I love this show.  The stories are very well done.  A few are just down right scary.  My husband will not watch it - says it is too scary for him.  I think it is the best of the real life based ghost story shows out there right now."
B008V6Q8G0 Excellent episode, true to the book with additional nuances of facts and visuals. This is one, if not the best Paranormal series out there. Not campy, straight and steady, simply good!"
B008V6Q8G0 If you like Scarrrrry ghost stories, this one is very scary. All stories are true and the stories told are the type of stories that will keep you thinking even after it's over!! You won't be dissapointed. Season Two & Three are the best. But Season 1 is not so bad I would give Season 1 a 4 star!"
B008V6Q8G0 Ghosts, werewolves and UFO abduction- what more could you want? Story reenactments and eyewitness interviews combine to make this my favorite show in this genre."
B008V6Q8G0 I must admit I watch a lot of these shows. But, I do find the Paranormal Witness to be one of my favorites. This episode, by far, is one of the scariest things I have ever watched! I do find that there are even some questions that still do need to be answered and I hope that after this airs, a serious paranormal team investigates this building and reports its findings. Hope you enjoy......"
B008V90WK0 This could be a great show, but it keeps pulling back from the edge.  The premise of a smarmy sports broadcaster going through the grief stages is robust enough for a much more daring show. Matthew Perry is underused: he could deadpan the most improbable lines without losing the emotional gravitas underpinning the story.Audacity -- it's not just for Arrested Development any more."
B008V90WK0 Whether you loved him in Friends or Studio on the Sunset strip or multiple movies don.t miss this new series.  He still is hilarious but has nuances of true Emmy greatness.  The series keeps you laughing but you are left with poignant feelings for the whole cast."
B008V90WK0 While his last show failed with critics and viewers alike, this show gives Perry a chance to shine!  His quick wit and animated expressions make his slightly unlikeable character a fun part of the show.  The crazies that are along for the ride are mostly unknowns for now, but they play off Perry perfectly!"
B008V90WK0 About what you wouold expect from a politacly correct medioum talented churn it out style of writing.  Perry does do a good job with the script however."
B008V90WK0 I will definitely take a look-see at the ongoing episodes when they arrive in the Fall. Some of the writing could use tightening up but the concepts, whose suffered the most? game, the Google car, Weight Watchers and recovery, are creative and applicable to dealing with grief.  The idea that texting kills couldn't be more topical in this crazy culture.  Sadness with moments of liberating joy - good grief counseling from this program.  How these introduced topics will be furthered without becoming hackneyed - I'm curious!Since I cannot seem to review separate episodes, I wanted to add onto this one.  Episode 8, Videogame, Set, Match, is a real game changer in that Ryan finally looks outside of himself to genuinely help another person.  There is nothing smarmy, sentimental or prissy about his efforts as he feels his way through countless video games, hospital hi-jinks and false conversation starts with another member of the group.  It is genuinely funny."
B008V90WK0 This is such a fun, new, fresh comedy! I love seeing Matthew Perry at his best again!!! The storyline is so original. I love watching the different situations & the growth of the characters, which are so funny & unique. I also appreciate how it's just good humor & not relying on sex to be the main topic!! Great show, leaves you feeling good:) Well done!!!!"
B008V90WK0 We stopped watching broadcast TV in 1988, with the exception of \"Friends\", which we started watching in 2001 and found to be an excellent example of an \"ensemble cast\" working well, like the old \"Dick Van Dyke\" show, or the \"Bob Newhart\" show.  After \"Friends\" ended in 2004, the family caught several of the new series efforts by LaBlanc, Cox, Kudrow, and Perry, but really didn't take to any of them at all.  Perhaps it was the lack of the \"Friends\" chemistry, or perhaps there was just too much reliance by the producers and writers on the allure of the \"Friends\" pedigree.So having been disappointed, we didn't try this at first, but when Piper Perabo was announced (and we are \"Coyotee Ugly\" fans, and \"Covert Affairs\" was our only TV show now until \"Go On\"), we bought the first four episodes, and liked it.  We've since bought the rest of the series, and watched up to the latest.We enjoy the quips.  We like the unexpected turns the conversations take.  We question whether Mathew Perry has a thing for Courtney Cox in real life - since the female lead, Laura Benanti playing \"Lauren\", is morphing more and more into Courtney Cox's character \"Monica\" from \"Friends\" in both looks and behavior.  We like the weird characters (which, naturally, we've known someone like that at one time or another - just not so much).Piper Perabo continues to blurr her (or at least her character's) gender preferences, while being so entertaining that viewers of either sex really don't seem to mind.  Knowing that Perabo and Perry were also supposedly a couple some years back makes the episodes with Perabo even more interesting.So we look forward to further episodes, additional guest stars (but don't do the \"Friends\" guests - it will distract).  But some other previous co-stars might be interesting (Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, Bruce Willis, Neve Campbell, Oliver Platt, Elizabeth Hurley).It's very much worth a look."
B008V90WK0 I had my doubts about this show; however Matthew Perry is good, so I gave it a watch one night. Sometimes silly. Sometimes serious. Always funny!"
B008V90WK0 We thoroughly enjoy this new show.  Michael Engler is great in the lead role.  Funny but serious in parts.  I thoroughly enjoy the acting and casting did a great job of choosing the main characters.  We always check out anything Michael Engler stars in.  We have yet to find a bad show with him in the starring role.  Highly recommended."
B008V90WK0 This is the best new comedy in ages and ages.  It is funny from start to finish.  Also thought provoking.  My entire family, from the teens to the adults love this show!"
B008X0SGDC Good start to the series.  I have only watched the one episode, but had a very gritty historical feel to it, not a fake vibe.  The story kept me interested and I'll continue watching."
B008X0SGDC I liked this show more and more with each episode. The historical aspect provides challenges for the police unique to most cop shows. Cast is great and the story-telling is really good."
B008X0SGDC I have been watching season 1 and this series is truly awesome. Fantastic story plot for each episode. Also, it takes place in the Victorian era which is another highlight. Every episode leave one wondering what is going to happen in the following episode. I highly recommend it."
B008X0SGDC Pre Justified a different Civil War take, lots of blood, action and a very dark story line. I can not wait for the new season."
B008X0SGDC I watched all episodes and enjoyed it: good action, sympathetic people, interesting plot. If you start watching to see if this is entertaining for you, give it at least 2 episodes before you make up your mind."
B008X0SGDC Kept my interest from first movie thru to the end of the last. Good watching. Would definitely recomnend for others"
B008X0SGDC When I turned this series on for the first time and saw BBC, I immediately turned it off because I did not want to have to fight to understand what was going on through thick British accents. Days later I decided to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. This is a mystery suspense series that has numerous storylines that happen at one time and occasionally coincide with each other.  Give it a shot. You might like it."
B008X0SGDC I love how this show is so accurate in the events. Seems to take me right back to the 1800s. Lots of dirty words and women!!"
B008X0SGDC I loved this series.  It has great characters.  Lots of plot twists and intrigue.  I highly recommend it if you like a good period piece."
B008X0SGDC The show copper is very entertaining. And has a good plot to it would love to see 2nd season come on soon"
B008X0SGDC Too bloody, violent and there was nudity and explicit sex scenes in the first five minutes......Not my type of entertainment...at all.  It was not evident that this was in the show by reading the synopsis or I wouldn't have rented it."
B008X0SGDC extremely well done, great costumes and great stage sets. The filming was top notch. This series made me feel like I was there and it was captivating. I sure hope there is a second season"
B008X0SGDC Great story line so far, I am just getting into this one. It has become quite the adiction. Life in earlier times seems to be depicted very well."
B008X0SGDC THis was a very hard story to follow.  The characters were not distinct or outstanding.  They blended together too much.  Although the story is set in the olden days of the US, it has foreign directions which becomes obvious as the stories unfold."
B008X0SGDC Ever since \"The Gangs of New York\" I have loved the ferment of Civil War New York.  So I am primed to love this show, and the sets and costuming do not disappoint.  However, much of the plot is nonsensical and the acting is wildly uneven.  I'll keep watching, but I hope the rest of the show rises to the level of its surfaces."
B008X0SGDC good story line/authentic characters realistic setting enjoy continued story line with individual crime solving and makes me want more seasons"
B008X0SGDC Doing a period piece is always a challenge.  The show's dark atmosphere gives it a feel that it's shot in a studio or production lot.  It's a little too gritty and most of time I was thinking how bad everyone and everything must have smelled back then.  The acting is good, but I feel it relies too much on the main character's charisma (which isn't extraordinary). The show's greatest weakness is the writing which only as a spark of originality."
B008X0SGDC The writer's went over-board justifying the angry black man. The plots were lose and poorly written. The characters weren't believable and I found myself drifting off watching the series to the point I stopped halfway through. Bad In every aspect."
B008X0SGDC But now I AM hooked.  Recommended by a trusted friend so I stuck with it and am now completely into the characters.  Great post Civil War setting and an excellent character study."
B008X0SGDC If you liked DEADWOOD, you will love this one; a blend of cop-mystery and historic period themes with a crisp and intelligent script."
B008X0SGDC A very gritty part of New York's history makes for riveting watching. I recommend it to anyone who likes History and Mystery."
B008X0SGDC I have not watched TV since 2007 but just buy DVD's. I liked the fact COPPER was a \"period piece\" but it wasn't anything like I expected. I saw it to be VERY violent & very graphic (I'm sorry, but I don't need to see people throwing up, people being shot and chopped up and LOTS of blood, or people having sex)  I wasn't crazy about a lot of the subject matter in the episodes either.BBC is a lot more lenient in \"censorship\" so there is also nudity, bad language, and definitely blatant sexual material. (I would not recommend this for young people. Then again, kids today are so desensitized......)  The show was fairly well done (but moved a little slow many times) and I liked that they were doing \"new forensics\" (for the time), but I won't be buying season 2 and I will be giving season 1 away to a friend."
B008X0SGDC Love the story lines hate the cussing! can anyone make a show now without cussing. sheesh... hope corky can kick his habit and they make him a hero you can root for."
B008X0SGDC The differences between rich and poor are vividly portrayed, as is the corruption that seems rampant.  The lack of options for women and girls and the grinding poverty is horribly evident.  The attitudes of racism make it hard to believe the story takes place in the North.  However, there are hopeful sparks of decency that flare, unexpectedly."
B008X0SGDC The Season 1 of Copper is very interesting and enjoyable viewing. It is very violent, however, and is not for the young or weak of stomach."
B008X0SGDC If you are looking for a grimly realistic historical series look no further. Be ready for some pretty ugly images of the underside of Civil War torn New York. Depending on its accuracy this is an enlightening look at the Irish immigration, slum development, racism and civil corruption in the big, bad apple. We'll acted but look out: The action is often graphically bloody."
B008X0SGDC This series is violent, but there is a great story line.  If you like action and suspense, this is a series to view."
B008X0SGDC We loved the first season of this show so much that we couldn't wait for season 2.  The bad news is that a recent article said there will not be a third season."
B008X0SGDC This is a smart series.  On one hand you have three Union soldiers, one of which is both rich and crippled as a result of the war, one a black doctor and the third a New York detective, hence the title, Copper.  On the other hand you have New York 5 Points with all its steamy secrets.NYPD, never short of a little bribery, graft, swindling, etc., during the era, provides a nice backdrop to our main character, Corky, as he tries to solve crimes for the benefit of all men - black or white.There's no shortage of intrigue nor ladies.  Some of the ladies, and I use the term loosely, provide comfort for Corky, while another, a widow far more refined and high born, would like to do the same.Sometimes the series is hard to keep my focus.  However, that's more to my detriment than that of an issue of writing or acting.  It's a fine show but it isn't what I feel to be a GREAT show."
B008X0SGDC The Canadians & Brits really know how to make a good series. Can't wait till next season is put on Amazon."
B008X0SGDC A raw show based on the history of NYC in 1864.  Reflects the biases and class tensions of the time as well as the corruption of the police force and politics."
B008X0SGDC Pretty good series. Crime detective with a taste of CSI but from the year 1865. I like the time period and hopefully some if not all of the things that occur are historically accurate and depict the &#34;way ff life&#34; that people endured back then."
B008X0SGDC This show is well written and the characters are great. The story is a little rough at times but you have to consider the time line. I think men are more likely to like this show than women because of that."
B008X0SGDC Definitely the worst TV show out there. Don't believe the reviews. I wanted to like this. It seemed like it would be absolutely amazing. I thought this show would be an accurate depiction of police back in the mid-19th century. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the black medical examiner working like Dexter trying to figure out how the girl died in the first episode. I had remembered what I had read about detective techniques in 1880's London. They basically did nothing that was shown on the show, and this takes place in the 1860's. Other things just made me roll my eyes. It reminded me of how lazy Detroit 187 was. They hired Michael Imperioli to play a detective in Detroit and even had him asking his coworkers if they wanted to get a slice. Facepalm! Seems the show was probably originally set in New Yawk and no one bothered to adjust the dialogue, or even try.Mercifully, I quit this show before they brought up anything about Shake Shack or Iphones. What a load of wasted potential."
B008X0SGDC I like the twists and turns. Five Corners is depicted very well. Someone did some real research when they put the sets and costumes together."
B008X0SGDC I was really glad to see this come out on Blu-ray in a set. This is a great series by BBC and it reminds me of &#34; Gangs of New York &#34; crossed with HBO's &#34;Deadwood&#34;.It takes place in the Five Points of New York and it has a great storyline and plot. It is in the same league as any of the major cable network channels and I love the fact that it was not on one of the premium channels. This is a great show and hope it returns for a second season. It is not as graphic as Gangs was, but it has its moments. Highly recommended."
B008X0SGDC I enjoy watching full season series in rotation without advertising on Amazon Prime. This is impossible for me to do when watching weekly. This series is I believe very realistic over all excluding exterior views of buildings with only one chimney that is located opposite the kitchen or even better modern gutters and downspouts on buildings in 1865. These things don't affect the story but are fun to find."
B008X0SGDC I really enjoy this show.  It is not, however, for the faint-hearted.  It has more than a few scenes that will make your stomach dance.  It is definitely adult material, so don't plan to watch with your younger set around."
B008X0SGDC This is one of the best series on TV. An excellent cooperative effort between the BBC, American production and Canadian location."
B008X0SGDC We pretty much found this show by accident, and I am glad we did. It's a great BBC show. The acting and action is great. Hope they keep this running for awhile."
B008X0SGDC Original and entertaining new series, looking forward to the new season.  Interesting peek into Irish in New York around the time of the Civil War."
B008X0SGDC By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiIt's 1864. The Civil War is in full swing.Kevin Corcoran (Tom Weston-Jones) is an Irish immigrant policeman, who is trying to keep the peace in the notorious Five Points neighborhood, in New York City.He has rotated out of the Union Army, and trying to capture a group of bank robbers. During the stakeout he comes in contact with Annie, a young girl, with no parents, and surviving off the street. He gives her an egg. She offers to repay him with sex. He tells her he's not like that, and just then the criminals leave the bank.Later the same day, he's called to a murder scene. It's Annie. He carries the body to Matthew Freeman, an African-American doctor, who had served with him in the Union Army. Freeman helps Kevin from time to time with autopsies and the like.Still later he sees Annie, very much alive, and being kidnapped. It turns out she had a twin sister. Annie keeps propositioning him, unable to understand that all men are not like the one who killed her sister. Our reluctant foster father has to find suitable living quarters for the young girl and figure out who murdered her sister and why.Other characters include Robert Morehouse (Kyle Schmid) the son of a wealthy Fifth Avenue industrialist, who was Kevin and Freeman's major in the Union Army; Elizabeth Haverford (Anastasia Griffith) the English wife of a wealthy Firth-Avenue friend of Morehouse and Francis Maguire (Kevin Ryan), one of Kevin's only friends, and fellow detective.This is a great serial you may have missed. All 10 episodes are available on DVD and Blu-Ray."
B008X0SGDC This is a spectacular series that is set in New York City in 1864.  Copper is Kevin Corcoran who a tough Irish cop trying to do a good job at controlling the crime, murders and other criminal acts taking place in his beat.  Sometimes he has to take the entire legal system in his own hands as the rich seem to be untouchable by the law.  Kevin (Tom Weston-Jones) goes far beyond the job and he uses advanced forensic principles with the help of a black doctor Matthew Freeman (Ato Essandoh).Kevin always tries to find the guilty party and protect the innocent.  He is grief stricken that his daughter was murdered and his wife is missing.  He still searches for evidence every day in the hopes to find his wife and seek vengeance on the murderer of his daughter....The acting in the movie is simply outstanding and this series rivals the best that I have ever seen.  The topics can be very blunt and brutal at times and that may offend some people.  Child prostitution, murder, violence and other crimes are openly presented in the series.  It presents what the director and the story writers believe to be a real world picture of the big city in that time period.The series clearly and openly shows the games of the wealthy New Yorkers and their plans for the city and the problems of the immigrants and the black population.  Racism was rampant and all races are considered inferior.  The Civil War is winding down and the rich are preparing to reap the benefits of a booming New York expansion and they will take care of anyone who gets in their way.The series is directed and produced at the highest levels and I loved the roles of Kevin (Tom Weston-Jones) and Matthew Freeman (Ato Essandoh) the friendship and tension between the two is electric at times.  Robert Morehouse (Kyle Schmid) plays a rich young man whose father wants to take over the city.  Robert, Matthew and Kyle are friends from the civil war where they fought together.Excellent story, it is brash and open in its depiction of the crimes and racism that existed at that time.  It is a 5 star series and well worth the time to watch it.  My wife and I liked it a lot and I recommend it to you.  Just be aware that it covers some very difficult topics that may shock or offend you.I was provided with a copy of the DVD and asked only to give a fair and honest review."
B008X0SGDC I've been catching up on other shows and I finally got the the chance of watch this show from beginning to end and I really did like the show, can't wait for the second season."
B008X0SGDC This series isn't for the faint of heart.  The writers have done a fabulous job depicting the area known as 5 Points with all the filth, corruption, child pornography, bigotry and political shenanigans of the time.  Husbands and Fathers is a statement on how one man can be caring, loving and nurturing of the woman in his life while another is just the opposite.If you're a history buff, this series won't disappoint."
B008X0SGDC Kind of violent but you see a lot of that sort of thing today on TV.Someone who can be mean when appropriate and caring too when all the shooting and stabbing is over."
B008X0SGDC I bought this series for my kids to watch over the holidays.  I already watched the first season and I loved it.  My kids are looking forward to seeing this series from BBC America.  I wasn't sure what to expect from BBC America but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was also impressed by the sets and the costumes.  I was afraid they would be cheap but I was wrong.  I highly recommend."
B008X0SGDC We tried watching this show and it didn't pull either of us in at all. About 3/4 of the way through the first episode we agreed that this show wasn't something we were going to add to our Amazon Prime watchlist."
B008X0SGDC Like the Characters and time period that it takes place in.  The Coppers pay attention to details used to help solve cases."
B008X0SGDC NO SPOILERS:As K. Harris did the heavy lifting. I can provide a more granular viewpoint re: what I like about Copper.While some \"poetic license\" has to be allowed, as a student of history, BBC America nailed it!  The time period has been covered before in the big budget \"Gangs of New York\" who took somewhat more of a \"poetic license\" than BBC America.The Irish as a growing minority, the winding down of the Civil War, Tammany Hall, The integration of Blacks, the role of woman, the gap between rich and poor (& the fostering of well-known industrial titans) and general cleanliness (it might be a small thing, though look at the dirt caked nails of some of the main characters) are all topics prevalent to the time period.Copper is both well-acted and well scripted.  Franka Potente stands out with her best performance since \"Run Lola Run.\"The storyline itself might only merit a *4 rating, though historical accuracy bumps Copper up to *5 IMHO.  Truth be told, I do have an ancillary motive, as my hope is that both commercial and critical acceptance of Copper will not only encourage BBC America to script additional programs, but that they will also open up the vaults by expanding their current offerings menu to include many of the fine programs that US audiences can only currently obtain through purchase."
B008X0SGDC It is a very gritty black and white story in a sense. I didn't know if with all of the violence I would lose interest but so far I like it. I live in NY almost my entire life but knew next too nothing about the five points before they became their current incarnations of Manhattan. I am enjoying the chemistry between the different characters and the main protagonist."
B008X0SGDC We looked forward to this show with great anticipation. After 3 episodes it became repetitive. The show did not seem to get beyond the shock of having a little girl want to be a prostitute. Nothing interesting about showing a little girl in the sex trade. There was not any spark between the characters, nor great acting. We could predict every plot line. We stopped purchasing the episodes."
B008X0SGDC One of the most ambitious new shows to be produced by the BBC is actually set on American soil. What's up with that? And \"Copper\" arrives with one of the season's most impressive pedigrees! Oscar winner Barry Levinson (6 total nominations with \"Rain Man\" earning him a Best Director prize) and Tom Fontana (3 Emmy wins for writing on \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Homicide: Life on the Streets\") are the creative forces behind the series set in New York's immigrant neighborhood of Five Points. Set shortly after the Civil War, \"Copper\" showcases the unruly lawlessness that runs rampant in a city struggling to define itself. The streets are filled with murder, illicit sex, and unchecked racism. At the same time, the wealthy are embroiled in political scandal, dubious business dealings, and an equal proportion of unqualified racism. Straddling these two worlds is Kevin Corcoran (Tom Weston-Jones in a star making role), a good cop who's not above coloring outside of the lines to pursue the truth or enact justice.Corcoran is introduced as a troubled soul reeling from personal tragedy. Despite being a copper who commonly takes refuge in a house of ill repute, he also has ties to a more elite base of friends. Oftentimes within \"Copper,\" these two divergent paths are at odds. In my opinion, that is one of the most fascinating aspects of the show. The lives of the rich are expertly juxtaposed to the travails of the less fortunate. Within its crime format, there are a lot of different topics struggling for attention within a crowded plot line. There are episodic crimes to solve, there is the long-range mystery of Corcoran's family, there is commentary on the immigrant experience, there is the birth of forensic science, there is the racial element, there is a land grab conspiracy, and there are anti-Lincoln politcal machinations. And not every weekly case is as compelling as some of the more enduring storylines, but the show never lacks for ambition. Expertly produced, the series creates a believable historical portrait of its specific setting.In addition to its terrific production values, there is a great cast at work. Weston-Jones makes a fascinating anti-hero. He's not perfect or even necessarily good, but he tries to be just. But there is a scary ruthlessness simmering just beneath the surface that can lead to some unexpected acts of aggression. Kyle Schmid plays a rich ally with just enough mystery that we never know exactly what his real agenda might be. Equal parts charm and smarm, I really like Schmid in this. Franka Potente as the convenient lady in Weston-Jones life, Kevin Ryan as his faithful partner, Anastasia Griffith as a wealthy society matron, and Kiara Glasco as a troubled girl all make an early impact as well. In fact, as the season progresses--Glasco develops into one of the most unorthodox, strangely fascinating and disturbing characters that I've seen in quite a while. And Ato Essandoh scores as a black doctor that our hero employs (to much controversy and consternation) to look at bodies and evidence.Season One is comprised of ten episodes. As I mentioned, some stories are inherently more compelling than others. If anything, the show probably tries to cover too much. As much as I like Essandoh's performance, his progressive forensic know-how seems awfully convenient. But every time the plot lines veer, Weston-Jones in on hand to ground the action. Thoroughly unpredictable, his energy makes \"Copper\" really unique. It may not be a perfect show, but you can't fault the ambitious attempt to stand apart from traditional television fare. Give it a look if you enjoy more complex TV designed for adults. KGHarris, 9/12."
B008X0SGDC This series is not typically one I would choose to watch, but much to my surprise I could not stop watching it!  The historical setting appeared to be accurate with a sometimes heart wrenching view into what the personal lives of that era could have been.  The characters are so believable I found myself wishing I could talk to them with encouragement and compassion.  If this series is dropped from production a huge mistake would have been made by those who made that decision."
B008X0SGDC The main character very charismatic, gritty and very rough around the edges. I am most intrigued by Copper and look forward to what happens next. Tough guy with a sensitive side, most interesting."
B008X0SGDC With all of the recent politicking, mostly of the he-said, no he-said, variety, this episode reminds us of the history before us for which we should be so appreciative.  There is a texture and color to this series which is finally sinking in for me:  the gray grit, brown filth, little bathing, garbage in the streets and stark classicism.  The yellowish-brown filter enveloping the entire environment, even in the woods, does not simply set an historic period of time but reinforces the corruption, licentiousness and risk of living and doing one's job. Medicines and treatments are limited and alcohol seems to be the only comfort besides prostitution.  The story line has become more complicated as the Lincoln election completes.  Rather than simply editorializing on dissatisfied results, an entire crew of people work to burn New York City to the ground.  However historically accurate or inaccurate this is, I feel grateful that \"talking heads\" are what we have to worry about, ad nauseum , with our coming presidential election."
B008X0SGDC I see Copper as a no holds barred, gritty English action hit.  The main character anchors the cast well. Good work by all involved."
B008X0SGDC good action show set in 1865 new York city, it is quite violentand bloody with adult themes, it is entertaining and appearswell researched, with good acting."
B008X0SGDC I did not watch much of this as i felt it was not worth my time. Not a good choice."
B008X0SGDC It's basically a blend of Gangs of New York and Ripper Street.  It's not historically accurate.  If you just watch it realizing it's just a fantasy series rather than historical, it's decent."
B008X0SGDC I'm sorry if this is nit-picky, but NO respectable lady would allow herself to be in the same room, let alone the same house, as a prostitute, and no respectable gentleman would allow his wife to stay in that room/house. I don't care if the owner of the house thought it was okay or not, his guests would have left as soon as the \"ho\" walked in. This was the Victorian period...ladies did NOT mingle with prostitutes. Do the writers seriously not know this??? I thought this show was trying to be historically accurate.And the women's dresses in this episode were atrocious. I noticed how ugly they were in previous episodes, but I was willing to overlook that, until this episode. A very recent widow--who should still be in mourning, I don't care who she thinks she is, or how open-minded she is--would NEVER show herself in public in a WHITE ballgown! Are you kidding me???  Who is the costumer on this show? Not only was it white, but it looked like a wedding gown...HELLO!!  Again, who is dressing these people?!! I guess I'm just used to the higher quality and attention to detail I see on other BBC shows like Downton Abbey, for example. I've never seen such deplorable costumes on a BBC show in this century! And don't try to argue there was a war going on. This was the North, and these people are supposed to be VERY wealthy. They can afford the best silks and satins, etc. So the women should be dressed to fit their station. They don't seem to have a problem dressing the wh@res to look like wh@res...why can't they dress the upper class characters correctly?I could have overlooked these seemingly minor details except it seems as if great pains have been taken with the rest of the show to make it as accurate as possible, so the whole costume debacle is just sad, bad, and beyond my comprehension.Then there's the awful acting, that I won't even go into.The first several episodes were interesting, but once the bad acting became too much to bear any longer, and the hideous costumes made my eyes bleed with their ugliness, I had to stop watching. If this show gets another season, I hope they get a bigger budget and can afford some better costumes and more talented actors."
B008X0SGDC This TV series goes back in time to what it may been like in New York for an officer of the law. I enjoyed it so far."
B008X0SGDC Cleverly constructed to give an apparent authentic view of the competence and incompetence of the embryo policing in the 5 Points area of New York following the end of the Civil War. Draws you in, also the sets, direction and acting are all of a high standard. Definitely worth watching. Tom Weston - Jones is the glue that holds it all together."
B008X0SGDC I was surprised.  Ready for more.The costumes and scenery are seem very authentic.I am glad Amazon is creating the series."
B008X0SGDC I use to hate westerns when I was little. My dad watched them all. Of course, then that was all the black and white tvhad to offer.  This is like &#34;Justified&#34;. It is back in the day, but very modern. It is a refreshing change to what is currently on the television, and I don't mean reruns. It is simple, but smart."
B008X0SGDC I think this is a wonderful new show! I'm glad it comes on right after one of my favorite shows \"Hell on Wheels\". I think they did an awesome job with this new show and I hope it keeps running!"
B008X0SGDC COPPER is a cop show set in New York City during the Civil War.But, this is not the New York police force as seen on LAW & ORDER.  This department is filled with corruption.  Police brutality and vigilante justice run rampant, and, of course, there is no such thing as a search warrant.Created by Tom Fontana, Will Rokos and executive produced by Barry Levinson, the ten episode, one-hour series is filled with intriguing characters and shocking plot-twists that will surprise even the most astute viewers of television drama.Detective Kevin Corcoran (Tom Weston-Jones) returns home to 1864 New York from the Civil War battlefields to discover that his daughter has been murdered and his wife has disappeared.  Assigned to Five Points, the most dangerous area of the city, Corcoran seeks the truth about what happened to his family while investigating different crimes, such as the murder of a child, which his superiors would prefer to cover up because the killer is a politically-connected member of New York's upper class.Quite often, Corcoran's investigations lead him to the emerging African-American community in Northern Manhattan, or to the steps of the New York elite on Fifth Avenue, and, in one story arc, he and a wealthy friend (Kyle Schmidt) uncover a Confederate plot to burn the city to the ground.COPPER is a truly engrossing series that does a superb job of recreating a troubled time and place in America's past.  Aside from Weston-Jones and Schmidt, the fine cast includes Kevin Ryan, Dylan Taylor, Anastasia Griffith, Ato Essandoh, Kiara Glasco and Franka Potente.The three-disc DVD set from BBC Video includes sever \"Behind the Scenes\" featurettes and deleted scenes. Michael B. Druxman"
B008X0SGDC This show is awesome. I loved every episode and was glad to finally find a show that my wife was happy to sit down and watch with me! Everything about this show is spectacular....directing, acting, plot."
B008X0SGDC Could only watch three episodes. Blatant attempt to manipulate emotions over abused little girls-- then episode ends by using little girl to accomplish what no self-respecting (and copper isn't) lawman should do for the sake of justice. Series fits the mold of stories from graphic novels-- to give excuse for over indulgence and short cut the plots"
B008X0SGDC A good cop show taking place just before civil war is over - 1860's New York.  An American-Irish cop patrolling the 5 points of New York.  When it comes to the law, Corcoran isn't always an angel.  Kevin'll steal from crocks, but he does want justice for the guilty and protection for all the innocents.An all star cast.  Tom Weston-Jones (MI-5Episode 1) as Kevin Corcoran. Anastasia Griffith (Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season) as the wealthy and ignorant Elizabeth Haverford.Franka Potente, in my opinion, is the big star of the show.  (Run Lola RunandThe Bourne Identity) She plays the Madam Eva Heissen.The characters are well developed and believable.  The plot suspense is good and each episode with a new plot twist.  I recommend this show to all those who enjoy a good cop show or 1860 New York 5 points gangs period piece."
B008X0SGDC I admit that I had doubts when I read about the premise of Copper. Happily, the show exceeded my expectations. The plots and the acting are excellent. The cultural differences between now and the US Civil War era are well drawn. The action is well paced and at times very exciting. The historical perspectives are often surprisingly interesting. Well done!"
B008X0SGDC Excellent....Story lines are great.Can be intense at times.Try watching with no interruptions when viewing.Bring more Copper on...."
B008X0SGDC Copper has a great gritty realism that not everyone will like as it really does not pull a lot of punches, deal with heavy subjects and is not afraid to make you feel the pain from it.  Each episode has gotten better and at this point im pretty hooked."
B008X0SGDC A tragic episode about betrayal and unforgivable trespass. The clues have been strung masterfully along in perfectly timed doses to guide the viewer to the realization at the right moment.No one wins here. Corky loses the most, and asks for the most from those close to him. He is a juggernaut pointed at disaster without a way to turn aside.Corky is not the only one with trouble. Robert Morehouse is still tied into the rebel plot to destroy New York and Kennedy the confederate spy is pushing for a greater commitment and speed from him. Robert thinks he has the upper hand, but perhaps not. He proves to be unusually astute, hopefully he will be afforded time to save his father from ruin. During war time no one is allowed to be neutral. And certainly not to profit from both sides. To do so is called treason.Ellen is a waif-like addition who wrenches the heart. No, this can't end well. The actress is perhaps the least convincing of all so far. Even so, Corky carries the scenes with her as the story comes out.Mrs Haverford falls gently into the usual female need to be the center of attention at all times. She remains naive and sheltered, even as she feels herself a more liberated woman of the upper class. Robert tries to share his feelings for Corcoran, and Elizabeth doesn't hear it, she needs Robert to accept that she too deserves to be trusted, her self absorption remains intact.Eva shows uncharacteristic sensitivity and loyalty.Corky refuses to listen to his Captain, he lays down the law as he sees it. Sullivan is humiliated, and Corky continues down his chosen path, undeterred.A momentary peace as we see the Freemans' holiday meal being set. Sarah has opened up enough to express concern for Ellen Corcoran. The tranquility of the scene only emphasizes the true disaster of all rest.Annie is either recovering or she is plotting. There is no way to tell. Corky is coming to rely on her, it remains to be seen if that path will lead to a redemption or to further tragedy.Blackmail again raises its head. Plenty of pain to go around. There are, after all, lines Corky won't cross though he comes close, he is not a peaceful man, nor a man of peace. Over and over he resorts to violence. There is no gentleness left in him.It is all such a muddled mess. I can hardly wait for the next(last) episode of season 1. I need to know how it ends. Not for the faint of heart, this entire season."
B008X0SGDC What a great show! The character building is great, and the scenery and backdrop for the storyline is believable. Can't wait for season 2!"
B008X0SGDC Life in the Five Points area of NYC in the 1860's was harsh, as my own ancestors could have attested. Things were made worse by the low character of some of its residents, but there were also good people, like the main characters, who tried to do right, sometimes aided, and sometime impeded, by their social, but not always moral, &#34;betters.&#34; This show takes you right into the middle of it all -- and is definitely only for adults."
B008X0SGDC Refreshing show, not what you expect, the beginning of State hood and the people that held &#34;order&#34; referred to as Coopers. all episodes were great,"
B008X0SGDC I saw this on the BBC channel, & fell in love with it. It is about the Police of New York city in the mid 1800's."
B008X0SGDC Can't wait for the next season, it really is a well done and holds your attention.  It's very hard to keep from wayching the entire season at one sitting."
B008X0SGDC Gritty crime drama set during the Civil War era. The main story is centered in the Irish-American community in New York. The main characters are Irish detectives (&#34;coppers&#34;). Intriguing storyline with a few unexpected twists. Well executed, well acted. I hope BBC continues this series."
B008X0SGDC To see such detail given for a TV time period piece is a delight. With only a preview to look at, I am intrigued. Looking forward to watching it in full glory."
B008X0SGDC This series is entertaining.  Initially, the characters are a little difficult to understand because of their accents, but the action is good and the story grows in interest with each episode."
B008X0SGDC I really like the time period for which this show takes place and a look at what is was like for the general public back then (if you can believe them). It's an interesting time during the end of the civil war. The character development and mix is good for a first season show. I'm looking forward to watching season 2."
B008X0SGDC Yet another fantasy produced by Jews (Sherri Rufh, Sam Berliner, Barry Levinson, et al) that prominently feature a black expert, in this case, forensics. Since we know that none such existed in the 1800's, the intentional but subtle brainwashing message here is that there would have been if not for the cruel, ignorant bigoted white society that prevented it, for which we should feel guilty and make atonement. Have you figured that out yet? And in productions that are present-day, it's the message that blacks are fit to rule over us and we should submit to them (when in reality they serve as fronts for Jewish political power). But please explain why in real life there are virtually no black physicists, black philosphers, black mathematicians, black brain surgeons, black rocket scientists, black engineers...heck, there are hardly any black auto mechanics! Could it have anything to do with the fact that where whites have an average IQ of 100, for black Africans it's 70, and for black americans (with most of them having some admixture of white), its only 85? Only in Jewish-produced film and TV are we constantly barraged with this propaganda. Even Barack Obama is only half-black, is of average intelligence (at best), was a failure at Occidental and only got into Columbia because he did so as a foreign exchange student from Malaysia, AND he's purely a media-creature paid for by Goldman-Sachs (again, Jewish)."
B008X0SGDC Set in New York during the Civil War, I found this series very interesting.  The end of the season dragged a little, but it was entertaining and informative.  I am a history buff and know a lot about the Civil War, but I tend to forget that not every person was fighting in the war.  This show reminded me that there were people leaving normal lives outside the battles and that politics was corrupted then, also.  I am looking forward to Season 2."
B008X0SGDC They have done their research on the time period and on the Irish.  I was instantly hooked from the historical point, the drama just make it better."
B008X0SGDC When I found this series on Amazon Prime had to sit down and watch the series back to back for a couple days til I was done."
B008X0SGDC I really like them if you do, take a look at this show. Don't stop at the first episode view a few your bound to like gritty, in your face historic cop drama"
B008X0SGDC It was a little dark on screen, but I kept on watching it. It got better as time went on. It has quite a story of an age in time that I was not very familiar with."
B008X0SGDC Wow, this is a great show. It gives you an idea of how rugged life was in NY's city in the mid-1800's... definitely for mature audiences. The acting is superb, costumes, story-line, music: all over the top."
B008X0SGDC I'm half way through the first season and really enjoying it.  I don't recommend this for children or teens, way too graphic.  Makes me want to research living in the late 1800's."
B008X0SGDC A fun romp through Civil War NYC--great fun. The cast fits well together and gives us an historical glimpse back 150 years."
B008X0SGDC This is a great series set in 1860's New York at the time of the Civil War. The series centers on the character of an Irish immigrant policeman that has a fierce sense of what is right and wrong. It is full of intense scenes and captures the visceral sense of how violent and wild the country was at that time. It is a fabulous drama series that you don't won't to miss!  BBC has outdone themselves!"
B008X0SGDC Just came across this on my Kindle Fire HD, started watching the shows as I was working out. Found them entertaining, with good story lines and interesting characters. Looking forward to the 2nd season."
B008X0SGDC Shock, it was about New York, segregation of ethnic groups during the Civil War, mainly IRISH immigrants. Very edge of the seat series."
B008X0SGDC Coppers is a interesting show. It reminds me of Deadwood, it seems realistic and the storyline keeps you wondering. The actors are  good."
B008X0SGDC &#34;Copper&#34; is a very cool character and I liked him a lot. Story line seems a little weak as the 1st season progresses, but still have more episodes to watch."
B008X0SGDC I'm loving this show.  It is not shot as well as Deadwood but the accents are correct unlike Deadwood who only kept the Chinese accent.  Anyway this show is gritty and dark and messed up just like it was.  The characters are complicated.  It is a great show that reminds me personally that the police in America were really started by the Irish."
B008X0SGDC Copper is a period drama, set in New York of the 1860's featuring an Irish-American detective and Civil-War veteran Kevin Corcoran who's tasked with fighting crime in an increasingly lawless environment, simultaneously resisting wide-spread corruption in his own profession all the while attempting to unravel the mystery of his missing wife and murdered daughter.I'm not usually into dark-underside-of-society thematically but Copper looks like such a well-crafted production (sort of \"Tombstone\" meets \"Gangs of New York\") featuring: an outstanding cast of international actors, a visually distinctive use of color & light, costumes & sets lending a feel of authenticity and a pretty solid script that I found to be very engaging.  Individual performanc
B008X0SGDC Life was tough in Five Corners for all dwellers. If you liked &#34;Gangs of New York&#34;, you will like this series."
B008X0SGDC Loved this series when it was on tv, but it got cancelled.  So I am so happy it is available in DVD."
B008X0SGDC How could the BBC and HBO do such a poor job?  The true grit and integrity of performances we've come to expect from both British television and HBO was utterly lacking.  What was Levinson thinking?  We can usually count on him, too."
B008X0SGDC Great new series from BBC.  I'm glad someone decided to finally make a show about post-Civil War America-this set in New York City...fantastic period and location for good drama."
B008X0SGDC Set in New York City in 1864, \"Copper\" is a 19th century procedural/mystery series following Kevin Corcoron an Irish immigrant working as a police officer. While fighting the south during the Civil War Corcoron's wife disappeared and his daughter murdered. Returning to police work after serving in the army, Corcoron obsessively tries to track down where his wife disappeared to and who was behind the murder of his daughter. Corcoron uses two connections from the war--the son of a wealthy industrialist and African American surgeon--to help solve crime in the Five Points area.The first season of the BBC series looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut. We get 10 episodes (the first season of the series) spread over two discs. Blacks are fairly solid and detail remarkably sharp.The audio sounds quite nice as well with a lossless presentation of the British-Canadian TV series co-produced by director Barry Levinson. I should note that the audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and isn't a lossless presentation which is a bit of a surprise.I haven't seen the DVD set.The special features are quite good for the set as well. Strangely, the episodes that have commentary tracks appear to be on the disc TWICE on the discs. You have to click on the episode listed (and it appears that there are more than 10 episodes on the two discs because of this)to hear the commentary track and, when you do, you can only listen to the audio commentary--you're not able to toggle back between the regular soundtrack and the audio commentary (something I'll do if the commentary isn't the most revealing). It's an odd choice as usually the Blu-ray is enabled with the ability to toggle back and forth by just hitting the audio button on your remote. The first time I played the episodes with audio commentary, it was a bit confusing. Hopefully, in the future, BBC will be a bit clearer about this or allow you to just access the audio commentary by clicking on the audio button.The episodes with audio commentaries are:\"Surviving Death\", with Tom Weston-Jones and Franka Potente\"Husbands and Fathers\", with Tom Weston-Jones and Franka Potente\"La Tempte\", with Kyle Schmid and Anastasia Griffith\"Better Times Are Coming\", with Tom Weston-Jones, Kyle Schmid and Ato Essandoh\"A Vast and Fiendish Plot\", with Tom Weston-Jones, Kyle Schmid and Ato EssandohWe also get six \"character galleries\" where the actors talk about their characters and their various relationships in the series. They are brief often featuring the same footage and, although a bit lean, are interesting.There are also 11 behind-the-scenes promotional featurettes focusing on different aspects of the production from the production design to historical accuracy. All of these are, strangley, presented in 1080i not 1080p but, I suspect, these are the same promo pieces that were on the website and they were never converted to 1080p.\"Fontana in Five Points\" allows the series creator to visit the various real locations where the series is set. Fontana provides quite a bit of history about the real people that lived during the time as well as the background on the series. It's an excellent presentation that runs under 13 minutes.Equally impressive is \"Behind the Badge\" a brief documentary on the series creation that runs over 44 minutes.The option of watching the show in Ultraviolet streaming is also available but itunes is not offered as an option.Finally we get 24 deleted scenes for the series as well as a couple of trailers for other BBC TV series.A fascinating historical drama, \"Copper\" benefits from a terrific high def presentation. Although the audio commentaries are presented a bit strangely (and might confuse some) and some of the featurettes are in 1080i rather than 1080p, this is, on the whole an exceptional presentation of the series.Recommended."
B008X0SGDC This is a great new series with laughable moments, but historic accuracies with things like gangs and limited, corrupted law all the way to stealing elections.  Love this show."
B008X0SGDC Very bloody. um. Didnt get too far...in.. Might not have given it much of a chance I guess on reflection. It just was very .. bloody."
B008X0SGDC Copper is a dirty, gritty backhanded compliment to the time period in which it is set - 1800's, NYC-Fivepoints. The main character is interestingly flawed and the main storyline as well as the subplots are loosely woven, great in their presentation. I also like the fact that one of the primary characters is a black man who is learned and not a stereo type."
B008X0SGDC Thank you, BBC for this series! There have been two previous period series which have been so creatively done, with such a sense and feel of the time: Carnivale & Deadwood. The Irish dialect used was a little difficult to make out at first but once I picked up the rhythm, it was almost like music. I knew the lead looked familiar but didn't place him as having been in MI5. There are things around the house that need to be done but I still have two episodes to go!"
B008X0SSDU Both Seasons 1 & 2 of Hell on Wheels were excellent, fresh and worth paying for!The actors were all memorable, well chosen and exceptional in their abilities.I look forward to another Season!"
B008X0SSDU This season really drove the characters along in a way that made me hate having to wait each week for the new episode.  Excellent writing, quality characters and a constant character growth that is unmatched in the new age of schadenfreude and simplicity.  I appreciate a show that makes me keep up to date and treats me like I'm smart enough to follow the plot."
B008X0SSDU I'm getting more and more hooked on this show each season. Bohannon is one of the best Bad - Good Guys out there."
B008X0SSDU My hubs loved the HBO series Deadwood. I couldn't get past the gratuitous cursing. Not that I am opposed or without sin-but it was too much. I went on to enjoy its star, Timothy Elophant , in Justified. Cause..cowboy in tight jeans, bad boy vibe. Not the best TV, but something I could watch with hubs. Hell on Wheels is exceptional TV. Yes, it is gory, and there are whores and cursing..but in the amount that likely reflects the time period. There is great character evolvement..and acts of compassion and love that balance the whole tawdry feel. An excellent study of racial tension, hardship, struggle for dominion over the West, and yes, a handsome, (albeit grubby) cowboy in jeans. A win-win for my spouse and me."
B008X0SSDU This is another of my favorite shows Anson is really good in this!! I hope it continues...... a a a a a a"
B008X0SSDU Some interesting events in this season.  Not the best show in the world...but worth a watch if you're in between shows or something."
B008X0SSDU Heart pounding, serious twists, and each character is a top 10.  The Swed is an astounding actor ! Who new when he started as the accountant etc. that he would excel from his evil deeds into so much more!  Music is fabulous! Common and Anson Mount are so interesting but I fell in love with Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott).  Tom Noonan as Reverend Cole was a most believable actor.  I didn't think a lot about Colm Meaney - I kept seeing him in Star Trek. That and he was just so gross in Hell on Wheels. ---oh well you just can't love them all, but this show certainly tries.  I have the 3rd season inked in my calendar for August."
B008X0SSDU This show seems to be channeling the spirit of Deadwood.While this show is not as good as deadwood it definitely tries to capture the spirit of a true to life old-timey western town.I would say that if you enjoyed the first season of Hell on Wheels you will definitely like this season as it is just as good."
B008X0SSDU Not usually a fan of western drama but this series is well written, the characters are well developed and the action is always high octane. Behind it all ..the big questions God, violence, respect etc."
B008X0SSDU I started watching this as recreational research for steampunk stories I plan to write. I got hooked by Anson Mount (ahhhh!) and the many shifting relationships of the characters and their devious schemes and hopes for the future. This reminds me of the old westerns I used to watch as a kid with the dirty stuff put back in--mud, sex, violence, cussing."
B008X0SSDU I love the show and if you want a great television show with cowboys and Indians railroads and the like this is good is they get. One recommendation I have is watch this in high definition, at the time of writing this review though both the DVD a Blu-ray or more expensive than they should be. But with that in mind this show is amazingly beautiful and high-definition. The cinematography is just great and every episode there are one or two scenes that really give you the feelings of being all alone in the Midwest.And I would say this ranks up there as one of my favorite Dramatic shows like Homeland, Mad Men and Dexter.And if you knew the show and have a watch it yet please do as it almost didn't get picked up for season three so it needs more viewers and that's viewers like you! And I think this season is the better season of the two but I think there's a lot of direction that they can go with the show and a lot more stories to tell.Thanks for readingPS Anson Mount is one of my guy crushes I just think he is dirty sexy!"
B008X0SSDU This show seemed interesting at first, but it just became boring after only a few episodes. I think if I still had cable and didn't have to pay per episode, I might watch it when nothing else was on. But at this price, it just isn't worth it to me."
B008X0SSDU My wife and I like Westerns- when Hell on Wheels (HoW) first season came out we watched it and enjoyed it quite a lot and looked forward to the next installment.  We just finished Season 2 and sadly it wasn't as good.  The first 2 episodes were pretty disjointed and it almost seemed like they threw the scripts together as if they didn't know they'd been renewed for another season.  Things come together by the third episode however and got better.  Part of the problem with 10 episode series that have 42 minutes of content- you have to pack a lot into each minute and this leaves plot advancement and character development behind...in other words, you have to pay close attention.  The killing off of more than one major character was also off-putting and disappointing.  All that said, we will likely watch Season 3 on DVD and hope for the best.  Haters who critique the show on it's historical accuracy need to remind themselves that HoW is a drama, not a documentary.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Bohannon exacting some righteous vengeance for the wrongs perpetrated in this outing of the show."
B008X0SSDU Took a chance on Season one (1) and enjoyed it. So I purchased streaming for Season two (2) with an anticipation of it topping Season one (1). Yeah ummmmm.........I was wrong.Anson Mount is a great actor and deliciously handsome (Cullen). He IS the show! But one character can only carry a series for so long.The series promoted (and executed well in Season one) Cullen's drive to exact revenge on the men who raped and murdered his wife and child while he was away fighting as a Confederate Solider in the Civil War. Season two (2) did not touch this tragedy.Season two (2)was the same story over and over with WAY too much emphasizing on Durant (Colm Meaney) .............railroad problems, Indian invasions,someone in a fist fight, hanging out at the Saloon getting drunk, Durant being a PIG morally and in business......SNOOZE.This would of been a good movie or mini-series but they are stretching this to be a \"series\".If they make a Third Season I won't be watching.Big fan of Anson Mount.Small fan of Hell on Wheels."
B008X0SSDU The video quality was very good.We had watched season one, but then the satellite company and AMC had a falling out so we missed the second season.We were happy to find it on Amazon and we got it through Amazon Prime."
B008X0SSDU Good but not as good as season one. Darker character development and not as good as episode endings making you want to watch the next."
B008X0SSDU Definitely a great start to another great season!! Hell on Wheels blew me away last year and has done it again! AMC keep up the good work!!"
B008X0SSDU I am so glad the old west is making a come back, it has great appeal and really is offering some thing for men in a sea of dancing with the stars !  Guns women action love blood violence and friendship great show watch it"
B008X0SSDU I love westerns and this is a good series. I am sure I'll continue on with the series. I season 1 and 2 so I'll be on the lookout for 3. I also liked learning more about the building of the railroad since my ancestors were railroad men."
B008X0SSDU The characters and story lure the viewer from the first show.  It is unlike any western I've ever watched and I'm notparticularly a western fan.  I'm very much looking forward to season 3!"
B008X0SSDU As I hope I was clear when I reviewed HELL ON WHEELS first season, I enjoy the classic Western and even these new-fangled ones wherein the heroes aren't always as heroic as old Hollywood types would have you believe.  Based on circumstances (some of their own creation), these characters don't always do what's right, but they inevitably do what's just for the situations they face.  That might mean picking up a gun and putting it to good use.  It may mean shooting a man dead in order to stop some greater misdeed from occurring.  Whatever the case, HELL ON WHEELS makes great hay in exploring character who, while flawed, have shreds of common decency buried somewhere beneath their dusty exteriors, and they're all willing to ignore them if it gets them what they need.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)When we last saw Cullen Bohannon (played to subtle perfection by Anson Mount), he was on-the-outs with the forces of justice, and he was no longer calling the shots in the rail town of the show's name.  Elam (Common) had been elevated into a more prominent role by Thomas Durant (Colm Meaney), while he and Lily Bell (the lovely Dominique McElligott) pursued their own `union' to see the railroad built.  Of course, that doesn't last long, and Cullen's eventually reinstated into Durant's ranks, but Elam doesn't go quietly into the night.It's difficult to review Season 2 without spoiling some of it, and perhaps the best way to do so would be to explain that - as was often the case in the hard times of the Old West - not everyone makes it out alive.  Forging a nation is risky business; forging a railroad to help build (and re-build) a nation after the Civil War is an even deadlier undertaking.  As such, Season 2 dealt with stories of a more personal nature - Elam trying to find a measure of happiness with the woman in his life, Bohannon and Lily eventually having to take a stand against Durant and his wife (Virginia Madsen, in an underused appearance), the townspeople dealing with more and more racism and bigotry than you can shake a stick at - and the audience is forced to say its goodbye to some of the more noble creations.Methinks the show was quite probably plagued a bit behind-the-scenes with network suggestions and studio tinkering as creators Joe and Tony Gayton were asked to step down as showrunners for Season 3.  (That's rarely a good thing in the land of TV executives.)  Last I'd heard John Shiban was elevated from writer to showrunner, but I believe even he's left the stage for greener pastures as media reports now that John Wirth has been brought in to manage the property for Season 3.I mention this because I tend to believe this tinkering was probably causing these stories to feel \"less connected\" to one another than the Gaytons brought to the small screen in the first season.  Who knows?  Maybe the show was running over budget, and the easiest way to get it back under control is to eliminate some of the headcount ... and there are an amazing number of cast deaths in Season 2.  (Don't forget: I warned you above that there would be some spoilers, but I won't mention any one specifically.)  In the scope of ten short episodes, it's amazing how the program changed from its central emphasis on Bohannon seeking out the men who destroyed his homestead and killed his wife to essentially being \"bottle episodes of the week\" about characters facing the deepest, darkest personal crises.Still, HELL served up some fine moments.  It may've felt more than a bit uneven at times, but the production and performance quality remained high throughout.  I'll tune in for Season 3, if for no other reason than to see what Cullen's up to these days.HELL ON WHEELS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is produced by Entertainment One Television, Nomadic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, American Movie Classics (AMC), Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Entertainment One.  As for the technical specifications, the show looks and sounds remarkable.  And, unlike the first season set, Season 2's comes saddled up with a fair amount of special features: there's a \"Back with a Vengeance: The Making of Season 2\" short, some materials reviewing where Season 1 left off, cast interviews, a set tour with star Anson Mount, and ten short \"Inside the Episode\" mini-documentaries that profile the show's production.RECOMMENDED.  As much as I was surprised and fascinated with HELL ON WHEELS first season, I thought most of the second was a bit of a mixed bag.  Situations seemed to develop less organically (and with less feeling of authenticity), and the characters felt as if they were being tossed about deliberately by a writing crew instead of by the events and circumstances of the period.  The season finale almost smacks of cancellation - fates of the principles were mightily handled out - and I know from following the news reports that AMC dragged their heels for quite some time on a third season renewal.  In fact, I'd imagine Season 3 won't look all that much like the first two seasons given the developments, but perhaps that's a good thing these days.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One provided me with a DVD copy of HELL ON WHEELS: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B008X0SSDU But I would like the writers's of the story line to spend more time on the dialogue interaction between potential couples. There is good intensity and acting, but most moments pass so quickly,  a viewer can turn to reach for something and can miss a key turning point/invitation/commitment, etc., and then one gets lost in the story line."
B008X0SSDU The first season of this show was fantastic, though parts of it were a tad rough around the edges. Season Two nails it, and this locomotive is clearly running on all cylinders.The person in charge of casting for this show is a genius, for every actor is perfect for the role in question, rounding out a wonderfully colorful collection of characters that bring the period to life. Bohannon steals the show in almost every episode (by virtue of his incredible charisma and unique dilemmas), but he is surrounded by interesting, multi-faceted men and women who help make the world feel full and brimming with personality. And in a gesture of true grit, the writers of this show are never afraid to have serious, lasting consequences inflicted upon their major characters. This is much appreciated, for it makes the show feel \"real\", and it also keeps you truly engaged and on the edge of your seat - because nobody is safe.As for the plot itself, the construction of Mr. Durant's railroad to the west continues to be a fascinating epic filled with intrigue, violence, love, and the occasional moment of unfettered triumph and jubilation. Hell on Wheels is, quite simply, one of the best shows I've ever seen."
B008X0SSDU I liked Season 1 a little better...the quest for revenge had more force than the quest to build the railroad.  However, still gritty, good action, interesting characters.  I'll be interested to see Season 3."
B008X0SSDU Bohannon makes a worthwhile, albeit shakey alliance.  As long as it works for either man, it works well.Promoted to boss, Bohannon makes it his goal to take Durant down.  However, Durant, once a poor man has no desire to return to the status of working man.Scenery shots are taken in Alberta, Canada.  It couldn't look more rugged if the sculpted the place themselves."
B008X0SSDU Raw and violent, reflecting the historical building of the transcontinental railroad.  Absorbing and well rounded characters.  Each episode is gripping."
B008X0SSDU I hate to see things end just as soon as I get into it. I didn't like the ending. You have to watch it to understand --- at least they didn't leave anything &#34;hanging.&#34;"
B008X0SSDU This series is fantastic. Awesome acting, and action too! If you like the good westerns, you will like this series.And ladies, the main character is dreamy!!"
B008X0SSDU I bought this for my 22 year old son in college because he didn't have time to watch and wanted to get this season watched before this new season started on Saturday, August 10th.  We all love this show and were so happy it got renewed.  We just watched the third season opener and it was outstanding!  Highly recommend watching this show.  Great writing, acting, direction and filmed in a great location. They try to keep this show realistic and I think they have succeeded.  I have to say, they had one of the most beautiful and well done love/sex scenes I have seen in a long time on television.  I was able to watch it with my 19 year old daughter and she thought it was beautiful. I have no desire to watch porn scenes with my kids in the room.  I usually have to fast forward to the next scene.  We are getting disgusted with the over the top and pornographic sex scenes and it was so nice to see and to show my daughter how it should be done and how beautiful it can be.  Kudos to the writer, director, and the actors for that scene!  Bravo!"
B008X0SSDU This series is unique on television. Season 2 was every bit as good as Season 1, although I was heart broken in the last 10 minutes of the last episode. Glad to see they have worked out the show runner issues, and we will have a Season 3!"
B008X0SSDU I am so glad to be able to watch my show on Amazon.com.  Thanks to DISH I can no longer watch AMC so I had thought I would miss this season.  I set up the auto purchase of the video on Amazon and am able to watch on my Laptop and it is great."
B008X0SSDU Since Walking Dead is one of my favorite shows, that's saying a lot for me. We stumbled across Season 1 on another site as we were looking for something new and good to get into on TV over the holidays. This caught us immediately. Season 1 of Hell on Wheels is another dramatic win for AMC. Season 2, (bought here on Amazon) built on the characters and story of Season 1 bringing us a brilliant look at not only a piece of American history, but in such a way that to a certain extent, you can't hate the Native Americans for their seemingly cruel behavior as their land was being unfairly ripped away from them, and you can't hate the many times corrupt railroad personnel for building a railroad through this land without any thought about the rights of Native Americans.I think the strength of this series is that it shows humanity in all of its forms - greed, corruption, thoughtless killing, drunkenness, as well as moments of incredible love and tenderness. This was a different time. Taking place just after the end of the Civil War, the people \"hired\" to build this railroad are often remnants of this war, many of them suffering from terrible effects and experiences of that war. I would like to have seen more of the Indians side of things, but I suspect this is a series about how the dregs of society as well as some with big dreams of finding success out west all come together and figure out how to get the railroad through Indian territory to the Pacific to tie the east and west together. Hence the name, Hell on Wheels.The huge strength of this series is the actors and writers chosen to tell this story. Ansom Mount is strong as the central character, Cullum. Colm Meaney, is amazing as Thomas Durant, the greedy tycoon trying to get the lucrative government grant to build it. A host of other equally strong actors fill out the story in ways about as genius as the Dead. I highly recommend Hell on Wheels. It's not your average western by any means. It also has a bit of the feel of Sons of Anarchy as well. Definitely in my top ten favorite shows I've seen. Glad I didn't find it sooner. It was awesome watching the first two seasons back to back. This is another win for AMC. It just needs more advertising and word of mouth. Definitely television worth watching."
B008X0SSDU I came upon this series and watched season one and now I am addicted to it, this show is so good and I  would recommend and have recommended this to my friends"
B008X0SSDU It was as good as season 1 ecxcept i dont understand why it diverted attention away from the main story of the show. And Swede was like an evil Barney Fife."
B008X0SSDU I happened to stumble upon this show while browsing my In Demand because their was nothing on TV but reruns. I tried the first show of season 1 and was hooked and have watched every episode since. Looking forward to another season. Great characters."
B008X0SSDU We tried this series on a whim and were glad we did.  Very engaging and entertaining.  We'll keep following this series going forward.  Good price too!"
B008X0SSDU Season 2 was fantastic. Can't wait for season 3. Love this series. Excellent acting by all great story. Season finale was ready good. This show is the best out there"
B008X0SSDU Shame that DISH doesn't carry AMC anymore since I have to buy my episodes to watch them but I'm a big fan of this show. I don't buy the HD as the feed going to my Playstation 3 isn't strong enough to support it but it's still very good on a HD TV. The characters are just as good as the 1st season. Love watching the time period that's being used and there's no holding back on the way things are expressed from that time in the United States. Another show from that period of interst is the BBC America show \"Copper\"."
B008X0SSDU This one is a solid western which is actually as brutal as the old west really was. It was a savage place and this show is similiar to the first one. The actors are all top notch with from tom noonan to the smallest role. the guy who plays the swede is very good as usual too. he's one of canadas better character actors these days!.  This is a really good show and I have had to buy each episode from amazon.com as amc wasn't available on dish when this was on tv. It's a solid show though and in reality the settlement period of the old west was really as brutal as shown in this show. Later families would move into the settlements and things would calm down. But initially settlements in the old west were very much as in this show. The alberta landscape is similiar to the old wests too. A truly solid show in every way , but it's not for kids imo. I like it enough to keep buying the episodes too."
B008X0SSDU I really really love this season of Hell on Wheels as much as the first season. I cannot wait to buy the third season."
B008X0SSDU Keeps with all ep up to this point. Sets,acting and everything about the series is well done. Each one give just enough to keep you coming back."
B008X0SSDU Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly.  Season 2 continues on with Cullen Bohannon and his goal to bring all of the people that murdered his wife and son to justice (HIS justice).  A very enjoyable series with a lot of twists and turns."
B008X0SSDU This is an exciting show that really captures the reality of westward expansion during  the industrial revolution. I've read some reviews that say that hell on wheels is more of a soap opera with brutality as a sub-plot but I disagree. I feel like the show captures the brutal, tragic and ironic reality of the west at that time...I will keep watching as long as they keep producing episodes. This series is anything but a soap opera..."
B008X0SSDU From the very first episode, we were hooked. Had to have the 1st and the 2nd seasons as soon as they were released!"
B008X0SSDU I have watched the complete season one series of this show and I am nearing the end of season two(bummer). Each episode is enthralling."
B008X0SSDU Season 2 is at least as good as Season 1, and I can't wait for Season 3, due out this summer."
B008X0SSDU Good show and we hope they continue with many more seasons-we thought it was going to end after this one but we plan to order the next season we just enjoyed watching."
B008X0SSDU Once you have watched the first seasons, this second season is an instant must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's complicated relationships that is so fun to watch."
B008X0SSDU Loved the Hell on Wheels series.  Personally for me it was a good representation of the good and bad involved in the growth of the American industrial era.  There were some pretty tough people back then!"
B008X0SSDU I have watched every episode released thus far and the series itself and the plots and acting are top quality.  You won't be disappointed."
B008X0SSDU I enjoyed Season 1 but Season 2 is much more exciting. Interesting cast of characters, both good and evil. Common and Anson Mount are both hot as hell."
B008X0SSDU Season 2 met and exceeded my expectations. There were some surprises and a lot of action. I am already anxious for season 3."
B008X0SSDU Outstanding show! All episodes are worth purchasing for all seasons if you have not kept up on this series. Beats watching shows with advertisements attached."
B008XCZ43A Sorry folks.  This may have just been a cultural difference, but.... This was just boring.  Couldn't get through it.  I like sub titles, this one fell short"
B008XCZ43A This film got rave reviews but don't believe any of them, it's just horrendous. You won't get past the first 5 minutes."
B008XCZ43A I remember watching this.  It is off beat; a movie for your head.  If you like independent movies, you'll catch the drift maybe.Ghosts are everyday occurrences and are taken for granted by these people.  If the plot eludes you, you will probably havelots of company."
B008XCZ43A This is a rare sort of film. Its visuals are stunning - including a long trek through a jungle at night and a woman who has intercourse with a water pond. It is metaphysical. As our hero approaches death, he is joined by his dead wife who is visible not only to him but to his younger siblings as well. He is visited also by a son who is now a red-eyed, shaggy-haired beast. Do not expect continuity, just revel in the visuals as they are given to you, and think about it later. This is a truly original film. Watch and enjoy."
B008XCZ43A I have no idea what happened to my life.  Time just got sucked out of me and I have no good an happy feeling, or deep and meaningful reflection, out my wasted time.  I guess I am just not as deep as the people who attend film festivals..."
B008XCZ43A It is difficult to describe this film.  I would call it, as others have, an odd journey worth taking. The spirits of the dead coexist and mingle with the living, and no one seems surprised.To enjoy it, one must allow himself to be submerged in a very different manner of thinking.  After I have watched it, I am still uncertain about the actual order of events.  The story line is sufficiently subtle as to escape comprehension unless one opens his mind.I am glad to have seen it once.  Perhaps seeing it twice might provide a greater insight, but, I am going to stop at one viewing."
B008XCZ43A It could have been good,  but it was too slow and somewhat obvious. I think I could have liked it if I had been in the right mood."
B008XCZ43A To fully appreciate this film, you need a background in, and appreciation for, Buddhism and the eastern concepts of karma, reincarnation, and the transmigration of souls.  I do, and I liked it.  It's very slow-moving, atmospheric, gorgeously photographed, the acting is naturalistic and the dialogue minimal.  It has fantasy princesses, lonely ghosts, red-eyed gorilla-like creatures, randy catfish, bored monks, annoying mosquitoes, bees and honey, and a minimalist plot.  Uncle Boonmee is dying of kidney disease and his city slicker sister and her son come to visit him at his farm to help him out.  That's the premise, but it's so much more than that.My favorite line from the film, as delivered by Boonmee's ghost wife Huay:  \"Heaven is over-rated.  There's nothing there.\"  Something I've always strongly suspected!"
B008XCZ43A A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining.  You're probably not going to actually like this, or glean much from it.  Don't feel guilty.  Just because a movie like this is generally unwatchable and quite impenetrable doesn't make it high art.  I submit that you that this is really just fetishistic weirdness dressed up as sophisticated musing."
B008XFAE8M I love this show. The characters are all very rich and interesting. William Macy and Emmy Rossum are outstanding. You root for them at every turn."
B008XFAE8M Love this show - it's funny, dark, charismatic and gives a whole new perspective on family.  It's provocative natures proves to be both sexy and disturbing all at the same time."
B008XFAE8M The writing is excellent and borders on unbelievable unless you have been part of a dysfunctional family.  This group definitely put the FUN in dysfunctional and the actors are perfectly cast and do a wonderful job with the dialogue and situational comedy/drama scenes."
B008XFAE8M This give a very real look at what many faamilies in America are like..  It's both frightening and up-lifting.  Good"
B008XFAE8M Season Two of the Gallagher clan introduces us to Granny Gallagher, who more than upholds the family tradition of bizarre behavior and brings us a new appreciation of Monica, who becomes less of a running gag and more of a fully developed character that we can relate to. a worthy addition to your collection."
B008XFAE8M NO SPOILERS:When Howard Stern first moved to NBC NY, management tried to control him.  He rebelled.  Then the ratings came out.  Most enlightening was that the people who proclaimed to despise Stern, actually stayed with the show longer than fans.  The reason?  \"Because they wanted to see/hear what happened next!\"Shameless is a cornucopia of taboos that is marketing material for the Christian Right/Family Values Coalition!  Homosexuality, drug and alcohol abuse, child neglect, frequent sex, criminality, etc.Shameless is a dark comedy that is both shocking and funny with enough gratuitous sex and nudity to take the edge off a typical Sunday Night after having spent the lion share of the day watching football.  There are also from time to time some real dramatic moments added to the mix.  However, the main reason why I regularly tune in and have rated this *5 is because I find myself in the position of continually wanting to see \"what happens next.\"The usual comedic fare these days are situation comedies, which while serialized, are often presented in a manner so that they can be watched on a stand-alone basis.  Shameless is constantly evolving, thus to get best viewing experience one should start from the beginning.My highest rating for a dark situational comedy"
B008XFAE8M I adore this program. It took me a couple viewings to get into it and then it's just one big roller coaster ride. Way better than the English version in my humble opinion."
B008XFAE8M I was surprised how much I liked this show. A little raw at times, but a little real as well. I hope it is not accurate about the amount sex that goes on in a given day, or else I was for sure on the outside looking in when I was young. I now have a crush on Laura Slade Wiggins, who seems to be a mix of Lindsay Lohan and Kristen Bell. Wow. And I always love Joan Cusack. 5 stars! Can't wait for the next season."
B008XFAE8M We watched the first season and liked it more and more, no there is no morality in the show , how though you should look at it as a slapstick humor, Not to be taken serious if you do , don't watch it, its like a spoof on a family living in a hard part of town  a family of over 6 or so make ends meet while living life, very entertaining.Not for the prudes of the world, Unique and fesh, though if this type of shows started coming about more often it would be bad entertainment."
B008XFAE8M This is really a great show! William H. Macy has really out done himself and the supporting cast is unbelievable. Not a life you want, but happy to watch it unfold."
B008XFAE8M When I saw the pilot, I thought it would be a dud, but a few episodes and I was hooked. It sounds like an impossible theme to make laughs out of a weirdly functional dysfunctional family, but it works. William H. Macy is incredible as the manipulative, drunk, drugged birth father (it would so so inaccurate to call him the father given his history and behavior). I can hardly wait for season 3."
B008XFAE8M You will love this.Something different with every show, by different I mean, strange or unusual. Definitely worth watching.Entertaining.could not approve of it more."
B008XFAE8M each season is better than the last. and season 2 is good. I watched it in about 2 days. I like it better that way so sit back and enjoy it"
B008XFAE8M It is an additive series.  You have to watch just to see how low the family can sink and shake your head at the next act."
B008XFAZ2C Nice new draw for Gordon Ramsay.  I wonder if it's censored or uncensored.  I think that this being labed \"FOX\", I would think it's censored.  Can someone tell me this before I buy?  Thanks much..."
B008XFAZ2C If you are familiar with Ramsay and his different works, then this will be somewhat familiar to you.  Think kitchen nightmares, but with Hotel's. He goes in, meets the owner/owners and then he tests everything you would want from a Hotel from the customer's point of view. He then chats with staff, people in the town, former and current customers, and then the owners. He then does what he can in a week to turn it around, but mostly just give them, the owners the tools and the direction they need to dig themselves out of the hole they are in. The only thing I would change would be have Gordon go into some of these Hotel's before they are in so far over their head they cant get out no matter what. I would like to see Gordon go in to a place that is in trouble, but with the tools he has left them with, they have a better than average chance of staying open.  Then go back and see how they did.  Other than that, if you like Ramsay, which i do, then you will like this show  to.  In my humble opinion that is.  He is not quite as rough or nasty as he is in kitchen nightmares.  I think that might be because one is food, which is dear to his heart, and the other is a place to stay. He is passionate in what ever he does that is just obvious. It must have been a test season or series.  There were not more than six to eight episodes.  So I would say certainly buy them and watch.  I have seen just about everything he has done.  I'm a big fan and i enjoyed it very much...Michael Cifelli"
B008XFAZ2C There is something about watching stupid or pompous people getting their behinds served to them.  I know it is perverted but I really do love it and Ramsey is a pro!"
B008XFAZ2C For anyone unfamiliar with the service industry, it goes like this:- Bars: very hard, with theft and service issues and inevitable licensing problems with DUIs, etc.- Restaurants: almost impossible, with all of the bar problems and added food quality and profitability challenges.- Hotels: insanely and stupidly unworkable, since they combine the previous two but with a 24/7 attention to minutiae and even worse returns.This show attempts to translate Kitchen Nightmares into hotels but doesn't really work. They redecorate a single room, focus too much on the catering angle and try to boil down the Sinking Owner of The Week into two or three major issues. It doesn't come across as very genuine at all and looks way more over-produced than the restaurant reality shows. It's also pretty dull by comparison."
B008XFAZ2C Just when you think chef Ramsey couldn't do any more, he does. This series was really good.  We like the way he cares about what is happening.  He helps people who almost seem like they don't want help.  He is great at taking on egos since he has a large one.  He did a nice job calling people out and getting them to see what needs to change.  Nicely done Gordon!"
B008XFAZRW I enjoyed this series spin off from The Closer. The ensemble cast worked well together and the abandoned boy side story was nice to see, made them all more human."
B008XFAZRW Still good, but disappointing.  I wish they would not have tried to keep with the &#34;lightbulb&#34; gimmick -- when someone says something and it just &#34;clicks&#34; for them.  Love the cast, though."
B008XFAZRW I really enjoyed The Closer with Kyra Sedgwick.  I thought sure I would miss her terriblly and dislike Mary McDonnell.  I was wrong.  The first season with Major Crimes with Mary McDonnell was very good.  As each episode continued through the season, I grew to like her character much better as she softened a bit with Rusty.  Her defense of her squad also added to her appeal.  Now I am eager to see Major Crimes Season Two.  Really wonderful to continue to have all the characters from The Closer continue in their same characterizations.  G. W. Bailey, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, Phillip P. Keene, Graham Patrick Martin (Rusty) & Jon Tenney.  Great !"
B008XFAZRW I'm a fan of the series, interested in the problem-solving process. Glad it was renewed.  I'll be waiting for itl"
B008XFAZRW While I'm not quite to the point of asking, \"Brenda who?\" yet, this show had a feeling and a spark quite different from The Closer. With this episode, it feels like Major Crimes got a living breathing pulse of its own. It's a different feel although with highly familiar faces.Still, it wouldn't hurt to have one of the characters say at an appropriate time, \"Thank you. Thank you very much,\" with a darling southern drawl...[...][[...]"
B008XFAZRW I've always enjoyed her as an actress and was surprised at her rendition of this detective who seems to have replaced Kyra Sedgwick in what seems to be a new rendition of &#34;Closer.&#34;  I cannot bear to watch her in this so I only watched the first episode."
B008XFAZRW I really liked the angst of this follow up series and was glad they stuck to the continuity with the characters. I enjoy crime drama and this series delivered for me."
B008XFAZRW The closer had interesting characters and villains.  The Major Crime here is that the Closer is over.  I watched the first few major crimes and eventually realized Provenza was now an old woman NOT a cop.  Similar things happened to other characters as they \"freshened\" them and at the same time pretty much destroyed them and their flow.  Too many to count.  One of the most engaging and interesting minor characters Fritz stands around awkwardly making fill in comments trying to tie in The Closer (in Atlanta caring for her father) to the current mess.  The icy professionalism of the former internal affairs person virtually disappeared as they put the awkward story of the \"protected witness' into play to make her seem human.  Instead she is now a fractious and prissy mother figure who can't seem to do her job.Then a gun control meme intrudes on a kidnapping.  The bad guys are gun owners and separatists AND EVIL get it EVIL (EVIL I TELL YOU!) and for anyone who knows anything about real American firearms sales completely unbelievable.  They are every EVIL fly over character possible crammed into a couple of slack jawed cowardly morons.Then in this show they try to validate the UTTERLY FAKE Fast and Furious meme the Administration is so keen to NOW FORGET.  In the show the EVIL (did I remind you they are EVIL?) gun buyers get \"Cases of rifles\" for an unstated purpose. (You remember the idea that guns were being sent to Mexico from the US.  And the idea was so provable the Administration had to fake up a gun running set up of their own to make it true.)  Of course, that the ATF would be all over them immediately for the multiple buys is ignored.  That the gun shop owner is dodgy, cowardly, and corrupt is unstated as he collapses under the immoral authority of the series poor writing.  Lots of things happen and many of them lack any justification other than the plot demands they occur and damn quick of the hour will be over soon.The shows politics STINK to high heaven.I suppose next season they will have Jack Lord come on as a guest (is he dead?  Ah well anyway) and make one of this anti gun diatribes while E Zimballest Jr ((dead too huh...) shows up to blow up cars from 200 yards with his Smith and Wesson Snub nose.The show stinks and so does the writing I am sorry I wasted my money."
B008XFAZRW I had enjoyed the Closer. I have always liked Mary McDonnell. She did a great job in making the transition from antagonist to protagonist."
B008XFAZRW Don't know where to begin.  Story was loose, characters not believable, relationship to boy hooker domineering, and just...wish I hadn't paid the two bucks to see it."
B008XFAZRW Never expected to like this mre than 'the closer' but find that it is both very different from and far better dramatically than its predecessor.  Mary McDonnell is fantastic: master of the soft slow speech that makes you listen...and watch."
B008XFAZRW Great characters and realistic portrayel of the criminal justice system.  Only a small percentage of cases go to trial and about 95% plus cases are resolved by plea bargains.  Also, unlike the closure, which I liked, very few cases are resolved by eliciting confessions.  But the plea bargaining process though not as dramatic as trials can still make for good stores.But speaking of trials, it would be nice to see major crimes unit perform in a trial venue.  I think they will be great.The last episode was the best.  The series ended on a very high note.  I'm hoping the second season keeps up the good work."
B008XFAZRW The Closer was a really great crime drama.  I always liked the way Brenda played down her intelligence and then wiped the floor wtih her advrsary.  The spin off of The Closer to Major Crimes was great idea, but would love to see appearances from time to time by Brenda.  And you gotta love Fritz."
B008XFAZRW This version of the Major Crimes unit seems less adversarial; the writing more focused on how people get a job done. The cast is still marvelous and in some ways the individuals get to shine more. I like it. (I love Mary McDonnell!)"
B008XFAZRW Since The Closer, I enjoyed this show because of the dynamics between the characters. That is what made this show interesting for me. I love watching the episodes over and over."
B008XFAZRW This is an OK series, but there will never be another Kyra Sedywick.  Without Kyra there just isn't the fireworks in the series that I have enjoyed for the past 7 years.  I wish the crew only the best - but I miss Kyra greatly."
B008XFAZRW I have been watching Major Crimes on cable and enjoy it so much I  ordered the first season. I then found out Major Crimes was a continuation of a sort of The Closer so I went back and watched almost all of the seasons of that. Excellent show. Love the characters and the personalities of all the cops in the group . Super Show!!!"
B008XFAZRW Continuing a popular television series such as The Closer with a powerful headliner like Kyra Sedgwick is a tricky risk. But in the case of MAJOR CRIMES that risk was most assuredly worth taking. Even in the final episodes of The Closer the new leader of the police group was introduced and the adjustment by the staff was shared with the viewers - a smart factor in adjusting to a new start.So now Captain Sharon Raydor, portrayed but the cool, assured, soft spoken Mary McDonnell steps in to guide the cast of characters well known and loved by viewers - from the crusty to the feisty and the devoted including G.W. Bailey, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, Phillip P. Keene, Erin Cummings, Samantha Cutaran, Kearran Giovanni, Robert Gossett et al. One character introduced in the final episodes of The Closer as a troubled kid - Rusty Beck (Graham Patrick Martin) - provides not only a sense of continuity that made The Closer so compelling, but his continuing presence as the waif for whom Captain Raydor agrees to provide foster care allows us to see both the tender side of this somewhat enigmatically distant woman while offering some solid psychological coaching for Rusty that shows us more strongly how she will serve in her lead role as head decision maker of her squad.After the first few episodes it looks like a successful series, a fact honoring all who made The Closer a special program. Welcome to Mary McDonnell. The shoes fit pretty well so far. Grady Harp, September 12"
B008XFAZRW This spin off from the Closer I had high hopes for but it left me longing for Kyra Sedgwick.  No one can replace her in this role.  I bought the entire season to try it out and ended up giving up after episode 5.  This series seemed to mostly revolve around Rusty.  The chemistry seemed dead and the magic was gone.  I wish I could get a refund."
B008XFAZRW I have to admit, I was a Closer fan and was so sad when Kyra decided to leave. I didn't think anyone could fill her shoes to make such an interesting character. Well, I am happy to say, that I was right and wrong. Mary McDonnell doesn't fill Kyra's shoes, she came in with a new pair. The show is still funny and exciting and has a big ol' heart as well! Now in season 2, the story with Rusty continues to warm my heart and Sharon continues to demonstrate how a woman can be strong, moral and smart. Shows with strong, female characters are too few and I'm so pleased that we are keeping this one around. I'll be watching it until the end. Way to go Mary!"
B008XFAZRW I could only watch two episodes and couldn't stomach anymore. Sharon Rader making 'deals' for murderers' instead of taking it to the jury, I felt ill. It's too realistic. The legal system always wants to save a buck and the victim has no say in the matter, I should know as it happened to me. But worse yet is David being replaced by Sykes, the butt kisser. This woman is a nightmare! Seriously, they added this dumb woman to the 'elite' squad? She doesn't fit in at all. Just too many changes for the bad rather than the good. I'll stick to my repeat episodes of The Closer and leave this to everyone else who enjoys sub-par television. What a huge mistake they made in the direction of this show!"
B008XFAZRW Since I have all the CLOSURE episodes--had followed Brenda's &#34;adventures&#34;--I wondered how the transition would work.It works.  The old CLOSURE crew has stepped up to take the lead in cases.  Mary McDonnell in her role has becomea facilitator AND incisive thinker.  We saw her in the past as a strong driving woman.  We now have been shown another sideof her--one softer and caring.  VERY nice!  I'm anxious to see more of Major Crimes.  The story lines remain strong andinteresting."
B008XFAZRW I love the complicated and caring relationship between Captain Raydor and Rusty.  Their's is a difficult dance between necessity for his testimony and a bond that gives stability and grounding to both, something that was often missing in the obsessive character of Brenda Lee Johnson in \"The Closer.\"  The accompanying ensemble cast work beautifully under this new leadership paradigm.  We see different dimensions, perhaps more compassionate views, of each character as they learn to work with a different set of priorities, of coloring more \"between the lines.\"  I enjoyed this episode very much for its writing, story arc and authenticity.  No gags or gimmicks, just good story telling.  Bravo to this new old effort - I hope it becomes a successful franchise."
B008XFAZRW Getting the first season and ordering the others as I can allows me to watch the series over and over. I have enough different seasons that I can swap with others and enjoy new and enjoyable entertainment. Always get good product and service from AMAZON!"
B008XFAZRW Love to watch the interactions from these people - pure entertainment, some banter, some smiles, and of course, murders to be solved."
B008XFAZRW Not as interesting as watching Kyra Sedgewick and figuring out what is wrong with her mouth, but the rest of the characters are still entertaining. Plus, who knew she was married to Kevin Bacon?"
B008XFAZRW We have enjoyed the Closer for all their seasons. So when Major Crimes came out, we watched it and loved it... So I Ordered this season so our daughters could follow also. Great Show!"
B008XFAZRW The Closer was my favorite show, so I was glad to see it didn't completely go away.  While I don't find Major Crimes to be up to the standards of The Closer, it seems as though it is beginning to hit its stride.  I like Rusty, and was glad he decided not to meet his father as I would like to see his character remain on the show."
B008XFAZRW How this series grew on us. 4 stars yes but I am a 5 star waiting for the next season.A little adjustment from The Closer transition--Everyone is adjusting!!But oh so worth my time.We Like spending time with this Major Crimes Team-feels so much like real life in their holding back, holding on and then being there.Oh Mary McDonnell- so good to watch and she brings out the best in most!"
B008XFAZRW As I said in a previous review of this series, Major Crimes has the potential to be very good but it hadn't quite reached the right balance of storyline and character interaction.  However, I have to say that this episode, Medical Causes (#3) was finally there!  It stopped dwelling on the 'process' of deal-making and concentrated not only on a fun main storyline but the balance between Provinza, Rayder, Flynn and Rusty was perfectly in sync!  So if you thought that the first two episodes were just a little subpar, you will be happy with this episode because they've pushed it up closer to the level we saw in The Closer.  And even the new female detective is starting to find her place in the unit and is growing on me in the same way the misadventures of Flynn and Provenza eventually did in The Closer."
B008XFAZRW So the new show rolls on, sans Brenda. And we miss her already. The new show has a tough slog, along with the new captain. First show is all about getting respect and building trust, sort of a re-run of  \"The Closer.\" Only this time, we actually know these folks, so the ruffled feathers and personality clashes are more....personal. Still, I think the writers have done a good job and a good launch, I hope the audience stays with it. It continues to be a well-thought and planned crime procedural, mixing in the aforementioned personality clashes and now we get to know the new team dynamic. I still miss the Ho-Ho's, Fritz, (although I understand he'll be back from time-to-time) and the cat.MB"
B008XFAZRW The same group without the Closer 'Brenda' I think lacks big time and falls flat. It's not nearly as fun or interesting as the Closer was. I really miss having Brenda in the series."
B008XFAZRW After watching the Closer (Kyra Sedgewick) for so long, I didn't think the producers could continue on with a successful follow-on show.  But Mary McDonald has stepped up and provided the lead role in another hit which I feel is also due to the original cast being still in place."
B008XFAZRW I started off hating the new Captain and I must admit that it took me the entire season to accept her as a valid character. What really comes through on this show is that it is funny while at the same time, very serious in the topics it covers. I'm looking forward to the next season to see how things work out with this mixed bag of characters."
B008XFAZRW I loved The Closer because it combined realistic events with good writing and humor. Major Crimes follows that formula pretty well. Most of the same characters are present, but there is a little energy lost without Kyra Sedgwick. However, the story lines are good and the characters retain most of their individuality in this series."
B008XFAZRW We do not have cable.  I usually watch this on line the next day, but missed it, so I ordered it downloaded to my Kindle."
B008XFAZRW I was sad to see the Closer end, but this show,\"Major Crimes\" can hold its own and each week it gets better."
B008XFAZRW i did not 'expect' the twist of the female captains role, being challenged by the promoted assistant chief, but if the writing returns to what it was when the program was 'the closer' then a return of the former female deputy chief, Brenda, with a new role and job with the district attorneys office may provide more 'female clout and authority from both departments leading females, which is what I thought would take place when the changes were mentioned in the last season of the 'closer'. time will tell, and I will keep watching."
B008XFAZRW This promises to be as good as The Closer because we have most of the cast still intact, but also have the full time addition of Mary McDonnell, a truly accomplished actress (two time Oscar nominee).  She plays a fascinating character, eccentric, about 55-ish in age so lacking the vanity found in a younger actress, and able to command the men around her who feel they perhaps should have her job.  The two episodes I have seen so far have been great."
B008XFAZRW love this . This has been my new want to see show. Never cared for the Closer, but love this. Mary is top notch  playing this role. Already watched it many times. I am very repetitive .When I like a show I watch it over and over."
B008XFAZRW It was never suppose to be The Closer, The Sequel. Same charcters, for the most part. The actors are still superb and as the first season went along, the writers, actors and directors, found their groove, it improved. I'm looking forward to Season Two."
B008XFAZRW Found it hard to do this... like better than The Closer, hard to accept as I like The Closer so much I have watched all episodes of The Closer several times."
B008XFAZRW Sad to see the season end. Great show! The finale had a great ending. I really enjoyed the family scenario involving Rusty,the Captain and the whole Major Crimes Team.I so look forward to see how Rusty develops and grows into this adoptive family of the Major Crimes Unit. Rusty will have more than just 1 dad (who really cares about him) to give him guidence and direction. The team is really coming together as a TEAM with their new Capt. Raydor. And on another note, I am anxious to see Capt.Raydor go out there and really kick some a**!"
B008XFAZRW Well if we can no longer have The Closer at least we can have the cast with wonderful Mary McDonnell heading it up.  I am so glad that they changed the direction of her character from her first introduction.  It is a wonderful show."
B008XFAZRW the first season was great a spin off of the closers 7 seasons when brenda lee leaves the set and sharon takes over some of the favorites are still there and some of them are what holds it togather"
B008XFAZRW Kept the main cast. Brenda is not here but her husband is. Has a little bit of roughness when it comes to personalities clashing and people have to change their basic characters temporarily but all in all it is enjoyable."
B008XFBQNO Wow, this series just grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It has one theme running through it; these people are in pain and are self-medicating to numb their pain. They all have dysfunctional families and the families are offered help too, because if the addict returns to the family he or she left they will mostly relapse.  It is definitely a family affair, with all contributing to the enabling of the addict/loved family member.I did have to say I had to take a break from the darkness. It usually ends with a happy result and causes much crying on my part, so I had to take a break from the emotional toll it was taking on me. I recommend this one to anyone who want to see a complete turn around from the dark deadly addiction to the clear-eyed happy person at the end. I should give it 5 stars I guess."
B008XFBQNO It's a shame that there are so many addicts that there needs to be a reality show about them. I am forever ashamed at how self absorbed so many of them are!"
B008XFBQNO It follows the same formula of the past 11 seasons and it works its entertaining but mit will soon drain the idea to the point of boring."
B008XFBQNO This show was so good to truly see families and friends trying to save their loved ones and learning how addiction is so powerful it tears apart families and friends. The work they did on this show was awesome.  I will truly miss it.  Maybe they will do some follow up specials.More than worth my time."
B008XFBQNO Some people have extreme highs and lows.  Dennis was a drug dealer, did prison time, etc.  However, he had a loving family and once had a lucrative housing business.  I do wonder if those ups & downs may have led to the drug abuse.Here's what really ate at me.  Dennis' wife waited for him for seven years to leave the pokey.  She was almost sexually attacked by her father-in-law.  In his addiction, Dennis has meth sex with other women, but then punishes his wife for having sex with another man when he was locked up.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!  She was nice enough to stand by you and yet you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater!?  Another thing that irked me was Dennis' daugther drived him around where he scored drugs.  Why does the daughter never think about how she's helping the father to cheat on the mother?  She's like the daughter of Franklin and Eleanor!If you love \"Intervention\" episodes that don't end successfully, then you will enjoy this.  I won't give away the details, but I loved that the family chose to be healthy even if Dennis didn't.  This episode was quite the eye-opener."
B008XFBQNO This is a good program to see what drugs do to good people. Good for kids to see the bad effects of drugs before they are approached. Not suitable for really small children."
B008XFBQNO Great show. Felt bad for the ones who did not take the help. Hoping the ones that did get help are still doing good."
B008XFBQNO I had watched this program from the start and toward the end I was surprised that anyone needing an intervention didn't figure it out but the truth about what happens to FAMILIES is exactly what it is.  AND not all interventions work.  That was the honesty of the program.  Sorry to see it over."
B008XFBQNO It's a good show.  I never watch on tv but watch the prime time seasons offered.  It's realistic and teaches someone more about addiction and co dependency.  Also gives hope to families to see when someone gets help.  They look like night and day.  The transformation of someone clean is awesome to watch.  They need prime time seasons."
B008Y0I0HI This was a great film! If you are looking to forget about your problems and laugh you a** off this is the movie for you! Fun fun fun fun ..."
B008Y0I0HI deff funnier ones out there, but if you're bored and in the mood, go for it... it's not that bad..."
B008Y0I0HI This flick is simply pathetic.  It tries to channel the raunch of \"The Hangover\" movies with the female angst of \"Bridesmaids\" and fails at every turn.  I have nothing against the girls engaging in the kind of horseplay usually reserved for the boys but here it just comes off as juvenile.  It would help if there were some characters you can root for.  This flick attains the unthinkable by making Kirsten Dunst unlikable.  And her character works with pediatric cancer patients!  The usually reliable Isla Fisher comes off not as a smart person playing a dumb character but just plain stupid.  I guess if you were to point to any positives there's kind of a sweet turn by Rebel Wilson as the pleasantly plump bride-to-be.  If you're looking for a girls night out type flick skip this one entirely.  My wife who is less discriminating than me couldn't stand \"Bachelorette\" either."
B008Y0I0HI What a mess. First-time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011's megahitBridesmaidsdoes but frankly doesn't take them far enough to be remotely funny. In fact, I laughed only once during the film's 91-minute running time (it was the line about Michael Jackson). That's too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first-class cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation, leaden pacing, and gags that are overly deliberate in execution. The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together &agrave; laThe Hangoverfor a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend's big wedding. The bride-to-be is Becky, a former geek whom the trio viciously called \"Pig Face\" in high school behind her back. Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least, the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan, the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids. Although resentful of Becky's happiness, she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch, a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky's wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble-headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena. The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party. So many moments ring false including the set-up and the lightning-flash changes in the characters just to service the plot, but at least the cast is game. Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride inMelancholia, Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean-girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness. I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable. Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played inWedding Crashers, Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen's go-for-broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act, Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough-talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant. Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner, while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan's foil. I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells, star of Broadway'sThe Book of Mormon, play Katie's flamboyant co-worker and the party stripper. Rebel Wilson, who played Kristen Wiig's brain-dead roommate inBridesmaids, has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky, though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch. Speaking of which, Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last-ditch effort to deepen the characters. It doesn't really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then. It's no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word-of-mouth will likely sink the film's chances at the box office. At least at home, the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch, a big mistake on my part."
B008Y0I0HI This movie is AWESOME. A total chic flick.Isla Fisher's character is similar to the character she played in Wedding Crashers.I literally laughed so hard my stomach hurt."
B008Y0I0HI This movie has several quality actresses and a promising premise. The trailer suggested a funny movie similar to Bridesmaids, which I loved, so I was really looking forward to watching this. Unfortunately, the jokes fell flat and the characters were catty and unlikeable. The language was foul, the bridesmaids were awful to the bride, and there was cavalier treatment of near-lethal drug use. I just didn't find it funny. I can't recommend this movie at all, but if you are looking for a funny film, I can recommend Bridesmaids."
B008Y0I0HI I do not get the point of this movie. It was not funny or sexy, the soundtrack was ok, but the story-line was depressing. If I had friends like these I wouldn't invite them over for dinner never mind a wedding."
B008Y0I0HI It was ::sad:: chaotic, stupid without sense , total garbage and waste of time , not funny at all , the beginning started well good but then it turn into garbage"
B008Y0I0HI This movie had such great potential. It features a powerhouse cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Rebel Wilson, Isla Fisher, and many other fairly well known actors/comedians. Sadly, the contents of the movie were more dismal than anything.If I had to sum up this movie, I would say it is a combination of the Hangover and American Pie minus the laughs. A pack of girlfriends from high school are reunited when one of them is engaged to be married (Rebel Wilson). Most of the story centers around the hours, and events, leading up to the wedding.The problems I had with this movie are many. First of all, Rebel Wilson, arguably the funniest of the bunch, is absent throughout roughly 90% of the movie. Maybe they should have had her switch roles with one of the other ladies and improvise a bit. Could have helped things ALOT! And I noticed they gave Horatio Sans a credit in the movie on the Amazon listing. He was in it for roughly a minute. It was much more a cameo than anything else.They joke around about doing coke. I'm rarely ever a fan of a movie that shows people using hard drugs, especially when they do not show the repercussions of such actions. This movie pokes fun of it! Truly poor taste!The three main characters are extremely flawed and do not learn from their behaviors. One is addicted to coke, one is a hardcore partier, and the third is a jealous type A personality with body issues. Despite all of their bad decisions and the horrible outcomes, at the end of the movie it isn't clear if any of them learned anything. The only one who might have learned something was the coke addict, but even this seemed unclear. To make matters worse, the hardcore partier almost dies from an overdose and they gloss over this fact. Seriously!? It seemed like the perfect point for her to turn her life around for the better. This movie missed a golden opportunity.Where does that leave this movie? Not funny with hardcore drug usage and characters who do not learn anything from their experience. In my opinion, this makes the movie a definite pass. You won't be missing anything, trust me!"
B008Y0I0HI Laugh out loud many many times kind of funny. I've seen it several times since I rented it bc I need to have friends watch it. Man friends loved it too btw if u need to watch with hubbies or boyfriends. Btw it's available on netflix instant if u have it. If u don't it's totally worth the money to rent"
B008Y0I0HI Being a fan of all these ladies, I was expecting something along the lines of \"Bridesmaids\" with a hint of \"Mean Girls,\" both films I liked.  Unfortunately what I got was a mean spirited, unfunny story about 3 unpleasant and unlikeable women, all of whom are too attractive to be in such a state of despair.Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is the maid of honor for Becky (Rebel Wilson) who no one thought would ever get married.  Certainly not before Regan or her other two gal pals, Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher).  The trio has never outgrown their party days from high school.  In one scene, Gena gets on a plane stoned and gets into a conversation with a seat mate (Horatio Sanz credited as \"Barely Attractive\") about how she manages to give a man felacio on a scale of 4 to 10.  The film is full of raunchy dialog and the ladies lead the way.  This doesn't bother me but I checked out when Gena hooks up with a former boyfriend (Adam Scott).  After the wedding, Clyde (Scott) stands up and rather than toast the new couple, tells everyone how he bedded Gena and went \"in and out, in and out.\"  Really?The middle section of the film is forgettable and hinges on the girls being able to repair the bride's dress that they tore apart while high on coke.  While all this sex talk might make you think, this is going to get better, it doesn't.  All the characters keep their clothes on.  In fact when the boys go out to a strip club the night before the wedding, they don't seem to be concerned at all that the strippers...well... keep their clothes on.  Huh?  Yeah, girls giving lap dances in their dresses.  Where are these places?  I want to be sure to keep my distance."
B008Y0I0HI I went into this movie expecting to watch a flat out comedy, but I got a little more than I excepted. The film is primarily a dark comedy about a group of bridesmaid who accidentally destroy the bride's gown, and frantically try to repair the damage before the wedding. While there are definitely some humorous scenes in the film, its a dark humor and might even be considered a little vulgar to some people. These women are also dealing with a lot of personal tragedy. One is bulimic, one has is addicted to coke, and one has a drinking problem, and those  are only some of the self destructive traits they possess. It was a decent movie and worth watching once, but probably not something I would sit through twice. 3 Stars."
B008Y0I0HI There was some real talent in this movie but the writing and story telling just weren't there. &#34;Bride's Maids&#34; would be a better selection."
B008Y0I0HI liked it  and it had its moments. it was a chick flick and it was reasonable to pay and watch at home since it was still in theaters. saved me the theater ticket price"
B008Y0I0HI Hysterical movie.  Laughed through the entire thing.  Isla Fisher steals the movie and Caplan is simply fabulous.  Kristin Dunst plays a smart, do-it-all, in-charge, dating the right-guy type, modern young woman who is not happy."
B008Y0I0HI Happened upon this on Netflix. Thrilled that I didn't pay money for this - and I can't believe there are actually 5 star reviews here. This movie has no point - is not funny, and I can't believe I watched it until the end. None of the characters are remotely likeable, and the 'bridesmaids' (supposedly friends of the bride?) are horrible to her. Don't waste your time, even if it's free."
B008Y0I0HI Predictable, terrible plot and I just want to slap all the characters except the lady who plays the bride.  I do not recommend it at all and I didn't find it funny."
B008Y0I0HI The story line just does not really work properly. The actors are not doing a bad job, but I spent the entire movie thinking that something was missing to make this work or at least believable. If you have nothing else better to do, I would not call watching this movie a waste of time."
B008Y0I0HI Becky (Rebel Wilson) is getting married to the dismay of her high school friends who believed they would all get married before her. Regan (Kirsten Dunst)is her best friend in the group and is making the arrangements inviting two members of the old gang Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher). Gena and Katie haven't matured and through their misdeeds appear to have ruined the wedding as well as their lives.The film is more of a \"Bridesmaid\" film than the bachelorette party depicted on the cover which was a minor scene. In this film the women use drugs including cocaine. Kudos to Isla Fisher who played perfectly a girl high on coke. Gena is perhaps the biggest tease in the group in her airplane scene. There was a lot of sex talk in the film, much of which was funny. What didn't work was the wedding speech which described the act. WTF was that? Did the script writer die and have a male teen write that nonsense? There were many other scenes which pushed the limits of crudeness.This is for people who like sex comedies.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex. No nudity. Descriptive sex talk."
B008Y0I0HI \"We're going to throw a bachelorette party. We're going to get to dress up and be cool. It's going to be just like prom!\" Every group in high school has the person that joins when no one wants them to. For Regan (Dunst) Becky (Wilson) was the girl in her group. Now years later Becky is getting married and asks Regan to be her maid of honor. Now with the group back together the fun starts. After a joke almost ruins the wedding the girls have one night to make everything better and save the wedding. I have to admit that I did think that this movie was funny but like Bridesmaids it is made much more for women I think. It had that type of humor, pretty raunchy and funny throughout but the humor was more female based. I really liked the movie The Sweetest Thing and this one was close to that but still had more of a chick flick vibe then I was expecting. If you are looking for a good comedy though you could do worse and I would say this is still very much worth seeing, male or female. Overall, very funny but more girlie then I wanted. I give it a B."
B008Y0I0HI Three former high school friends Regan (Kirsten Dunst), Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher) are shocked when they learn that another high school friend of theirs Becky (Rebel Wilson) is getting married. On the day before her wedding, the three girls rip the wedding dress and have to fix it. (But why do they have to fix it? If they are really mean and self-centered, as the film shows, why not hide it and pretend they don't know anything about it?)That the main characters of \"Bachelorette\" are all mean-spirited and selfish didn't bother me. I enjoyed watching \"Carnage\" and to a lesser degree \"Young Adult.\" In making comedies and dramas, you don't have to make your characters sweet or likable as long as they are interesting or funny, and more importantly, believable, to sustain the film's running time. That does not happen in \"Bachelorette.\"The characters are honest to the point of being totally nasty. That is fine, as being nasty is not mutually exclusive to being funny or even attractive. The problem is the story is not only unconvincing, but is uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out. Drug/sex-related jokes are clich&eacute;d. There is some smart dialogue, and the talented cast gives their all, but sometimes it seems writer/director Leslye Headland just doesn't know what she wants them to do.While watching the uneven mid-part of the film, I expected these girls to raise much more hell. That didn't happen. Jokes and crude remarks, themselves alarmingly real, may work as a sketch, but a feature movie needs more than that."
B008Y0I0HI Bitches are funny!The bachelorette was funny.The girls are jelly and the adventure is fool of dirty talk and drugs."
B008ZXSUO2 For me Season 6 was a shade too frenetic and implausible. Which is a shame as the underlying story that ran through the series was excellent. However Season 7 is markedly more accessible and for me represents a return to form for the franchise. Highly recommended. I was left craving more, more, more."
B008ZXSUO2 The first part of Doctor Who Season 7 had me on the edge of my seat. And the end...I just didn't see it coming and every time I see it, it hits me. I love the flirting between the Doctor and River Song. River Song is probably one of my favorite characters now! She's so much fun! Alex Kingston and Matt Smith have great chemistry."
B008ZXSUO2 This series finally gets  you through some of the torn up left over plot lines. Most of it is well written and while there's comedy in the episodes, it neither wallows in drama nor devolves to cheese for the most part. Having seen Matt Smith outside this role, I still feel like the writers/directors have the man on a leash for some reason and I just don't know why. They're wasting his talent by *forcing* him to be &#34;so different&#34; from Tennant's portrayal, which is silly. It makes his acting seem &#34;phoned in&#34; some of the time.  I don't think the audience would have cared one wit if he had mannerisms in common with Tennant...it fact it will probably go down as one of the most missed opportunities ever."
B008ZXSUO2 Here we see the writers following the story line started last year with the Doctor trying to make everyone think he's dead.  From the beginning of this one you can guess what is going to happen.  We know from the 'pre-quel' and everyone interviewed what is going to happen.  Here they begin laying the foundation.  No 'spoilers' here.  Watch and you won't be disappointed."
B008ZXSUO2 First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime, never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked.  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons, many omg what were they thinking moments, but if you twisted your \"head\" just right, it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it).Season 6, enjoyed it, though was getting a might tired with the \"and then there was a paradox... and everyone lived happily ever after\".  Moffat, I've loved his stuff, Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching.  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said...  This season for whatever reason they're doing \"small stories\", that winds up being pretty boring and predictable.  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort), and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks.... Boring.In this specific episode, plot was predictable, their work on having the Doctor being at a \"darker\" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well.  The cyborg in the episode, well, I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again, just not that much fun."
B008ZXSUO2 I loved Season 7, Part One.  The Ponds are at their best.  I thought it was the perfect ending (or should I say beginning) of the Girl Who Waited and The Last Centurion.  I love how over the seasons the Ponds have matured and grown into adults, and the struggles they face with real life and doctor life.  I thought the Ponds Farewell was perfect and heartbreaking all at the same time, and really loved the touching scenes between Amy and her Melody."
B008ZXSUO2 Better than 7.2.  You will watch this because you are a Whovian.  You're still not sure on Matt Smith, you're a little surprised to hear he's already talking about leaving.  But you'll like it well enough.  Plenty of good moments."
B008ZXSUO2 Have followed the Dr. Who series for decades, and am amazed at the difference now and the early days both in acting and special effects. Yet yesterday's shows are still as enjoyable as today's. Was disappointed when Matt Smith replaced David Tennant, but have grown to like his scampise behavior. Of course, the return of the Dalek, his mortal enemies, is always a great show."
B008ZXSUO2 I have been a fan of the Dr for over 30 years. The latest batch was had amazingly high production values. The old B&W ones were the ultimate camp. I kind of miss that. While a liked Tennent a smidge better as the Dr, Smith is good and adds his own charm. The latest story the Christmas one was well written."
B008ZXSUO2 like the movie because they show all the scenes that the show have to cut off because of time, so you are able to get the story better, and i but them , so i can watch as much as i want , and really get the story line. so i love buying the story on amazon and downloading the to my computer and watching them on my roku. doctor who is the best. great show."
B008ZXSUO2 I'm not going to tell you anything at all about the plot, because if anyone had summarized these plots for me, I would have thought they sounded lame and I wouldn't have watched them.  If you are a doctor fan, this may be one of your favorite seasons.  So far, it's one of mine.  It's interesting because I think these writers are probably the British national treasure right now.  Scratch that, they are putting out the best sci fi around right now.  Don't read the previews, seriously, just watch the first episode."
B008ZXSUO2 My daughters love to watch Doctor Who. It is entertaining with clean humor and family friendly. They are looking forward to the new season coming soon."
B008ZXSUO2 This year is trying to top last year and they are exceeding. Each episode is excellent especially the farewell episode to Amy and Rory."
B008ZXSUO2 I love Matt Smith and I was happy to see some more Amy and Rory episodes. Their joint venture comes to an end in this part of Season 7, but not to worry as the next companion is fun and quirky. I really appreciate having the same companion for so many seasons with Matt Smith as Dr. Who. I liked having younger characters for once that were more relate-able. I love all the Doctors, so no preference for Matt Smi
B008ZXSUO2 Even non-Dr Whovian's will love this one! Story is a bit of a tear jerker but it is well written and should scare the panties of the little ones!"
B008ZXSUO2 Great as always, although this season has definite darker plot lines.  I'm very sad to see Matt Smith leave, though, next season."
B008ZXSUO2 Old enemies return and new enemies have also showed.  The daleks learn a new trick, but get their knowledge of dr. who gets erased.  And even more adventures to be had."
B008ZXSUO2 Matt Smith is my doctor.this season was amazing and helped me to learn to love heartbreak. Tears while smiling is what this season taught me."
B008ZXSUO2 This was a very good episode, but a quick one it felt a bit rushed. No spoilers but the ending is a sad one."
B008ZXSUO2 Well done, especially the Mitchell and Webb cyborgs.  But I am missing the adult frisson that RiverSong brought to the group.  Will the Doctor ever grow up?"
B008ZXSUO2 I gave this  five stars due to &#34;The Angels Take Manahattan.  This was a most interesting episode and made the whole season worth watching."
B008ZXSUO2 The series flew by and now we are waiting for part 2 to come out.  The ending is sad, but you knew it was going to happen sometime, I will keep you in suspense as to what though."
B008ZXSUO2 Trust me....by now the series is reaching EPIC on storytelling, twists, turns, and NO WAY blow your mind moments!!! Moffatt has done it again.  He writes the book and Smith reads it to you as a yummy and warped bed time story! I LOVE IT!"
B008ZXSUO2 The Doctor is back once again, how could you not love this series i mean really. It seems Doctor who is the best of a dieing bread of real sci-fi."
B008ZXSUO2 This is my absolute favorite show of all time and I love all the characters and how well they're developed. My husband is astonished because I normally don't get so &#34;into&#34; tv shows, but I've got my Dr. Who background on my phone and ringtones. Haha. You can't help but love each new version of the Doctor and his companions."
B008ZXSUO2 Doctor Who is great! I was not a fan at first but it sucks you in. Never thought a TV show could be so fascinating and aggravating at the same time!"
B008ZXSUO2 Daleks want to Get OFF This Island as they say.  Alas, \"a tsunami [sic] of insane (tee hee) Daleks\" are trying to escape but can't so they not only send bad gingers to kidnap the Ponds and Matt Smith, but they create an ideal of innocence and deserving of rescue in the form of the New Companion which is why Amy is there - for contrast.  There's technically perfect and then there is irreplaceable.The problem with souffles is that they only matter in the minds of twee quarter/mid life crisis expats such as Rachel Khooo and Banana Yoshimoto, Japanese women magazine subscribers et al.  No one CARES about souffles.This is such a horrible, noisome season that this premiere episode is actually the only watchable one of the season and even then the first few minutes with the Daleks pleading for help is the best part.\"eggs-eggs-eggs-eggs EGGS\" is NOT about Chinese egg tarts (my souffles!)This entire episode is like the last ten minutes of Breaking Bad's Ozymandius episode, feigning reformation to salvage/retain/manipulate undeserved salvation for you and/or yours.Allison from Palmdale [HD]2001: A Space Odyssey'"
B008ZXSUO2 Quote from the &#34;western&#34; themed episode: &#34;Anyone that is not an American put down your gun&#34;. I found it funny but this was a clear jab at us Americans. The effects are much better in this season and I really enjoyed most any episode with Daleks. Does have adult themes so not for younger kids."
B008ZXSUO2 Adventure and the realitys of true life come together with a dramatic end for the Ponds and the power of love."
B008ZXSUO2 in it's original run it lost a lot because of the splitting the season intothi is the best way to watch"
B008ZXSUO2 Doctor Who, season 7. enough said. This part 1 of the season leads to even more adventures and exciting revelations of the who Doctor Who family, and the prequel to the 50th anniversary season!"
B008ZXSUO2 Doctor Who is one of those shows that you will never forget. The characters are real. The plot is twisty, fun, and genius. The setting(s) is just the right amount of diverse. I can't wait for the next episodes to come to Prime! I highly recommend this show and this season especially to fans of science fiction and time-travel romance. A very intriguing show that will leave you wanting more!"
B008ZXSUO2 For the dedicated Doctor Who fan, it isn't a matter of whether this is less or more than \"Blink\".  The deliciousness lies in this season's beginning ending with \"The Question That Must Never Be Answered\" - just a sly HINT of where we're going on this year's roller coaster ride with the Doctor. And WHO is there among us who could POSSIBLY resist that?!?The story is amazing.  Touching. Human. And humane. \"Subtract love, add hate.\"  That is the formula that makes a monster of any human. How strong must be the love that keeps us human in the face of our worst fears!\"Asylum of the Daleks\" is a GEM - one of the greatest \"Who's\".  EVER."
B008ZXSUO2 The first set of episodes were full of good old classic doc who fun, sci-fi, villains, and heroes. Must watch."
B008ZXSUO2 i love the continuing adventures of dr who.  i have been a fan for years and love the show, and characters.  and who doesn't love a a firery redhead female lead?"
B008ZXSUO2 I don't know why writers have this overwhelming need to bring down every happy couple. Why can't some of them remain happy? However, it turns out the divorce doesn't really happen and Rory and Amy love each other as much as they always did. Sorry, spoiler.Lots of color, action, bangs and noises as usual. Not much of a plot. The final couple of twists to the story were interesting, I won't add any more spoilers, though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor. But the Matt Smith stories lack the emotional depth and character interest of the David Tennant stories. That's not Matt Smith's fault. It's the fault of the writers."
B008ZXSUO2 The best series on earth.  Dr Who will sweep you away to unbelievable adventures, action packed travels in the future and past and far far away.  Must see!!!!!  A fan for life!!!"
B008ZXSUO2 This purchase has all the greatness you expect from Dr Who but it is missing part of the season...  There is a bonus scene, which takes place at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan, which the BBC aired October 12, 2012. Search the web for Dr Who PS and you can still watch it on the BBC's website."
B008ZXSUO2 Not as tear-jerking as past companion separations, but still moving and effective.  Look away once and those Weeping Angels, well, get nasty."
B008ZXSUO2 This season had it's pluses and minuses. The Ponds were given a perfect send off and the new companion is interesting. The Western episode has been done before but it was nice to see a parent accept the time travling and love it as much as the companions do.  Can't wait to see what happens next."
B008ZXSUO2 So far, so good. I doubt they can top season 6,The Silence are brilliant. But Doctor Who is a GREAT show that should continue for at least another 50 years."
B008ZXSUO2 Didn't think anyone could top Amy Pond but Clara is a winner! Love the good-bye between River and the Doctor. Near broke my heart!"
B008ZXSUO2 What is not to love a Tardis and dinosaurs and fun. Really well written. Enjoyed every episode so far. Waiting to see what's next. I do not mind paying for these episodes I find them worth the price."
B008ZXSUO2 I love all things Doctor, so it is a no brainer.  Matt Smith is not my favorite Doctor (I'm a fan of the last Doctor), but Matt must be endured until the next Doctor arrives."
B008ZXSUO2 I am a Dr Who fan from way back... like I use to watch when I was in my teens... late 60's with Tom Baker as the Doctor (last seen on Monarch of the Glen)... FX have improved greatly and I am in love with Amy Pond (a red-headed Scott)... I am waiting for Part 2 to be Prime!"
B008ZXSUO2 I have been watching Doctor who since the early 1970's and still enjoying each new episode of Doctor Who. Matt Smith adds character to the well known Doctor and is able to play his part well. I hope to continue to enjoy Doctor Who for many more years to come. When I am waiting for a new release of Doctor Who I may play some of the older original series. Both the old and the new series of Doctor Who are very entertaining and enjoyable to watch."
B008ZXSUO2 To be honest, I am a Dr. Who junkie, I have been addicted for many, many years. I have never felt let down by the show and this one is as always, excellent. Action, fun and things to think about."
B008ZXSUO2 As a person who grew up with Tom Baker as Dr. who I can honestly say that this is a great season. I only started watching the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series recently and Matt Smith has been excellent as the Doctor."
B008ZXSUO2 loved the relationship between the 11th Doctor and Amy and Rory - what a great friendship. Last episode was sad!"
B008ZXSUO2 Doctor Who is one of the best sci-fi shows of all time,and this season is no exception. The season seems to be spending more time in the United States, and I'm not sure how I feel about that; Britishness is one of the best things about the Doctor. But its a very British take on the U.S., so I accept it and go along for the ride."
B008ZXSUO2 Not sure what to say without giving to much away. I was really not looking forward to another Dalek story, but this was awesome! The Doctor is so funny in this episode as well. I love the conversation at the very beginning with the mystery lady concerning how much she knows about him. Of course she knows, the Doctor is always going off on and bragging to enemies and the like about who he is and his reputation! I wonder if that was intended to be haha funny or the writers wanted to portrayed the Doctor as serious when asking that question. Also talk about heart breaking and moving! This episode had it all, definitely pulled at my heart strings in a good way. A+++"
B008ZXSUO2 The Power of Three focuses on the bond between the Pond/Williams family and the Doctor. Amy and Rory are questioning the double lives they have traversed since the Doctor arrived and whether or not they should give up time travel. When black cubes descend all over the earth, the Doctor decides to live with his human family to discover the reason for the year-long invasion.For those dedicated Whovians who love Amy and Rory, you may feel a bit weepy watching this episode. There are shout-outs to what has come before - characters and other companions, and a heartfelt confession from the Doctor to Amy that may require a tissue or two.Per the Doctor Who Season 7 production schedule, The Power of Three was the final episode Gillan and Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory. In their last scene together the Ponds got into the TARDIS with the Doctor. And when the doors closed, the three actors embraced and cried."
B008ZXSUO2 While David Tennant might be my favorite Doctor, the creators and actors never fail to generate hit episode after hit episode :-)"
B008ZXSUO2 Have you seen Doctor Who?!?  Because if you have, then you know that this show is fantastic!  Matt Smith is not my favorite Doctor, but this season was just FANTASTIC!  I truly liked him WAY more as a Doctor after watching this season!"
B008ZXSUO2 Don't say \"yes\" to this question just to be nice. Are you really, truly, scared of the Daleks?I know I wasn't about a week ago. I mean, come on. They look like a cross between a children's toy and a salt shaker. Last year's much-maligned episode \"Victory of the Daleks\" diminished their menace even more by painting them in cheerful reds, blues, and yellows. They're historic, they're fun in a nostalgic sort of way, they're even vaguely cute. But scary? Nah...Then came the Asylum. The prison planet for the Daleks who are too insane and hate-filled even for the Daleks themselves.And now, I can honestly say that yes, I am scared of the Daleks.In this story, Steven Moffat has achieved a tremendous success in breathing new life and new terror into a very old Doctor Who monster. He's gone back to the roots of what made the Daleks scary in the first place, and even \"rebooted\" some aspects of their mythology. (You'll understand it better when you watch the episode.) For the first time, I'm really looking forward to the next Dalek episode. Also, there's an amazingly well-kept secret in this story, a surprise which will be a delight to anyone who's been watching news from the Whoniverse closely over the last couple of months. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" is probably the best Doctor Who episode we've had since \"The Doctor's Wife\". Make no mistake - you will never see the Daleks the same way again after you watch this."
B008ZXSUO2 I think I can say I'm a BIG Doctor Who fan, but this new season of the Doctor is not as good as I hoped.  When we were first introduced to Matt Smith it was so fun! But season 6 brought some hits and misses. So I guess I might be expecting too much for this season, but I know Steve is doing a bang up job.  I just hope when it comes back in the winter and spring it will be phenominal. Just a little request;)!"
B008ZXSUO2 This show is great.  Plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested, creepy enough to make you look over your shoulder but not enough to keep you up at night.  I love all the doctors!"
B008ZXSUO2 I am an old Doctor Who fan from way back and the new Doctor Who is the best. Last season the Doctor had to fake his death, but this season he is back with Amy and Rory. Things are not going well but they all work together to solve a series of serious problems. Back and strong as ever in the \"helping humanity\" department the Doctor still has it this season. Come and watch!"
B008ZXSUO2 The setup sounds quite bland, but they explore the ethics of war and experimentation quite well in this episode. It never quite reaches that true western feel, but it is a solid episode nonetheless."
B008ZXSUO2 This episode was a wonderful blend of humor , action and angst, which is just how I love an episode to be!"
B008ZXSUO2 SPOILER:  Finally the overworked Pond companion is finally written off.  Steven Moffit again wrote another bad story, but it does not matter because the most irritating and annoying of companions ever conceived for Doctor Who is gone.  He at least was able to do that, but again in a very predictable way.  I hope the new British female model they hired as the next companion can actually bring some talent and creative interest to a sadly fading storyline, which gets worse each episode, starting from the beginning of last season.As I stated in my first review of this season, (just after the first episode) the Doctor Who saga is in desperate need of an injection of unpredictable story lines and crafty inventiveness, which Doctor Who used to be infamous for. The writer for the past few seasons refuses to bring anything fresh... this of course means no new creatures, new planets and worlds to a 50 year running saga, which is my favorite SI-FI of all time.  I do appreciate that the BBC keeps on releasing older episodes, from last century, back again in DVD and remastered. For those of you who only got into Doctor who since 2005, you would do well for yourself in investing time into the previous adventures since they truly mirror the genius behind the reason why the legend of the Doctor has lasted so long on television, and not just in England, but everywhere around the world.It is just so disparaging that the worst writer ever of this show, is getting cart blanche in making all of the new episodes (not fresh, just new) and dragging the franchise down with his predictable, repetitive and boring style of writing, which disgraces the great name of the series.  Instead of another female British model as a companion I really wish they could bring about a real person we all can identify with, like a Donna Noble, who (in my opinion) should have been kept on as long as boring Amy Pond did during her OVERLY long run on the show.  It would, at the very least, have been more fun and more entertaining, because for one thing, she can believably act.Anyway, cross your fingers and hope with me that the rest of the season and seasons (hopefully to come) will improve now that there has been a cast change.Thanks for reading my review."
B008ZXSUO2 I will start by saying I am a huge DR WHO fan and although I think the episode had a wonderful script, it felt incredibly rushed.  There were a few timing elements which rushed us past some of the more poignant moments we find in the best Dr. Who episodes (especially those involving Davies who is sadly not part of Dr. Who these days) and took us from a stellar 5 star rating down to a meager 4.  We know the actors can act because they have been brilliant before and I have been a fan of Rupert Graves since I saw him in 'Maurice' ages ago (and I enjoy him on Moffat's 'Sherlock' series), but all their pacing was too fast and this has to be the fault of the director.About the episode itself, it is filled with typically Whovian quirkiness and the action is there, but again, if you are a fan of Dr. Who for the moments of humanity which shine through as much by the acting as the script, they are jammed into the action and lose their edge.There was one tragic moment that I will not spoil by mentioning that almost got at my heartstrings--it was certainly surprising and not pleasant, but the director managed to move us past it without any real tenderness (time may have been allotted to this pivotal scene but the acting was some of the least tender I've seen for such moments which has to be the director's fault again).My favorite line which I hope isn't a spoiler comes when Queen Nef asks Amy if she is a queen.  Amy's response made me laugh.All in all, if you are a Dr. Who fan, this is still a fun episode but it falls a tad flat in the 'humanity' of the characters department."
B008ZXSUO2 A good, solid, episode with a bit of humor and a few thrills. There's none of the sheer terror you'd find in a Weeping Angels episode, or the nightmarish horror of \"Asylum of the Dalek.\" Sure, there's always an element of alien terror, but nothing that the Doctor can't handle. There's a lot on what the Ponds have been up to lately, more on Rory's father, the introduction of the daughter of a character from the old series, and a few other surprises. Telling any more would be, well, telling, and if you haven't seen this one I don't want to spoil it for you. I'd say this is my second or third favorite of the season so far."
B008ZXSUO2 While it isn't better than the 5th season, it certainly has all the ingredients of a great Dr. Who series.  Matt Smith continues to portray an exciting and energetic Dr and the writers continue creating edge of your seat episodes.  I cannot wait until the second half of season 7."
B008ZXSUO2 I am a true Doctor Who fan and a true science fiction fan, so I am used to a lot of fantasy.  But there is a point where it is too much.  I only watched the first two episodes.  I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason.  I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who's.  Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like."
B008ZXSUO2 I love this, the quality is  rather good, the season so far is great.  Downloads ok, I havent tried to put it on a device yet I am just streaming it."
B008ZXSUO2 This episode did not miss its mark in any way.  Well worth the long wait, however painful it was.  I loved seeing Rory and Amy again, and can't believe that we don't get a whole season with them. Also, loved the saucy new character -- she was a hoot!Well, can't write more without spoiling it, so I won't.  Geronimo!"
B008ZXSUO2 sad to see the end of Amy and Rory, but Asylum of the Daleks is a pretty fun romp. The introduction of Rory's dad as a foil in Dinosaurs on a Spacechip and the Power of Three was nice. A true outsider's view of the proceedings was nice, and seeing Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart's daughter carrying on the family business of UNIT was fun."
B008ZXSUO2 We love them all, the only down side is they did not release the whole season (not an amazon problem).  If you are a Dr. WHo fan you will not be disappointed."
B008ZXSUO2 OK, I'm a Dr. Who fan and have watched is for years. I had a bit of a problem converting from David Tennant to Matt Smith but it's fine now. Matt actually does quite a good job. If you like &#34;tounge in cheek&#34; SyFy you will like it too. I plan to continue watching it for years in the future."
B008ZXSUO2 I am unable to get BBC network so was very excited to be able to pre-purchase this. I am a big fan. Even knowing what is to come (Amy and Rory) I eagerly await each email message stating a new episode is in my library. It's such a kick in the pants to see British TV shows recorded here in the USA. Really good to see Ben Browder in this episode. Enjoyable SciFi is hard to find with this level of humor."
B008ZXSUO2 Just as good as the rest of the seasons. If you are a fan theis season will not let you down."
B008ZXSUO2 Matt Smith really shines this season as he seems to hit his stride. Fun episodes with the Daleks and weeping angels with some fun romps with dinosaurs in between."
B008ZXSUO2 The first and second part of season 7 are great and I can't wait to see the next ones made."
B008ZXSUO2 Time travel has always fascinated me.  I love the plot and the countryside.I have watched this twice over.  Marvelous."
B008ZXSUO2 I have followed the Doc since Pertwee, feeling that Tom Baker was my favorite.  This new guy is interesting, still flippant, and solved this program's quandary with a leap back in time.  Hasn't got a companion yet, but you know he will."
B008ZXSUO2 Matt Smith is superb in the role as The Doctor, everyone's favorite Timelord.  He, as an actor, plays the role quite well and makes the character feel real.  The stories are amazing and the special effects are top notch, right up there with Star Trek or Star Wars."
B008ZXSUO2 As a long-time Whovian (early 80's to be exact), I don't think I'm being overly hasty when I say I'm just not feeling Doctor Who these days.  Yes, It's by far the best written, best filmed, best acted science fiction currently being produced on planet Earth in the early 21st century but it's just become so...sentimental.Weeping Angels - one of the creepiest and creative alien threats television has seen since the Borg, but The Angels Take Manhattan's excellent premise becomes a weepy, heart-on-your-sleeve farewell to the Doctor's resident couple and a hello to the return of the annoying and not-so-sexy (although the writers do their utmost to convince us of the latter) River Song.  Seriously, when this episode was premiering on BBC America I came so close to changing the channel during the musical, team-suicide interlude and subsequent ultra-weepy Amy farewell and I have rarely felt that way about this series since the latter years of the original.  Loved the addition of Mark Williams (a.k.a. Mr. Weasley) as Rory's father but again the super-sentimental cube episode where the focus was so much on a domesticated doctor and the conflicted Rory and Amy that even the introduction of Lethbridge Stewarts daughter couldn't alleviate my deepening revulsion.  Asylum of the Daleks, on the other hand, was 
B008ZXSUO2 This was a particularly good episode. However, the plot is a bit tedious...its the same old recycled alien plot where the aliens think humans are a curse on the galaxy and need to be eradicated. But its still awesome"
B008ZXSUO2 Did not like this episode at first because it seemed all to predictable but it sure ended with a bang. :D Looking forward to seeing more like it."
B008ZXSUO2 This is an ad for the upcoming season. As an ad it does not really work for me since I see nothing new in the up coming season to make me want to pay for the next few episodes. I like the Dr but I am going to wait 6 months for it to show on Netflix. Also, charging me 99cents for three minutes has made me an angry viewer. Only for the new Canadian Primeval would I pay that......rip off!"
B008ZXSUO2 Doctor who visits the dalek planet to save the dalek?Well the adventure continues.This ep has all the classic doctor feel"
B008ZXSUO2 This show just gets better and better.  The entire family loves Doctor Who just as I did twenty years ago.  Rock on BBC!!"
B008ZXSW2C As prompted, &#34;it's okay&#34; but I strongly suspect Season 1 will be enough for me."
B008ZXSW2C I wasn't sure I would like this show but I haven't stopped laughing and watched the entire season in one day! Totally charming and fresh! The actors are great and super funny!"
B008ZXSW2C Its hip, new age  writing or just lazy writing really a matter of perspective.  Her character is smart and open minded and understainding of just about anyone, which makes her comical when she tries to fit in with everyone. She is unsure of the adult she is because she equally shares her idealism with everyone therefore not having a full grasp of who she really is.  Others may say her as open minded and welcoming.  I've seen a couple of episodes may watch another one."
B008ZXSW2C This show is so good I have to give it 5 stars.  I love how vulnerable and believable the characters are- with all of their imperfections.  It's refreshing to see a show where different background and body types are represented- much like the real world where not everyone is a size 0.  In addition, the chemistry between he cast is great, they are a very funny and witty bunch.  LOVED the most recent episode where Mindy had her Christmas party in her apartment.  It had a really good ending."
B008ZXSW2C The Mindy Project is a \"comedy\" I don't find it funny when a successful doctor acts like an insecurity teenager.  \"Mindy\" may have graduated medical school and practices medicine but is a \"project\" because she isn't in a relationship. This show sends a horrible message to young women."
B008ZXSW2C there's funnier shows out there, but if you're in the mood for a laugh, you'll find some here. it's decent."
B008ZXSW2C Have just seen the pilot, but this show looks like a keeper. It's a sitcom that's not stupid about people who are not stupid with writing that is far better than stupid. It's a different and original take on what could have been another factory retread. Mindy Kaling is both charming and very funny - although a bit too beautiful for her lack of romantic success. Based on one watching, I am going to guess that a trend toward the other characters having depth will continue. The only drawback is that you have to watch actively or you miss things - actually, that makes re-watching more of a pleasure. All in all a very good start to what may become an outstanding show."
B008ZXSW2C I have loved Mindy Kaling since the first season of &#34;The Office&#34;. She is a wonderfully snarky, off beat writer. Her supporting characters seem to have a hard time finding themselves...but maybe that's the growing pains of a new show. Mindy is WAY too out there to be taken seriously as a dr of any kind, but it's a comedy, so I kind of let that slide. I adore Morgan the nurse and Dr Danny. Bring back Shauna, tho! Miss her! The addition/ subtraction of so many new characters can be annoying, and Mindy's constant search for a guy bothers me a little..but again, it's a show, not real life. She's really always very funny, and frech and as I watch only 2 TV per week, I don't have a lot to compare this show to. Hope it sticks around."
B008ZXSW2C I couldn't believe how funny, sexy, and out there this series turn out to be. 16 and under need not apply. Yes I watched season 2."
B008ZXSW2C Mindy is to be commended for having enough sense to finally leave The Office. She should also be among the first against the wall when the artisan revolution rolls around. This show offers nothing new, no unique viewpoints, no relevant voice, and is 
B008ZXSW2C Dr. Mindy Lahiri (Mindy Kaling) is an OBGYN working in a New York City practice with Drs. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina) and Jeremy Reed (Ed Weeks). Despite the level she's reached as a professional, somehow Mindy always seems to have problems getting her personal life together. Part of it, she's quick to admit herself, is that she loves sappy romantic movies like Sleepless in Seattle and desperately wants her real life to be just like them. Then, of course, there's the fact that she's quick to fall in love, and some of the guys she meets just aren't what they seem at first.Luckily (?) Mindy has her colleague Danny around to remind her of her shortcomings -- and, just as often, to provide real advice and a shoulder for her to cry on. Although they would never admit it, Mindy and Danny are true friends, always there for one another. Is it possible that friendship might eventually lead to something more?Although Season 1 is altogether satisfying, introducing a number of funny and oddball characters and scenarios, it does take a while for the show to find its groove. For instance, we meet Mindy's longtime best friend Gwen (Anna Camp), as well as a number of her other girlfriends -- who are mysteriously absent by the end of the season and never again mentioned in Season 2. Likewise, receptionist Shauna (Amanda Setton) disappears in this season, and in the next, viewers meet the sassy nurse Tamra (Xosha Roquemore) in her stead.As Kaling not only stars, but produces and writes this show, it's no surprise that the first season alone sees a number of guest appearances by her former co-stars from The Office. B.J. Novak appears several times as Jamie, a potential love interest for Mindy; and Ellie Kemper plays Heather, a jealous ex-girlfriend with a bit of a violent streak.Overall, The Mindy Project is funny AND fun -- a half hour full of witty dialogue and amusing situations. As the seasons progress, there's certainly room to grow, but then, who among us doesn't? Give this show a try -- you're guaranteed to be hooked in no time!"
B008ZXSW2C It's refreshing and great. I like the characters. Mindy is really the star of the show and is very talented."
B008ZXSW2C I've loved Mindy Kaling since she was on The Office. I was excited to find The Mindy Project, and was hooked after episode 1. I'm hoping this show gets the attention it deserves and has many seasons!"
B008ZXSW2C I find I can't stop laughing when I watch this. I particularly like watching it late at night as the end of each episode reminds me it's time to turn out the lights. Not that I always pay attention..."
B008ZXSW2C When I caught bit of her show on TV, I didn't get it.I never really liked her character on The Office either.Once I started watching the DVD from the first episode, I fell in love with Mindy and the entire cast.Nobody was shocked about that fact more than I but oh what a joy!  What a find!Ike Barinholtz is someone I did not like when I saw him on TV years ago.Well now I LOVE his character and his acting on this show.I love every single cast member, even Beverly.Whoever cast this show, who ever wrote an episode or directed, pat yourselves on the back.Bravo!I love love this show.  What a gem!"
B008ZXSW2C Love this show!  We had to get a new DVR and lost 5 episodes we missed.  We finally found them on Amazon."
B008ZXSW2C Despite how many people dislike her, I actually like Mindy Kaling. She has a quirky enough charm to her, where she's worth watching. And unlike her Office character of Kelly Kapoor, in real life, she's actually pretty smart, despite her ditzy voice. So, all of her more real life magic and charm was expected for her breakout series, \"The Mindy Project\" (which came about from \"Untitled Mindy Kaling Project\", meaning this show really doesn't even have a real name, to it).And while Mindy's chick-flick charm, mixed in with small flashes of intelligence or competence does work here, she simply isn't enough to hold an entire show. While her best friend and Office co-star, BJ Novak is also working on this show with her, and she has some backup in the form of NBC buddy cameos, like Seth Meyers and Ed Helms, the fact of the matter is, none of the rest of the show is good: Her believability as a doctor (unless you were to get racist and assume it's because she's Indian), her insufferable and BORING supporting cast, and her premise of being an adorkable girl starring in her own self-imposed \"life as a romantic comedy.\"The show is supposed to be a companion show to \"New Girl,\" but at least 'New Girl' has it's niche: It's a girly comedy with enough manpower and masculinity in the form of her support cast roommates that it balances itself out for all audiences between 16 and 30. However, \"The Mindy Project\" doesn't have any of this, and it's only real audience seems to be girls ditzy enough to be into Kate Hudson movies, like Mindy Kaling/her character, herself. There is no real audience appeal, because not all women in their late 20's/early 30's are like Mindy, and honestly, there's no real reason for men to watch, at all. The show isn't funny enough to break any demographic barriers, either. It's mostly not funny, at all. Add in NO likable or interesting support characters, and a boring career premise with Mindy as a 'stupid, yet smart' doctor, and it's ju
B008ZXSW2C Can't wait for Season 2.  Seriously.....can't wait.  All the characters are funny and the writing is smart.  I laugh out loud regularly."
B008ZXSW2C The cast is believable, the acting is excellent.  I dislike the easy hook-up culture portrayed.  As an observant Jewish woman, I'm dismayed at the casual sex.  I do like the relationships, and generally that Mindy is kind, funny, assertive.  I do think she sets herself up for being hurt by asking that midwife, for example, to 'hookup' with her."
B008ZXSW2C Mostly love. She is way too self-deprecating, though, which gets really tiresome; and there is lot of negative humor about older women, so don't watch it with your mom. :( Which is sadzers, because she'd love Mindy, if Mindy had a filter.So.... I mostly like it, but she kind of goes for the easy shot. I LOVE the guy who plays the medical assistant that did time in prison! He makes the show. LOL!"
B008ZXSW2C Its sweet endearing and funny. Mindys brand of adora-quirk is even better now than on The Office, where I loved her character.  Theres a cute token British guy, and Chris Messina is super hot in this show as Danny."
B008ZXSW2C The Mindy Project is a superior show in all regards. It is with the times, has a great cast, and most importantly it is FUNNY. The jokes are smart - they don't expect you to reduce your humor level to below a knock knock joke like so many sitcoms these days. Mindy is such a cool character and I totally identify with her - she's in her 30's and so am I. Her character doesn't seem like a character - it seems like a friend you would have. This show is very well written and reminds me of Scrubs in a way - yet it is definitely unique. The Mindy Project is a must watch!!!"
B008ZXSW2C This was cute, and funny, and smarter than I'd expected.  I hope the premise of the show--that she improves her life--holds over romantic entanglements.  Kelly is a likable character."
B008ZXSW2C if your interested in watching a woman whine like a little kid this might be the show for you.  I think my wife likes to watch it just to enjoy someone else go through pain."
B008ZXT2LM I got this for my daughter when she was 2 months old. She is now 5 months and in love with Dinosaur Train. :) Thanks I love the educational knowledge."
B008ZXT2LM Dinosaur Train is such a great show and my 2 yr olds love it. The characters are friendly and loveable which makes the kids pay attention. Their adventures are always fun and they learn a little about dinosaurs along they way!!"
B008ZXT2LM I love how much my daughter and family learn about different prehistoric creatures!  That's not the only skills we learn that are modeled for us on the show.  I love that the family dynamics model common challenging situations and helpful solutions that can be applied in my family.  The show is also colorful and simply lovely to watch.  This is one of my favorite PBS shows.  Enjoy!"
B008ZXT2LM \"Train\" as my granddaughter calls it will get a 5 star all the time, it is entertaining to us both and has a layed back theme."
B008ZXT2LM I have seen way too much of this show lately, but my little guy seems to really like it.It's educational and provides a lot of information about dinosaur which my 2 year old loves so it does it's job.My only thoughts are the episodes are a little short, 2 in 1 is pretty quick so sometimes it feels rushed, b
B00905RRNE Good Show. Good Learning experience. What these people endure to find gold is unbelievable. There is one barge with an excavator mounted on the bow and this scoops up some serious dirt containing some serious gold. Hundreds of ounces."
B00905RRNE I choose this rating of 5 stars because this is worth it.There is nothing to dislike about this Show.I would highly recommend watching the Whole Season 1,2,3 etc... It is worth the price!!!"
B00905RRNE I enjoyed watching this show. Seems like the producers thought that they should limit filming of vacuuming gravel and sorting for gold. Actually that's the best part. To replace the filming of actual gold mining, they created false issues and fake fights. I didn't care for the fake drama. I wanted to see more of the mining and the gold."
B00905RRNE These people take some very high risks just on the hope of striking it rich. I think I'd rather get a job at McDonald's than put up with the risks and freezing weather."
B00905RRNE Is great , if you like Discovery Channel.If you have a TV or BOX compatible with Amazon Instant Video, will be great.Saw in the pc is not the same.But if you are in vacation outside of US , please NO ip detection for IPad and Android. ( this is a message to Amazon )"
B0090EJZA8 Film has been the only media for making movies until the advent of digital video recording.  This documentary delves into the technical differences, explains how digital recording has advanced in recent years, and interviews famous directors for their personal opinions.  I wonder how long the term &#34;filmmaking&#34; will last once the transition to digital is complete?  We still talk of &#34;taping&#34; a TV program, even though most of us use a DVR.This is a must-see for every film buff...er, make that movie buff."
B0090EJZA8 I'm a fan of documentaries I try and watch one or two a month. And I heard about this on a website and I'm somebody who likes films (and digital filmmaking) and this movie was great. You get a really neat look at what goes into making movies and what went into making all the movies we grew up loving. I really think if your student of film this is a must watch movie but even people who just love movies will benefit from watching.I think Keanu Reeves does a decent job as the narrator/interviewer throughout the film (charting the growth and recession of his facial hair was kind of distracting) but you can tell he loves the medium and this topic. And his guests also equally love their jobs and you can tell by their passion for the subject matter.One thing I really enjoyed about this movie coming from somebody who just enjoys good movies, you will find a lot of movies you've never seen that are really awesome. Throughout the movie are introduced to examples of old cinema that is the pinnacle example of the art and style of the craft. And interestingly enough a lot of the movies shown as examples of the greatness of cinema I was not familiar with. So now I get to expand my movie knowledge and add to my catalog of movies that really transformed Hollywood.Definitely a must-see for anybody who likes documentaries and anybody who likes the art of filmmaking.Thanks for reading my crippled scribbles!"
B0090EJZA8 If you're interested in film and film history this documentary is well worth watching.  We're in the middle of a digital revolution when it comes to film making, and this movie provides a lot of insight into the changes that have been taking place and gives some nice history behind these changes.All the commentary is from people in the business and it runs the gamut from loving and hating digital film production.  The bottom line is that digital is here to stay and will continue to evolve and change (as it always has).The one thing that is certain is that this digital revolution is profoundly changing the industry, which hits close to home for me, as I've got family members that work in this field whose skills have been rendered obsolete.Digital is changing every aspect of our society, and entire industries from publishing, music, medicine, and film, are trying to adapt.  This is a look into one specific industry, one that we're all exposed to in one form our another, making this a fascinating film to watch."
B0090EJZA8 I admit I'm more a fan of film than digital and always try to watch movies on FILM, instead of digital presentation, whenever possible. I've watched only part of \"Side by Side\" and am quite looking forward to watching the entire presentation and any bonus material. It's quite awakening to hear from the experts you do know AND many you don't! I am already a little less opposed to digital after learning some of the ins and outs of the movie business, but still believe film is the ultimate way to go. Side by Side is not as technical as I expected, but has the details for those who are film/digital savvy, so I would recommend this feature for almost anyone."
B0090EJZA8 It was not what I expected and narration was boring. I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over."
B0090EJZA8 Interviews with the best directors in the movie business about using computer graphics in the movies. How these directors used computer graphics in there blockbuster movies, very informative. I give it 4 Stars."
B0090EJZA8 wow, a lot of opinions and a lot of insight into the development of digital media and the pros and cons vs. film media.  just a great documentary that dives into the issue with some fantastic cinematographers (DPs) and directors. emulsions vs. picture elements (pixels)"
B0090EJZA8 While the commentaries regarding the &#34;film vs. digital&#34; debates were informative, the use of Keanu Reeves left me with a &#34;kinda OK&#34; attitude. I did expect better."
B0090EJZA8 It ultimately fails to deliver on the pretext of the \"The Future of Digital Film\" since it's really an analysis of the history and current state of film production. That aside, it's absolutely fascinating to hear from a dozen or so very big names about their thoughts on the subject of digital versus celluloid. I even thought Keanu Reeves was much better as an interviewer than I expected.The digital notables are there - James Cameron, George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez - to promote the digital revolution but actually all of them make some extremely insightful comments. Whatever you think of George Lucas, you have to admit that the man has the finger on the technology pulse in movies and his opinions are almost prophetic in this regard. When pressed about the 'unreality' of digital processing, James Cameron gave an awesome response along of the lines of \"How was anything in the movies ever real? The raining downtown midnight New York scene was shot in daytime Burbank with a rain machine and 30 people in the background\". Rodriguez, whom I was lucky enough to meet at RISE Austin this year, sees digital as an enabling tool - and this is from a man that shot a feature film for $15K so if you enjoy movies, you must listen to the guy.There's a good balance from film purists too, and I was surprised to see Chris Nolan in the celluloid camp. There are some valid criticisms of digital filming and processing but the documentary leans towards suggesting that the chemical method of the past is really coming to an end. Some of the newer professional movie cameras are shown and it's fascinating to hear the DPs talking about their pros and cons historically.This is definitely a big hit for film fans who love the technical stuff though not so much for the rest (my wife fell asleep). Personally I'd love to see more industry topics covered in this format since almost everything that's a DVD extra is basically:- Actors saying nice things about each other and the director- Green screen magic without showing any post-production whatsoever- Plugging the next installment or merchandiseAfter watching the whole thing, it's pretty clear that since sound and editing went digital years ago, the camera is going to follow the same path and you'll be telling your grand-kids about how actual film worked."
B0090EJZA8 I'm crazy about the movies and could talk about different aspects of the film world for hours upon hours. So any serious contemplation about the art of filmmaking has an inherent interest for me. But beyond that, \"Side by Side\" assembles some of the biggest names imaginable to discuss the digital revolution currently underway. Producer and host Keanu Reeves interviews such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Soderbergh, David Lynch, David Fincher, and James Cameron for this piece. And while these are some of the biggest names (those featured prominently on the DVD/Blu-ray cover), there are plenty of other familiar faces willing to weigh in as well. With lessons in film history and film technology, the documentary is also a stunning retrospective of movies that will have you yearning to revisit many of your favorites (often with a new eye). Seriously, you should get a film school credit for watching this presentation! This is no dry lecture, however, but more like a lively and informal debate.Celluloid has been the exclusive medium for movies for over a hundred years. Recently, though, advances in digital technology have changed the game. \"Side by Side\" charts the evolution of the technology using lots of examples and film clips to highlight the historical stages of digital filmmaking. Once the province of low budget student films or experimental works, it now accounts for a large portion of the entertainment shown in modern movie theaters. Does this trend mean the end of film as we know it? This is the big question at the heart of \"Side by Side.\" Some proclaim the texture of film can not be rivaled, others embrace the new possibilities of digital, and many fall into the middle of the debate. One thing seems fairly certain, though, there is no escaping this brave new world.Chris Kenneally packs a lot of information into \"Side by Side\" and Reeves is a genial host (bonus points for charting the different stages of his facial hair throughout). What makes the movie so enjoyable is that those who contribute to the discussion obviously love what they are doing. It's almost infectious. Anyone who loves the movies should not miss this one! Rarely do you get a chance to sit down with so much talent and have them wax on about the history of film. And again, the presentation is so loaded with movie clips that my brain went into overdrive compiling a list of classics that I needed to watch again. In the end, \"Side by Side\" adequately addresses its central theme. But unexpectedly, it's about much broader topics as well and has a real universal appeal. Informative and entertaining, this is an essential piece about modern movie making! KGHarris, 10/13."
B0090EJZA8 If you love film and film makers and ever dreamed of a time when you could sit down with Lucas or Cameron or Fincher or Scorcese here's your chance. The issue under discussion? The move from film to digital. The analysis? Priceless."
B0090EJZA8 This is an interesting documentary looking at how professional filmmakers look at digital film productions.  Most of the artists involved see digital for what it is, a great way to free film from the constraints of chemical capture (weight, expense, time limitations). The technicians are mostly against digital since it threatens their knowledge base. Many express the idea that making the means of production more democratic will make finding good films harder.  But what has the film industry done that would qualify for great films?  Transformers?  Battleship?  Batman?  Smaller films, often digitally produced, are where the art is happening in now. Well worth seeing if you are thinking about making a film with your DSLR, like I am."
B0090EJZA8 \"Side By Side\", narrated and co-produced by Keanu Reeves and directed by Christopher Kenneally, explores the history and implications of the film industry's migration to digital capture. Reeves both narrates and interviews over 70 people from the film industry about their experiences and feelings about film versus digital moviemaking. Some love film. Some were early adopters who fully embrace digital. Many have mixed feelings, because the different media have different strengths and weaknesses. The histories of film and digital movie cameras are interspersed at appropriate points between the interviews. The movie reaches the inevitable conclusion that digital will soon become the standard, but that may create more serious archiving problems than we've had with film.One strength of this treatment is the variety of people and professions who have the opportunity to share their points of view. The discussion is not confined to directors.  A surprising number of big name directors are interviewed: James Cameron, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Christopher Nolan, Danny Boyle, David Fincher, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Rodriguez, Lars Von Trier, as well as many directors of lesser-known independent film. Everyone seems to have something to say about the migration away from film and toward digital. People speak passionately from their own perspectives. But cinematographers and editors feel the impact of digital even more than directors do, and Reeves interviews a lot of them, likewise including big names and small.We also get a look at the workflows of film and digital, so we can see what these people are actually dealing with. Digital workflow is much faster, both in filming and editing. Directors, editors, and actors consider what this means for decision-making and for the final product.  Differences in how color timing is done and what it can achieve in both media are spotlighted. The narration also takes us through the evolution of the digital movie camera, so we can see how its limitations have been gradually overcome. A second strength of \"Side By Side\" is Reeves' interviewing style. He often plays devil's advocate to his interview subjects. He doesn't just accept what they say. He seems genuinely interested in the topic and in different points of view, so he engages the people he is interviewing.\"Side By Side\" runs about 1 hour 40 minutes, which I felt was too long. I would have cut about 10 minutes of interviews. It lags in the middle before picking up the pace again. And the narration could be improved by drawing some conclusions rather than always letting the interview subjects tell the story. But I enjoyed the film. I am a still photographer myself, and I prefer film to digital for personal work, but digital has great advantages for stock, editorial, portrait and wedding photography. It's unlikely that film will ever completely disappear for fine art use in still photography. But moviemaking is a different story, as photographing and editing movies with film is much more expensive than digital. And distribution will soon all be digital. Archiving is a big problem in the film industry, though. While it is easy to archive digital still images by printing them, it is not so easy to preserve digital movies, and they may all be lost.The DVD (New Video Group 2013): There are two bonus features, which both include deleted scenes. Some short \"Deleted Scenes\" (2  min) are brought to you by American Express. And there are a group of \"Additional Interviews with Filmmakers\" (14 min), who seem to all be directors. There are no subtitles available for the film."
B0090EJZA8 This documentary traces the history of digital video and weighs out all of it's pros and cons.  On the &#34;pro&#34; side, it has allowed thousands more low budget productions where the &#34;look&#34; is less important than the content.  On the &#34;con&#34; side, there is a definite &#34;artificiality&#34; to the way light, color, and movements blend together.  From now on, only &#34;purists&#34; will wait until the final cut before scanning 35mm to digital, just as only purist musicians will record and mix down on 2&#34; ampex multitrack tapes.  In both cases, going digital at the &#34;capture&#34; and &#34;processing&#34; stages introduces &#34;artifacts&#34; that are fatiguing to the eyes or ears.  Sadly, there will never be another new Stradivarius violin, Hammond B-3 organ, or Panavision 35mm and the difference is more than snobbery or nostalgia."
B0090EJZA8 (SPOILERS) documentary discusses Hollywood's transition from film to digital, i.e., how hard the movie industry fought digital, how George Lucas' tenacity helped get it established, and the mixture of emotions (some wistful) from filmmakers seeing film move out and digital move in.  In some ways, film to digital is an example of a way our species adopts new technology: someone discovers a new tool, or a better way (in the case of digital, George Lucas and his team); the established guard (Hollywood) resists, as they've invested heavily in the old technology (in terms of time, learning, and money), plus the new technology has some disadvantages (initially digital not as good visually as it is today), and the technicians, and everyone working in film, doesn't know how it works, or how to marry it with their current way of working, all of which generates fear/anxiety - so they basically ignore it;  while others (who have less to lose and most to gain, i.e., Robert Rodriguez, and other young and/or poor filmmakers) enthusiastically embrace it, exploiting it's advantages (real time viewing of photo capture, cheaper, and after a learning curve, ease of editing, etc.), to create their own brand of art, a significant amount of which becomes successful thus getting the attention of Hollywood who seek to emulate their success.  So now, by 2013 we see digital adopted into the Hollywood mainstream.  I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, which is why I wanted to see the documentary, and I'm an even bigger fan of George Lucas, who wrote my favorite film, Star Wars, A New Hope, so it was great seeing them, and all the other filmmakers and technicians talk about film.  Alot of what the technicians discussed went over my head.  The documentary itself wasn't told in an especially engaging way, but it was okay.  Probably will be of interest to future filmmakers studying film history.  For me, an ordinary viewer in the present, two and a half stars."
B0090EJZA8 It takes a veteran movie star - with name recognition - to gather as many A-list movie directors for a project like this and in this case actor Keanu Reeves fills that role brilliantly. As you will see by the many previous reviews posted here (all based on the Amazon Instant Video streaming version) this is a \"film\" - and I use that word cautiously here - about the move to \"digital\" from celluloid. Like the move from vinyl (and before that shellac) records to CDs and digital downloads for music, there is a strong debate as to whether the benefit of cheaper- and less time consuming - processes are better. New digital cameras are MUCH lighter and more portable and the digital images can be modified. But there is a loss in some of the \"reality\" of the images.  And, as for preservation, we are not sure how long the equipment - constantly changing - will survive. I won't get into that debate as this is not the place. And I won't repeat a lot of what others have provided as info in their reviews. I'll concentrate on the DVD home release.Reeves acts not only as the Producer of this \"film\" but does nearly all the on screen interviews. His questions are always insightful since he is in the business and has worked with many of the Directors, Cinematographers (now called DPs - for Director of Photography), and Editors. And he doesn't take sides.The front of the package lists SEVEN well known directors (Cameron, Fincher,Lucas,Lynch,Rodrigues.Scorsese, Soderberg - was Tarrantino busy?) You know all these names. But - couting the credits - there are 67 more interviewees (!) in this 99-minute documentary. These folks are ones you'd only know if you stayed for final credits after watching a movie.  The \"film\" explains the changes in cameras beginning in the 1990s and concentrating on the 2004-2006 period when Sony and Panovision and Red changed the playing field, so to speak.You will hear George Lucas defend digital while Scorsese is sticking to film - for its use as an archival medium.Yes, it gets a bit too technical for the casual movie goer but not that technical. Again, it's Reeves' questions that keep the doc flowing.The BluRay Disc looks great on even a standard non-HD TV. There are two bonus features: The first consists of four deleted scenes which total just 2  minutes; the other contains and addition 12 interviews (total time of this is 13 minutes).So I'd recommend this to anyone interest in the film industry, technology or film preservation.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B0090EJZA8 I'm usually down for a good film-based documentary, so I decided to give this one a try as it looked like such an interested concept.  While it was indeed a very intriguing subject, one has to truly be a hard-core film buff (the technical stuff) to really get into it.The topic of \"digital film\" vs \"celluloid film\" truly is a fascinating one and deserves a documentary like this.  Whenever a medium change is about to define any industry, it is always a turning point filled with pros and cons that must be discussed in order to obtain some sort of understanding.  That concept is the high point of \"Side by Side\".Sadly, I wish they would have made this doc a bit more \"user-friendly\" to those (like me) who wanted to see the comparison \"in action\".  There is far too much \"talking\" and far too little actually comparison of the two film methods.  Clearly, this was a doc made for not just film buffs, but more towards camera buffs who really get into the technical stuff.The choice of Keanu Reeves as narrator/host is also a terrible one, as his dry, bland story lends nothing towards the excitement factor.Thus, \"Side by Side\" will be a great little doc for those internally fascinated by film.  If you are just a \"movie fan\", however, you can probably skip it."
B0090X4IYW A classic story of passion gone wrong. It is hard to feel sympathy for a mother who abandoned her child to 'live in sin'. On the other hand one is filled with distaste for the  hypocrisy of the society that she lives in."
B0090X4IYW This is possibly the best romance story ever told. Many books and movies have wove some element of this story because it is so great. If you have read the book (many pages!) this movie stays very much true to the book. The book tells of the great beauty of Anna, so much so that everyone who sees her, are struck with that beauty. That's a tough act to follow, maybe Elizabeth Taylor could have pulled it off. The actoriss in this story is very talented, and she is beautiful, maybe not Anna Karenina beautiful, but IMHO her talent pulls it off. And sure, if you have never been in nuorotic crazy love, the movie may be lost on you. The filming and sets are well done, actors are excellent. Masterpice Theater always does a \"master\" job. I just finished reading Anna Karenina again (read it many years ago) when I heard there was a new movie released on it. I checked Amazon Prime to see if they had at least one of the old versions of \"Anna\", and found this. \"Anna\" has done many times, and I think I like this as one of the best as it stays true to the book. Incidently the author of the book the movie was based on, really has some other legendary \"have to read in your lifetime\" books, and many consider \"Anna\" his best and closest to his real life."
B0090X4IYW I only watched the first 30 minutes or so. It just couldn't hold my attention. The acting was so-so, and personally, Anna didn't appear near as beautiful as described in the books. This one cannot top the version with Vivian Leigh in any way.I was glad that the actors did not try to imitate the Russian accents. It would have made the story even harder to stick with.Sorry, just not my cup of vodka."
B0090X4IYW One of my favorite novels but one that seemingly can't be compressed into a movie.  This try collapses the ending beyond reasonable bounds.  But my biggest issue is that I just couldn't identify this Anna with the Annas of Greta Garbo or Vivian Leigh & the Vronsky was even less my ideal of a dashing soldier-of-fortune."
B0090X4IYW Another sad story which has been made over and over. I guess this is another one every director wants to make due to the subject matter plus the shocking ending. Those stories where women were not allowed to do what the men did but were treated as whores and outcasts by society, while the man involved could continue on as always, do make me feel anger. I always want to rewrite the ending to Anna."
B0090X4IYW The familiar story, beautifully portrayed.  No surprises her but all interesting.  The acting was excellent and the leading actors all beautiful.  What more could you want to watch?"
B0090X4IYW Contrived chemistryContained cinematographyConcealed ActingWhere's the Epic?A waste of time ... why are there so many versions of this classic - no one gets it right?"
B0090X4IYW I enjoyed this first season of Anna Karenina very much.  This one of those literary classics I have always wanted to 'see' as a series or movie and I was not disappointed.  I wish the ending had been different, but then it is about her life as it happened, not how I would wish it for her.  It was narrow in its scope so that the story centered around the characters and their emotions without too much outside distraction from period fashion, politics, and world events.  I would recommend it to any student of Russian history and anyone who loves a love story; even a tragic one."
B0090XDE2Y The talent this year has yet to disappoint.  On this 3rd episode the challage was, as teams of two they were to fabricate by mixing both of the animals each represented in the chinese calander (i.e ox and rat), and they had to withstand a dance sequence.  I was impresed by any sad by who went home. Can't wait for the next episode.."
B0090XDE2Y This show is a great watch !! I normally don't like reality tv but Face Off just sucked me in !! The imagination people shoe in practical effects is absolutely AWSOME !!!"
B0090XDE2Y This is another wonderful season of Face Off. There isn't a lot of drama with having the 'wrong' contestant stick around far longer than needed. It's stellar season."
B0090XDE2Y This third season is nit as good as the previous 2. There seems to be a slightly lower caliber of artist and the glomming up has left this show feeling a little cold. While the right person won in the end, the challenges felt a little stale and at times, even the judges looked a little fed up. I hope that they manage to bring the next season back up to those ofn1 and 2"
B0090XDE2Y This is a really fun show.  I have never had a huge interest in sci-fi shows but this show has made me a fan."
B0091P60PY I heard the movie was go and they were right. It was a solid story. The plot was predictable but not a hindrance to enjoying the movie. The acting was solid from all participants. Decent special effects that were not heavy handed. Give it a try."
B0091P60PY This was a really fun movie to watch.  I thought it was well done, the acting was engaging, and special effects were believable.  I didn't have much expectation going into it, but came out wanting to purchase this movie and I will.  It was that good.  So for a fun ride, some moments you find yourself getting caught up in the story, and a decent ending, I recommend this movie!"
B0091P60PY This is the movie where I found out Johnny Cash was not the original man in black. It was Solomon Kane. And he's really black. Except where he's exceptionally pale, because, it's like medieval England and, well, we all know about the weather in England. It's never sunny. I never really \"got\" this movie. So, here's this guy who used to be bad, but turns good, but not because he wants to, but has to because of true love. He never really falls for the chick too hard, which is a surprise to me. I mean, if she's the reason he's keeping on, shouldn't he, like, show her? Instead, he is, THE MAN IN BLACK. And the fight scenes. If the movie were to showcase his badassery, I don't think they did a fantastic job. He, cuts, he slices, he dices, but he, to my my taste, didn't do so with panache, with infinite style, with a certain Bondian charm. People die, sure, but, The man in black works at it, so it's not really justice served with a side of immortal reason, it's more justice served with a bunch of grunting and farting, if you will. Samurai pictures show swordsmanship that is truly spectacular, ten people die with three strokes. That's amazing. I suppose the fighting in the man in black is more \"realistic,\" but, in a movie where all manner of flying beasts and demons appear, is \"reality\" really a major point?"
B0091P60PY Not quite sure how to explain my rating of this film but it was an okay movie on a rainy day. Lots of blood and gore so hide the kiddos. I covered my dogs eyes hahaha!"
B0091P60PY Although not a cinematic classic I felt it was entertaining. It was gritty and well done. The sets where realistic and for a lower budget movie the acting and effects where pretty good."
B0091P60PY I hoped that I'd like this movie from the previews and I did, quite a lot. Solomon Kane, from the first, caught my interest because of his particular problem concerning his soul. Care of the soul is a universal problem and I immediately identified with him. The setting was so appropriate to his character, wild, yet tame, Organized, yet chaotic. Solomon Kane has dept, action, and substance, because of all the elements of picture making and how they line up: character, setting, costuming, plot, character interaction, villains and even a damsel in distress. Recommended"
B0091P60PY I think the online price for this was high; however, I am glad I did not pay to see this in a theater.  It was plodding and the only value in watching was some of the special effects and costumes.  I doubt if this film will be in theaters long."
B0091P60PY It's finally here!! One of the best & underrated action, fantasy movies ever. It's a real shame this 2009 movie didn't get a more mainstream release here in the U.S. but thankfully this comes with several special features to complete the viewing experience. I'm sure Robert E. Howard would give this adaptation his seal of approval as this is a much better film than Marcus Nispel's clumsy 2011 Conan flick. Michael J. Bassett & James Purefoy have achieved a cult favorite movie that a plethora of film maker's who want to cement their two cents on a genre piece would be envious of. This is everything a great film should be."
B0091P60PY the plot was ridiculous and the story line was over all very very slow  its pace was sleepy and i lost interest after the first 20 minutes the story line is very very predictable girl get kidnapped girl gets rescued bla bla bla  dont waste your money"
B0091P60PY To be honest, I'm a huge R.E. Howard fan so my review is going to be a little biased.  Solomon Kane is probably my favorite character from the Howard universe so I was really excited to see this film.  James Purefoy makes a perfect Solomon Kane, brooding and introspective at the right times, brash and full of abandon at others (to show the transformation he makes).  The atmosphere a
B0091P60PY Solomon Kane is a man who's sworn an oath of peace after living a life of constantly being in battle and killing. He was an incredibly evil man. Along the way, his soul became damned and now the devil wants him to pay his dues. When Kane decides he isn't quite ready to go to hell, the devil unleashes his \"children\" out upon the earth to wreak havoc. Kane's oath and the religious marks on his body are the only things keeping him in hiding, but his oath is put to the test when a family who has taken him in is endangered by \"the man with no face\" and his henchmen.Ever wonder what it would be like if Van Helsing didn't suck? To take that idea a bit further, ever wonder what it would be like if the films Van Helsing and Constantine were able to mate and its offspring was a film that was actually pretty awesome? In a nutshell, that's what you get with Solomon Kane. On the surface, Solomon Kane is very similar to Van Helsing. It has the same look and atmosphere of Van Helsing without all the monster hunting. In place of the monsters, we get demons. That's where the Constantine influence comes in. Solomon Kane's religious undertones, use of mirrors, and conclusion are all very reminiscent of Constantine.Certain elements of the film may not be as absorbing as others. The CGI in the film seemed to fluctuate between being pretty good to below par. The crucifixion scene didn't really work either. Why Kane did what he did in that scene makes sense, but his actions and what he does immediately after that is pretty hard to swallow.Solomon Kane isn't without its flaws, but is basically the gory, more adult, and definitive version of what Van Helsing should have been. With the amount of decapitated heads that are rolling around, every action scene littered with splattered blood, and its darker twists on religious views, Solomon Kane delivers a blood-soaked cinematic delight."
B0091P60PY Sword and sorcery flick where the good guy is a former bad guy trying to make things right.  Violence and a lot of hand combat.  Visually rich and entertaining if you like the \"dark knight\" kind of film. Teens and older. Not recommended for young children."
B0091P60PY I took a chance on getting this and am glad I did.  I wasn't familiar with the Solomon Kane stories before getting this movie, but now I'm intrigued and will have to explore them.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story of good and evil, and the redemption of a man's soul, though it was a bumpy road to get there.  And that's where the fun is, the bumps on the road provide lots of action and move the story forward quite nicely.  Very entertaining viewing."
B0091P60PY never read the booksnever heard of this hero! beforemight we privvy to some morelets keep this one around"
B0091P60PY I recommend this film. This film is from England,but a great flick. James Purefoy was made for this role. Short review......"
B0091P60PY There are very few good scifi and fantasy movies on the market these days.  This one is one of the best!  It is worth every penny!  The story of redemption was excellent because it put a spotlight on the internal battle between right and wrong that we all face every day!  Excellent acting, excellent effects, excellent story!"
B0091P60PY It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to its hype. It really could have been done better in my opinion."
B0091P60PY I was expecting this movie to be a dud, but it came on with a bang. I enjoyed it a lot. Don't watch this if you don't like period movies, and sword and sorcerry type adventures. For those that like Conan and movies like it, I say you will enjoy this movie as well."
B0091P60PY Great mix of Middle Ages life with more reasonable science fiction magic inclusions.  Provides insight to life outside the walled cities and earlier magic/religion traditions.  I'm a senior citizen and my 26 year old son both watched this and really liked the movie enough to watch it again."
B0091P60PY I have no idea where this movie came from, but I suddenly noticed it, and it caught my eye. I expected something on par with a SyFy original movie, but I was wrong- the quality of this movie is much, much higher. It can be a tad cheesy and melodramatic at times, but for the most part, this is a great medieval fantasy movie with solid acting, effects, and plot. I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on supernatural elements, and Kane's battle to redeem his wicked soul. The plot is also developed surprisingly well, with a few elements that I did not see coming. Solid and fun!"
B0091P60PY This is a comic book characiture but rings true as an iconic hero for the ages.Great Log Line: \"A ruthless mercenary renounces violence after learning his soul is bound for hell. When a young girl is kidnapped and her family slain by a sorcerer's murderous cult, he is forced to fight and seek his redemption slaying evil.\"That says it all.James Purefoy resembles Hugh Jackman quite a bit and is almost as good.Superior casting, acting, cgi, action, direction and cinematography. This is a truly mythic character---not highly developed here, but brilliant on the part of the creator; truely great. Needs development....I really wanted to see Rachel Hurd-Woodf naked; maybe innocently walking into a cold river to bathe. She has got a grreat looking rack, under all that virginal linen (I can tell), and our hero needs more motivation than just the fact she made him a frigging shirt!!A very good movie; see it!."
B0091P60PY I love James Purefoy. This movie was okay, it had good scenes, and the stroy line was okay. But not as good as so many other of his projects."
B0091P60PY Robert E. Howard's most celebrated swordsman is indisputably Conan the Barbarian, but just because the brooding Cimmerian towers above the rest of Howard's sword & sorcery pulp heroes doesn't mean these other characters aren't worth a look. Two such strapping blokes immediately come to mind: Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane. In his brief span of life Howard imagined some truly dark heroes, but none more dark and bleak than this morose 17th Century Puritan. Solomon Kane is the most complex character Howard would construct.His soul damned for past acts of murder and rapacity, Solomon Kane now strives for redemption, has embarked on a life of peace and non-violence. But when darkness once more stalks the land, Kane must take up his sword and his genius for gristly battle. He dons that trademark big-brimmed Puritan's slouch hat. We learn how he ends up with that hat. This, after all, is his origin story.It's a polished, top drawer production, I'll tell the world. Most tellingly, Writer / Director Michael J. Bassett manages to capture onscreen the dark atmosphere so rife in those Solomon Kane exploits published many decades ago in WEIRD TALES, the classic pulp magazine. Solomon Kane, seeking salvation, negotiates a terrifying world inhabited by infernal forces. The sole bright spot in this damned man's life manifests in the shape of a traveling Puritan family that takes in an injured Kane. The viewer will have seen this coming: It's inevitable that Solomon Kane's dark nature would render these good people vulnerable to predation from fiendish powers. Kane remarks to the family's patriarch: \"My soul is damned. Satan's creatures would take me should I stray from the path of peace.\" Me, I would've tore the hell out of there, upon hearing such confession. Except, in the wake of impending tragedy, Solomon Kane at last sees a way to undamn his soul. Save the cheerlea- er, save the Puritan girl... save the world.James Purefoy assumes a dour demeanor and is magnificent, breathing life and dimension into the grim Puritan. The crucial moment was always gonna be how convincing Purefoy would look once we see him in that black cloak and big hat and wielding the sword and blasting away with his brace of flintlock pistols. It's gratifying to see Purefoy pulling it off so well. I don't know that I've ever seen him in action roles before, but he is a natural. He certainly has the physical presence. He cleaves thru bone and gristle with bloody conviction. Tell me it's not a brilliant moment of assownery when Purefoy surrenders his vow of peace and growls to Satan's minions: \"If I kill you, I am bound for Hell. It is a price I shall gladly pay.\"SOLOMON KANE is graced with a solid supporting cast that includes Max Von Sydow, a sense of desolation that drives the mood, eye-catching compositions and sleek special effects (love the scene in which demons erupt from the mirrors), and an intense James Purefoy. Michael J. Bassett's hope is that this is the first in an epic trilogy, and he really is off to a fantastic start. The Puritan's work is still far from done. To quote the damn fugly witch in this movie: \"All the Devil's children are free to walk the earth now.\" But the Devil's children would do well not to bump into men with big buckled hats and somber dispositions.The DVD's bonus material: The Making of SOLOMON KANE featurette (00:04:23 minutes long); interviews with actors James Purefoy, Pete Postlethwaite, Max Von Sydow, Rachel Hurd-Wood, and director Michael J. Bassett; clips from the film - note that these aren't deleted or extended scenes (00:05:42); the trailer; and \"B-Roll,\" which basically is behind-the-scenes footage (00:20:01)."
B0091P60PY I gave this movie 5 stars because it was very enjoyable and not your &#34;run of the mill&#34; story line.  I wasn't expecting what I saw and when that happens I tend to enjoy the movie much more.  When it is made available for purchase I will be buying it as I feel it has re playability."
B0091P60PY A good story of evil and then revenge that will make you feel satisfied. A bit of fantasy and supernatural mumbo jumbo but a fun popcorn eating movie."
B0091P60PY I'm not saying is doesn't work, it does work. This guy has a mission. I've seen that devil before. I'm wondering if they didn't use the same special effects people. Lots of blood. Good vs evil. Sort of."
B0091P60PY Well, I rented this movie after seeing the behind the scenes for it and it looked good, but the actual watching of the movie was slow, did not show the action that looked so cool during the movie behind the scenes.  It was ok but not the best."
B0091P60PY The same year that the Conan reboot was released, a limited theater film based on the same author's works was released entitled Solomon Kane. Based of the swashbuckling pirate-turned-evil slayer, the film depicts Solomon as a criminal who renounces violence in order to keep his soul from being taken by the Devil's Reaper, who had already arrived to claim his soul. But when a family Kane cares about is attacked and the daughter taken, Kane returns to his violent ways to save the girl, but at the cost of his soul.Written and directed by Michael J. Basset, Solomon Kane is a fantastic, lower budgeted film that succeeds where the new Conan failed in every way. The script was not Oscar-worthy, but it was memorable and fun, with nothing dumb or unnecessary. Basset's directing was superb as well, capturing the 17th century as a dark, gloomy and eerie time where evil was hiding everywhere. The acting was great, especially James Purefoy who plays Kane. Broken, ashamed and good-hearted, Purefoy gives us a character that is a mix of Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing and Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher; he's a guy who you do not mess with, and will do whatever it takes to make sure the right thing is done, even if it means killing. The music by Klaus Badelt is amazing, and I am saddened that they have not released the score; it's a mix of Howard Shore's The Hobbit and James Newton Howard's Snow White & the Huntsman. The visual effects, while decent in some places (due to the budget) are very, very impressive in others, especially the Fire Demon at the end of the film.Overall, Solomon Kane is a wildly thrilling roller-coaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. They need to create a sequel to this because, even though it didn't recoup its budget at the box office (because the distributors are idiots) there is so much potential and more tales that they can adapt to the screen, maybe even making a trilogy to match Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy. Please, epic fantasy fans, action fans and period piece fans, watch this movie and help spread the word. They devoted their time and put their hearts into this movie; lets show them fans do care4.5/5 Stars"
B0091P60PY I wasn't  sure what to  expect  from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. The acting is superb . James purefoy is awesome as the main character. A must see!"
B0091P60PY The main character has an interesting life story, that gets explained in flashbacks throughout the movie.  The plot brings him full circle in addressing his past.  The action is mostly swords and fists.  I just really enjoyed an action flick without two thirds of it being CGI."
B0091P60PY i like it, but ive had it for over a year, kinda confused how its just hitting theaters but hey whatever lol"
B0091P60PY As movies of this genre go, this one probably really only deserves 3 stars, but James Purefoy pushes it to 4. I was a little disappointed that the movie was not quite as good as the trailer."
B0091P60PY Robert E Howard, most famous for his Conan the Cimmerian stories, was a prolificwriter who also created several other mythical past worlds.  One of them is theworld inhabited by Solomon Kane, a somewhat unlikely character set in the late1600s or early 1700's, a Puritan who wanders about fighting evil with a sword,dagger, muskets, and some magic.  In the stories (published long ago inthe pulp magazine Weird Tales) he's described as a man of pale face, graveexpression, dark eyes, dressed all in black and usually wearing a droopy hat.Someone had the courage to try to make this into a movie.  I did not think itcould be done and be interesting and believable.It's done; it's interesting, even believable, if you like fantasy novels and films.This was good enough, I'm even hoping for a sequel."
B0091P60PY [I wrote this review here for the European edition three years ago, and just saw the US dvd. My comments on the US edition are that it's also excellent! Good commentary and also interviews with Purefoy and the director, nice making of docs, and a very nice transfer. In the interviews you can see they were hoping for a franchise and sequels out of this character, so perhaps there will be more to come.]4.5 starsI'm a big fan of Robert E. Howard, and have wondered since the '70s why no one has ever filmed Kane. The character is tailor-made for American viewers: puritan ethos with righteous bloodlust. Hey, that's our foreign policy! And now that a very good version of Kane has been made, why hasn't it been released in the US?A fellow Howard fan sent me this from Europe, and I expected little from it despite being a James Purefoy fan, especially of his Mark Antony in HBO's Rome. JP seems only at his best, however, when he's playing a character with some real demons, such as Antony [edit, 8/8/13: I stand by that thought more than ever, as he's now playing a serial killer on US tv!]. In other things like some BBC flicks and 2009's NBC series The Philanthropist, Purefoy suffers from Nice Guy syndrome and starts seeming cheesy. But Kane is the perfect role for him, as he can show his dark and light sides to equal advantage. He does a wonderful job here and is quite believable as Solomon, haunted by his past and doomed to relive its evil ways, but now in the service of good.MJ Bassett might be faulted by Howard purists for creating some of the backstory here, but I found it true to the Kane ethos, and the script is much more nuanced than the usual sword and sorcery flick. Bassett's direction is also excellent, with many huge pans of the brooding countryside under leaden skies, and the rain comes down in buckets and makes it all that much more atmospheric. The film starts a little slowly but before 30 minutes are up we're well into it and the action and (thankfully) exploration of character never lets up. The stunts are well done and there's minimal CGI, which adds to the dark realism, and the picture has a pleasing graininess that suits the material perfectly.Postlethwaite and Von Sydow are both outstanding, as usual, and while I somehow kept expecting things to get cheesy and go off the rails it never happened. Instead the heavy swordplay is leavened with some moments of real emotion; Purefoy can be a fine actor with real depth when given the right material.All in all, this was one of the best cinematic surprises I've seen this year, and is highly recommended to anyone who likes action, sorcery, dark atmosphere, heavy drama and the fantasy genre in general. And if you like Purefoy you will love seeing him in this. The guy is poised to become a huge star if he can keep finding roles that suit him this well.Expect a sequel!And dang...release this thing in the States. It's got sleeper cult hit written all over it."
B0091P60PY Movie was good for an action flic. Acting was ok. Nothing sparked but would have liked more scenes where Purefoy was involved in aggressive fighting."
B0091P60PY Of all the extremely numerous Robert E. Howard stories, those describing the adventures and tribulations of Solomon Kane are amongst the most succesful - and also possibly the hardest to film. Therefore one must already give a good point to Michael J. Bassett for even trying to tackle this great classic of fantasy/adventure letters. In my personal opinion, this film managed well to reproduce the ultra-dark style of Solomon Kane stories, but was less succesful in picturing the \"hero\" himself - and that notwithstanding the really good performance of James Purefoy.After reading all the stories about Kane, I personally came to believe that he was not entirely alive - for me Solomon Kane was a kind of spectral shade of a man, paroled from the Purgatory and released on Earth to track the worst kind of warlocks, witches and all other kind of people using the surnatural to commit evil deeds. I was comforted in this feeling by the fact that he seemed never eat, drink or sleep and in all his dealings with people he was as laconic, cold and distant as possible. Also, Kane is always described as gaunt and grim with almost dead eyes, but still looking at the world with a kind of cold intensity. Now, for this movie, James Purfoy created a Kane who was quite grim and threatening, but not even close to the one from the books - his Kane certainly looks very dangerous but no one would mistake him for a vengeful wraith!Even more important were the mistakes in the scenario. Kane is supposed to be a Puritan, and this allegiance strengthens considerably his dangerosity (Puritans were after all as fanatical as today's jihadists) - but in the beginning we see him living in a monastery, an institution which for a Puritan would be the very forteress of Devil and his Papist servants! After that we see Kane gently entertaining (totally innocently) a beautiful damsel - which is completely against the character from the stories! Finally, I believe that giving Kane a background and explaining it, was at least partially a mistake - this character was so cool in the books because he was a complete mystery. The one thing known, was that he was a man with mission and that very probably that mission was in the same time his redemption and his pennance - but his past and especially the horrible sins he had to atone for were unknown. By removing this veil of mystery, I believe the character in the movie was harmed.That being said, if one discards Robert E. Howard stories, this film is very honest. Some of the episodes in the movie were borrowed from others Howard stories (especially the \"Conan\" series) but they were very skillfully included. The subplot including Kane's family was not half bad - even if as I stated before I believe it would be even better if it was not included... The episodes with the witch and the lone priest in the abandoned church were excellent! The villains were very evil and the ultimate foe is very impressive. And the whole visual aspect of the film is excellent. James Purfoy plays admirably. Rachel Hurd-Wood is certainly a delight to contemplate - gosh, did this girl grow well since \"Peter Pan\"! Last but not least, it is one of the last occasions when we could admire Pete Postlethwaite considerable talent, which sadly is now no more available...Bottom line, this is a very honest fantasy/adventure movie, although definitely not a masterpiece - you just need to forget a little about Robert E. Howard stories if you want to appreciate it and spend a nice popcorn/movie evening."
B0091P60PY IT's rare for a filmic version of a comics persona/series - much less a classic of the &#34;pulp&#34; novels of the early 20th Century -  to keep the feel of the original intact. While it has some flaws, Solomon Kane manages to absorb the viewer as the novel does and yet bring some of the &#34;telegraphic&#34; feel of the comic as well. If you want a nice escape from reality on a rainy afternoon, this is a good choice. It ain't great art, but that's not what one should expect of fantasy-adventure. Purefoy is believable, the bad guys are really bad, the good guy is conflicted and therefore interesting, and the production is lush with nice special effects and a whole lot of wicked costuming."
B0091P60PY I can not begin to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. Made in 2009 and sitting on the shelf for 4 years now all I could think to myself while watching it was why did was this film held back while so much drek made it's way to the big screen? Why weren't we allowed to watch this film in theaters rather than having to wait to see it at home?For those unfamiliar with the character Kane was a creation of author Robert E. Howard prior to his writing his most famous character Conan the barbarian. As a pulp fiction character he was perhaps as widely read but for some reason never considered as marketable by film makers. Until now.James Purefoy stars as Kane, a ruthless privateer in 1600 supposedly working for the King but in truth working only for himself. For Kane killing is an art that he does well and often as he and his men cut their way through body upon body as they try to find a treasure considered lost and hidden. As they approach the room said to contain this treasure, Kane and his men are separated. While hearing their death screams Kane finds the treasure but at the same time finds someone waiting for him. This is the reaper, sent to collect Kane's soul to be taken to Hell. Kane escapes intent on doing anything he can to redeem himself.Several years later we find Kane living in a monastery. He has sworn off his past ways, making an oath to never raise a hand or rapier against any man. Living a life of penance, Kane is approached by the head of monastery and asked to leave. God has spoken to him and told him that it would be best if Kane did so.Kane obeys and on his trek to find what God has intended for him he is attacked and robbed, refusing to lift a hand against his attackers. Found by William Crowthorn and his family, puritans on their way to America, he is mended and travels with them for a time. During their travels they come upon a village where everyone was wiped out in what appears to be a witch burning. Everyone except a young girl who swears her family was taken from her. When Kane recognizes her for what she is she marks the William's daughter Meredith and disappears.Their travels continue and one day Kane walks ahead in the forest and comes across a group of mercenaries capturing people and caging them to take to their home base. When he returns to the Crowthorns he finds them under attack as well. Refusing to fight, he witnesses their deaths with the exception of young Meredith who is captured. William, knowing what Kane is capable of, makes him swear to save Meredith. Turning his eyes to the heavens Kane asks what God wants of him. It is then that he realizes he was sent here to use the skills he acquired as a killer in the hopes of saving the land from these mercenaries and the marauder who leads them.Back to his killing ways Kane confronts numerous bad guys, finding himself in situations where he's never quite sure who to trust. In the end his skills help him not only rid the world of some terrible people but lead him towards Meredith as well. Will Kane be placing his soul in jeopardy once more by living his life like this? Or will his attempt to rescue someone be the one redeeming feature needed to save his soul?This movie is a fantastic action film that not only delivers scene for scene thrills but offers tons of story to go along with it. Background stories of Kane when he was young, discovering who is behind this plague of murder across the land and the battle Kane struggles with for his immortal soul blend together to make a tale that would serve Howard proud.The movie is just now released on blu-ray and all I can say is that it is one of the most spectacular displays of imagery that I've seen on film in some time. Every shot feels like it is about to pop off the screen at you and this movie is NOT in 3D! The clarity on display is so sharp as to be razor keen. The composition of the shots by the director and cinematographer are splendid with each one being the most perfect shot they could have gotten. There is not one shot in this film that seemed incomplete or done imperfectly.The acting is wonderful as well with Purefoy taking on the task of playing Kane in both his wild days and his repentant ways with equal skill. It would be easy to swagger around swinging a sword and looking evil at all times. But in the character of Kane Purefoy shows the inner struggle that he feels with each confrontation he avoids and then with each death he brings about. He wants to do the right thing and thinks that is to not kill or defend himself. When he finds out this is not his path, he takes to his old ways like a duck to water but at the same time feeling remorse that he didn't have early on.There is only one sad thing about this film and that is that it never received the attention it should have. As I said this movie was better than probably 75% of the movies I saw this past year and deserved to be treated better. This IS a movie that you will watch and wish that they would make sequels to. While it's rather doubtful that will happen, perhaps enough copies will be sold to make that dream come true. If not, at least we have this film to hold on to and watch over and over wishing that the path of Solomon Kane were one we could follow again and again."
B0091P60PY When I realized SOLOMON KANE had been made into a movie, I was instantly intrigued.  I've read a couple of Kane stories over the years and always enjoyed them; as such, I had always hoped to see him materialize on the big screen.  I'm happy to report this movie adaptation is worthy of the title and certainly merits your consideration.When I first thought about SOLOMON KANE in movie form, there were several things that I hoped the production team would consider:  the film needed to be dark, it needed to be edgy, and the title role needed to be portrayed by an actor that can do both good-guy and bad-guy personas.  Thankfully, all three concerns were addressed.  The result is a great film that will take you on a hell of a ride (no pun intended).SOLOMON KANE is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  The visuals set the tone and mood of the film perfectly, presenting a foreboding and bleak landscape in which to set the drama.  Likewise, the cast does a superb job in their roles, with James Purefoy headlining as the titular character.  Purefoy does a masterful job of showing both the light and dark sides of Kane's soul.  His performance lends a major amount of credibility to this film.The special effects look go
B0091P60PY MINI REVIEW: a rousing action tale of sword and sorcery that delivers on setting and fighting primarily. Set amidst a parallel world in which Puritans and others must deal with true evil in the early 1600s the once mercenary Solomon Kane (played by James Purefoy) has turned to a life of peace because he has discovered his horrible life has put his soul up for grabs from the D/devil. Naturally he goes into isolation but the horrors of evil eventually call his fighting abilities up to save the daughter of a dying father (the latter promising Kane his soul will be redeemed if he saves his daughter). This 2009 film wasn't released on DVD until 2013. The movie does an admirable job of staying true to the stories they were based on by author Robert E. Howard, especially in fighting style. It was funded by a number of European companies. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B."
B0091P60PY It's a pretty good movie but I don't understand why it's not available in the U.S. on dvd. James Purfoy does a good job playing Soloman Kane.  It's a good adaptation of the classic story."
B0091P60PY To those not familiar with the character, Solomon Kane was one of the fictional creations of Texas writer Robert E Howard of the early 20th century.  Specializing in sword and sorcery, the stories and ensuing comic books have now been brought to life in a full-length feature film starring some smaller name Hollywood stars.  Though the original stories occurred throughout the world, this movie takes place firmly in Europe at the height of the Age of Discovery.  The movie begins with prologue describing the evil ways of Kane, and how he came to redemption.  The meat of the movie shows Kane wandering Europe avoiding sin until it finally catches up with him in the form of an evil army which he must defeat.  At its root is a fallen brother who works for the devil (don't they always).  And so we have the climactic battle between good and evil where Kane somehow vanquishes the devil with hardly a scratch to his body or soul.As a movie the acting is enough to carry the plot forward.  The dialogue is good, nothing cheesy or hokey.  The cinematography was good when it was not dark and shadowy.  As to the fight scenes; lets just say they were fast, furious, bloody, and often times ridiculous as we see one man slay hundreds in his way.  But then again the latter is a common fault in just about all sword and sorcery films.  There is little comedy, and minimal romance, just blustery action with some suspense if you suspend disbelief for a while.  Overall, an average action flick from Hollywood."
B0091P60PY An interesting movie but very dark.  I watched it once and decided I probably wouldn't watch it again.  I donated it to my local library."
B0091P60PY I had read about this film and was glad to finally see it and own it on DVD. The story is based on a character created by Robert E Howard the man who released Conan the Barbarian on the public many years ago. Solomon never reached the heaghts of Howard's Barbarian tales but this film just may bring in enough interest in the stories for some to try and find them.The story deviates from the pulp source it came from, but the story is well told. It gives Solomon a back ground and purpose. The film is well put together and the cgi effects and make up are effective.James Purfoy is fine as the hero and brings a harsh quality that is needed in this character. All of the acting is top notch and the sets are also very impressive. My only quibble is the pacing was off and that slowed down the film in parts. Overall a rousing film worth taking a look at.Anchor Bay did their ussual solid transfer and sound on the dvd and I really enjoyed all of the extras. Commentary is something I always look forward to and enjoy."
B0091P60PY Solomon Kane (Michael J. Bassett, 2009)Been sitting on this Solomon Kane review for a lot longer than usual; I'm writing this on December 14, 2010, and I actually watched the movie back on October 16. I kept putting it off, trying to come up with something compelling to say about this movie, but a couple of days ago I realized that was never going to happen there is nothing compelling about this movie. It's a Sci-Fi Channel original on steroids and with marginally better production values, but it's basically a Sci-Fi Channel original Movie nonetheless.Solomon Kane (Resident Evil's James Purefoy) is a former mercenary who, after the particularly vicious sacking of a town, loses his soul to the devil. As a result, he renounces his life of violence and retires to seclusion in a monastery in the remote countryside. All well and good until the monks decide that, given the state of his soul, he's too much of a threat to keep around. They toss him out on his ear, and while traveling, he falls in with a band of merry travelers, the Crowthorns. Father William (The Usual Suspects' Pete Postlethwaite) is a caring sort who scoops Kane up off the road whilst he's injured and unconscious, and as he recovers, he gets to be friends with the rambunctious son, Samuel (Patrick Hurd-Wood, real-life brother to Rachel), and there's some hefty sexual tension with the daughter, Meredith (said Rachel, recently of An American Haunting). All goes well, again, except that, you know, the devil is on his tail, and he must eventually realize that pacifism is probably not the way to go in the face of so implacable a foe (and said foe's henchmen).The most impressive thing about this flick, hands down, is the cast. I didn't mention Max von Sydow, who plays Kane's father, though he generally looks lost during his two minutes or so of screen time. Nor Alice Krige as the matron of the Crowthorns, and Alice Krige, like Pete Postlethwaite, is always a welcome sight on a screen. Or Jason Flemyng, perhaps the least-known, but most talented, of the stable Guy Ritchie made Lock Stock... and Snatch with (a group that has given us, among others, Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones). Philip Winchester (Camelot). Ryan James (The Illusionist). The list goes on. There is a heavy load of acting talent to be found here. And collectively it does the best it can with a tired script, adapted by Bassett from source by Robert E. Howard.Do people never learn? Has there, to date, been a single decent movie adapted from Howard's work? (Let me help you out with that one: no.) Tto flicks, two TV series, and four video games, and no one's figured out how to do Conan the Barbarian right yet. And we'll not even mention Red Sonja except in passing. (But we have to pause and snigger at Kull the Conqueror, which at least revels in its awfulness.) You have to blame this, at least partly, on the slavish devotion people seem to feel to Howard's work; no one is willing to update away the archaic attitudes, take into account differences in expected pacing then and now, that sort of thing.Don't get me wrong, in the world of Howard adaptations, it's clearly the best of a bad lot, and if you're looking for a generic actioner with supernatural elements, you can do a whole lot worse than this. But classic cinema it is not, and from the gushing of some reviewers, you might be expecting it. ***"
B0091P60PY I thought it was OK I expected a bit more but it wasn't horrible, and it held my interest; next time step it up!"
B0091P60PY Amazon, once again, has brought to us a unique opportunity to view and enjoy a pre-release movie. I gotta love this program. Not only is this a great movie about good vs evil and redemption, but it never got boring. Even in the non-action sections, where scenery and dialogue ruled, it kept moving forward. The action scenes were terrific aided by the beautiful music score and the incredible actors. I remember James Purefoy from the early years in Mansfield Park to Rome and even George and the Dragon (which is pure fun to watch). Some say his work in the series The Philanthorpist  was weak and cheesy, but I say that the man can do his job very well. I actually own the series and have continued to enjoy it. I was confused at first to learn that this was originally filmed in 2009 then only a European release in 2010 and just now limited release in the US but on reflection, the financial situation being what it is, most major studios and production houses, try to bet on a sure thing, for a greater return. No matter what, this movie is a blast to watch, so make sure you have plenty of popcorn and enjoy yourself. Oh, in case your wondering, he does take his shirt off."
B0091P60PY If you like swords and magic this movie is for you! Acting is pretty good and so is the direction!"
B0091P60PY Solomon Kane stars James Purefoy as a pirate of royal blood, who's soul is damned for hell (literally!) and becomes a self-made holy man. Now, one heck of a story could be told about this man, however this is not a character study. Instead this is another CGI over substance wonder, this one coming from Great Briain instead of Hollywood, that's a novelty I suppose.Based on the works of Robert E. HowardConan - The Complete Questthis is another tale of \"witchcraft and sorcery\", this tale begins in 1600 with Solomon working as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth 1 in North Africa, here he meets a demon who tries to take possession of his soul, it's no longer his, but property of the devil. Solomon escapes, or the movie would be a lot shorter. Once back in England he gives up his evil ways, seeks sanctuary at a church and begins a life of peace, intending to live out his days their. I guess that wasn't in god's plan, as one day, the priests boot Solomon out, I think he got until sundown to leave, because he was out of their fast.Solomon's plan seems to be to wonder the Earth, you know like Caine in Kung Fu, first day out he's besieged by a band of robbers who look escapes from one of those horror films about a family of cannibals. He's beaten and robbed, of what I'm not sure, because of his unwillingness to lay his murderer's hands upon anyone anymore.He's saved from death by a puritan family (Alice Krige and the late Pete Postelwait),their daughter Margaret (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and son Samuel (Patrick Hurd-Wood), who nurse him back to health, befriend him and give him a silly looking quaker costume.It takes nearly forty minutes to get the core of the story which comes after the family is mercilessly butcher by emissaries of the sorcerer Malicah (Jason Flemying), Margaret survives, but is abducted. Now, the sleeping beast Solomon Kane was has been awakened. Malicah, has imprisoned the people of the land, stolen the throne and has his minions turned into scared brutes. Solomon Kane, as it turns it, is the second son in the line to the throne (Howard had some belief hereos had to be of some sort of noble blood), banished years earlier by his father (Max Von Sydow), he may not have expected  a happy homecoming, but not this.Solomon Kane is s good looking production, good actors, costumes, make-up, cinematography, locations. It does sufer under the weight of it's terrible dialogue that sounds as if it was lifted directly from Howard's writing, someone actually says \"silence you dogs\" and Solomon states \"I am the only devil here\", I think you get the idea. I suspect that this movie will draw some comparison with last summer's dudJonah Hex, it is better than that, in some ways I was reminded of Bergamsn'sThe Seventh Seal: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray], and not just because of Von Sydow's cameo, and not because this is great art, but certain plot elements and a tiny bit of it's thematic structure. This in itself, I think makes it a more interesting movie.It is well known that the film has, as of yet, to find a distributor in North America, it was released theatrically in England and parts of Europe where it did poorly. It is hard to say, especially in this filmgoing climate if this is theatrical worthy. I know I liked it better than a lot of what is playing at multiplexies, however it does have a syfy channel ready approach to it, some of the CGI is not so great, Solomon Kane was shot on a budget of $45 million, not $250 million like the latest Transformers movie.  Also, today such high exposure stars as Al Pacino, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, William Hurt, Dustin Hoffman, Nick Nolte find themselves working on HBO, filmmakers like Michael Mann, Todd Philips, Paul Schrader, Curtis Hnasen, and soon, David Mamet have all directed cable movies. I find Solomon Kane to be worth a look, but where to look at it and how hard to look at it, that's another tale to tell."
B0091P60PY I highly recommend this picture. Good character who did bad things but was redeemed. I'm glad I rented this pic."
B0091P60PY Definitely worth watching. A lot of action and 15th century B.S. about God and the Devil. If it were true, they certainly could not be defeated by swords. It's worth a watch but I wouldn't set my hair on fire hurrying to get it.Dark and confusing plot. Leaves a lot of holes to the imagination.  It is all a strange Devonshire movie with heavy accents and two bit metal and amazingly accurate flintlocks, which had not been invented yet, used to kill.Generally makes no sense, but Good wins over Evil as always.  I would wait until it is Prime Free."
B0091P60PY was full of action and right up my alley.  I like to watch movies with this type of character.  Warrior, hero,...etc.  One of those movies you really do not want to end but you know its going to. I would watch it again."
B0091P60PY Solomon Kane ROCKS. Lots of Awesome Action, and Cool Special FX, and a Pretty Cool Storyline. Kind of a Much Darker Van Helsing Style film. I only wish it were a little longer. Hopefully there will be a sequel. I would love to see more. AAA+++"
B0091P60PY The film introduces 17th century super-hero Solomon Kane (James Purefoy). The opening and ending scenes are filled with special effects and sequences of a 5 star film. Unfortunately the filler isn't as great. Kane comes from a family of wealth and nobility. He rejects his role in life to establish his own, a treasure seeking killer. When the devil attempts to claim Kane's soul, Kane balks and looks for a path of redemption, one that evil forces him to leave.Unfortunately the film plunged from its opening scene. Bad guys have less of the super natural special effects and Kane fights like a normal person. His relationship with Meribeth (Rachel Hurd-Wood) sputters in its development.Makes a decent rental.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
B0091P60PY It has taken four years but Solomon Kane has finally made its way to the U.S. and the wait was worth it, as this is the best film adaptation yet of a Robert E. Howard character.  Granted, that&#8217;s not saying a whole lot given previous history.  The original 1982 Conan film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was an enjoyable but highly flawed film; it&#8217;s 1984 sequel, the 2011 reboot, and the Kull the Conqueror films do not even bear discussion in the equation.Solomon Kane may have been Howard&#8217;s greatest character.  He was certainly the late pulp writer&#8217;s most complex creation.  The Puritan adventurer was more the antithesis of Conan&#8230;a man who avoided violence but was driven by a code of strict moral ethics as opposed to Conan&#8217;s more earthly pursuits of gold, women, and ale.  Michael J. Bassett&#8217;s screenplay is not based on any of Howard&#8217;s original stories although bits and pieces are cobbled from several such as &#8220;The Moon of Skulls&#8221;, and &#8220;Blades of the Brotherhood&#8221;.While Howard never wrote Kane an origin story per se, Bassett provides his vision of Kane&#8217;s backstory.  We first meet Kane (Purefoy) in North Africa (where Howard based many of the original Kane tales) as a ruthless pirate leading his men against an Ottoman fortress.  While searching the castle for plunder, Kane encounters a hooded demon known as the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Reaper&#8221; who tells Kane his soul is doomed to Hell for his past evils.  Kane escapes the demon and we next meet him years later having found sanctuary in an English monastery.After a prophetic dream, the Abbot tells Kane he must leave to find atonement for his sins.  His travels eventually lead him to meet a Puritan family called the Crowthorns including father William (Postlethewaite), mother Katherine (Krige) daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood), along with their two sons.  While Kane is scouting ahead, the family is attacked by the corrupted soldiers of a Malachi, an evil sorcerer, Kane  The soldiers kill the Crownthorn men and kidnap Meredith.  Kane has sworn to never kill again but he is forced to break his vow to battle the evil stalking the land and rescue Meredith.Solomon Kane had less than half the budget ($40 million) versus the 2011 Conan the Barbarian film ($90 million) but you certainly cannot tell.  This is a film that uses every dime to its fullest.  It captures the bleak look of England in the early 1600s that matches the essence of the Robert E. Howard stories.  It&#8217;s dark, gray, and barren and seemingly lacking in hope and happiness.Bassett&#8217;s story overreaches somewhat by trying to be too epic in scale. The final battle against the giant fire demon (which looks way too much like a Balrog) came off as self-indulgent.  Howard&#8217;s Kane stories were decidedly smaller and regional in scale.  Kane&#8217;s stories were often personal, however, and Bassett&#8217;s screenplay does have that feel.  Kane isn&#8217;t concerned with saving the kingdom.  He only wants to fulfill his vow to the dying William Crowthorn and save his daughter.  You must credit Bassett for delivering an R rated film that seethes with the savage violence of the source material.  Heads and limbs are cleaved with regularity and without apology.Unlike Howard&#8217;s muscle-bound Conan and Kull, Kane was always described as lean but wiry. Purefoy absolutely nails Kane in every way possible.  Sure the costume department did their job with Kane&#8217;s traditional slouched hat, dark cloak, rapier, dirk, and pistols, but credit Purefoy for making Kane real.  From his voice, to his emotions and to his mannerisms, he IS Solomon Kane.  While Purefoy is outstanding in the lead role he is bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast including Postlethwaite, Krige, Jason Flemying, and Max Von Sydow (who ironically had a bit role in the 1982 Conan film) as Kane&#8217;s father.The Solomon Kane film was released in the UK in 2009 and even though it seemed to be on the literal slow boat, it has finally made its way to U.S. shores and Howard fans can finally rejoice!Blu-Ray ExtrasAudio Commentary with Michael J.

B0091P60PY \"If I kill you I am bound for Hell. It is a price I shall gladly pay.\" Solomon Kane (Purefoy) is a ruthless mercenary who has no problems with killing until a minion of the Devil appears and tells him that he in on a path to Hell if he continues. Renouncing violence, Kane changes his ways until a group he has taken up with has their child taken from them. Told the only way he can change his fortune is to bring the girl back. Now the only way to save his soul is to first set it on the path to Hell. I have never really been a fan of med-evil era movies. I'm not sure why but most have never really appealed to me. This one, while still not great was actually not that bad. Kind of a combination of The Searchers & Ghost Rider (I know). The movie is pretty much nothing more then a lot of violence and death, but it is entertaining. If you are into movies set in the dark ages and full of fighting and death you will love this. If like me you aren't into this genre you may still like it. I think it's worth watching. Overall, better then I was expecting. I give it a B-."
B0091P60PY Overall I enjoyed the story of the movie and I felt like the visuals and environment supported t
B0091P60PY I was surprised to learn after seeing Solomon Kane that it had earned such high praise from so many &#34;critics&#34;.  While I was able to sit through the whole bloody mess from beginning to end, it was a bit of a chore for me.  Having said that, it is a decent enough B-grade movie and, like many B-grade movies, eminently forgettable.  Lots of hack and slash, which I don't object to per se, it's just that Solomon Kane brings nothing new whatsoever to the table.  It's certainly not a movie I would tell anyone they should go out and see, but if someone were to ask me if it's any good, I might simply respond that it's watchable and a way to find a little entertainment of an evening."
B0091P6X2E actually a trailerwas a good couple minutes but when will it be in the theatresdeserves to be seen on the big screen"
B0091P6X2E I actually watched the movie and rated mit so I was wondering why this was here, and why it had the cover of Erased showing up. Thats a movie I have not watched. I can only imagine this is an error. The movie, Solomon Kane, is really good. I personally feel it would make a great TV series. Kane was written by Robert E Howard, who brought us Conan. It was a comic book for awhile, but the whole puritan period reminds Americans of Thanksgiving."
B0091P6X2E Amazon Instant Video released this preview before it will be shown in theaters.  With the high cost of theater visits, I was able to view this new release from the comfort of own home."
B0091P6X2E The action was grim, but we all know in our inner selves that giving up is worse than moving forward and facing all the demons that plague us."
B0091P6X2E Action-packed 8.36 minutes.  Not 10.  So, Solomon is a pirate.  A naughty, nasty, blood-thirsty pirate.  With the swordsmanship of a hero and the attitude of a scoundrel.  Until he meets the Devil's reaper.  Then all his plans just go out the window.Monsters were cool.  Special effects done well.  Characterization was limited.  Acting was excellent.  Action was entertaining.  But they never explained how Solomon's crew blew up that giant door to the keep.  It would have been nice to see a cannon or something.  As it is, as far as we know, Kane had supernatural gas.  No wonder he fears no devil.Either way, I will be watching this flick when the price lowers.  Looks like it will be an entertaining movie with limited characterization, like the last Conan."
B0092ME70Q This program was recommended to me by my brother-in-law when he learned I was interested in how people live in the harsher parts of Alaska. Wow, what a great reality show. Kind of like Swamp People but in the far, far north. I'm not thrilled by all the animals these men hunt and trap, but understand why they must do this to survive. Their village would starve to death without the meat they bring back from going on hunts in the winter, and the pelts are vital to subsidize what little money they bring in as well. This really is subsistence living, and they get by on very little. The land is everything. I also very much appreciate the Native American culture and traditions of these people, and their deep respect for nature. Ultimately, their strong sense of community is what keeps them alive. I don't get this channel so am buying the episodes as they come out. Well worth it. I'm cheering for these guys."
B0092ME70Q I love these series because although I am too old to actually participate and certainly can dream and imagine.  Humans have live this way for centuries and the magnificence of nature can overwhelm you."
B0092ME70Q I decided to try out this show because I was a faithful watcher of &#34;Flying Alaska&#34; and am one of &#34;Gold Rush Alaska.&#34;  I would love to visit Alaska someday, so I figured &#34;Yukon men&#34; could be fun to watch and see how everyone lives and the potentials for an average person to make it through the tough weather & seasonal conditions there.  Yukon Men is a show with several families that focus on how they live and try to make it in Alaska. It seems most of the men and families rely on their surroundings for food, work and day to day living.  I'm impressed with the whole towns &#34;family&#34; atmosphere, something I definetly don't see in my small town.  Everyone in the area helps each other out in times of need, and there not even kin to each other.  I enjoyed watching this program to be able to see the beautiful scenery, wilderness, animals, adventure and struggles to survive.  Once again the possiblities of an average person being able to try it out.  These people definetly have to count on their surroundings to survive.  Risking your life to hunt down large animals for food, cutting trees for burning wood to keep warm and or to sell as money/ income.  There is a difference with this particular program because of where they are living, on the Yukon River in/near Tanana, Alaska.  There definetly isn't any grocery stores around for a quick run to the store for dinner.  And each and every year their work plans include getting food, supporting their families with shelter, heat from the long cold months, going out to hunt for their food and whatever else they have to do that is planned out each and every day, month and year.  I give them a lot of credit for what they do.  You definetly don't have a &#34;job&#34; so to speak, like in the lower 48, and your lifestyle is NOT pretty.  All in all I enjoy just watching the show for all of the above."
B0092ME70Q entertaining series about the rugged and rough wilderness lifein the far north. should be priced lower or be on prime. but itis interesting. these people are living like the pioneers."
B0092ME70Q YUKON MEN ARE AWESOME!!! LOVE THIS SHOW, LOVE THE FAMILY FEEL OF IT, AND THE REAL BACK TO BASIC'S..KEEP IT UP!!!! I HOPE YOU KEEP THE SEASON'S COMING AND HOPE THAT HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT HURT AND OR RUIN THE GOOD PEOPLE OF ALASKA!!"
B0092ME70Q Man, is Kate a cutie. Fishing and hunting, trapping, the true Alaskan native survival living. Wish I could go up there and leave all this stress behind. Rock on Yukon men."
B00932ADLC I have to say I really enjoy this show. I honestly did not expect to, but once I got over the shocker in the first show, I found my self going back for another episode. It is a light comedy with great sarcastic one-liners. Both main characters play well off each other. The teens add little poignant side stories."
B00932ADLC It has a messed up story line in the beginning but wow the writers for this show and the actors perfectly mesh and make this show shine. I couldn't stop watching till I had to pay (prime account.. Bated, hooked, and Caught!!?.). Yes I will be watching the rest of this show."
B00932ADLC I highly recomend this show.  The cast has a great chemistry.  The writing is very good and I can see drama classes performing scenes from it for years and years to come.  The dancing is wonderful, and I love the story lines that intermingle with each other- from Fanny the strict ballet teacher to Michelle, to the young dancers, to their own family's struggles and disapointments- there is something for everyone.  The viewer becomes really invested in the characters as they are believable and relatable."
B00932ADLC I could not stop watching... the young actresses were super!!! there dancing to die for!!! and to see some of the cast from Gilmore Girls was great since they are great with their wit!!!!"
B00932ADLC Characters are diverse and dance is entertaining. Who would know that a series centered around ballet could be so addicting?"
B00932ADLC Very funny. Extremely fun too watch. Reminds me of my daughter and her friends at dance school. I hope there will be more."
B00932ADLC I really enjoy this series..it's decent watching..and the story lineis reasonable..But sorry there is no violence, no F etc. words andthe sex is only implied  not graphic or nsulting..in short, if you want to watch a nice relaxingand charming 1/2 hour of a good inoffensive show..this would be theone..  I like the people, the acting is excellent for the script and whenthe program was over, I was glad I found this show.."
B00932ADLC I did not think I would like it much but ended up loving it! Wish there were more seasons available!"
B00932ADLC I was drawn to this story as soon as I saw the trailer for it, but it's not the typical dancer-angst story. It is about initations, a fish out of water navigating through a strange land where people own things but don't pay their bills. The teen dancers have more on their minds than boys (or killing vampires and zombies), and each character works to find her place, to be seen, to express who she is despite her age, her situation, and her past experiences.  It has a kind of Mayberry-in-California flavor to it centering around Madame, instead of Andy or Aunt Bee. I wondering if the writers will hit their stride in the second season, now that the setting is built and the characters sketched in."
B00932ADLC A show that makes you wish you lived in the neighborhood and new these people. Not too surprising coming from the creator of Gilmore Girls that this is just as likable, fun and engaging. Too bad it obviously wasn't given the time to find it's audience. I didn't discover it until it was already off the air. A great 18 episodes."
B00932ADLC But I suppose this is great for tween girls. Or something. I was quite surprised at the general tackiness of the production value, the cheesy opening titles, and the poor quality of the writing."
B00932ADLC I am a HUGE fan of Gilmore Girls.  I own the entire series set on DVD.  I know almost ever line to every episode.  I am a GG Addict.  That being said, after a long hiatus and going through withdrawals from having no Amy Sherman-Palladino quick banter to fill my day - she announced that she was bringing Bunheads to a TV near you!At first I was skeptical.  Some of the lines were old GG lines....a great deal of the actors were old cast members of Gilmore Girls - Kelly Bishop, Sean Gunn, Rose Abodo, Alex Borestein, Chris Eigman, Liza Weil, Biff Yeager, Greg Henry, Jon Polito, Todd Lowe - just to name a few.  The banter was quick and witty - ASP hasn't lost her style for sure...So I watched the pilot and needless to say, I was not terribly impressed.  The lines were not believable coming from these sheltered girls living in Paradise CA.  There was no older mentor to give them one liners from &#34;This Is Spinal Tap&#34; and their references to pop culture were not something that this generation (depicted in Bunheads) neither cares for or knows much about (Sad).If you can look past the awkwardness of the first few episodes, the stories get better, the characters find themselves, and the girls become more believable and comfortable in their roles.  Poor Hubble gets squashed in the background as a sideline character who was nothing more than a catalyst for bringing these characters together....What I do love about this show - and it took me a GOOD while to like her - is Sutton Foster.  What a talent!!! And once I got over her not being Lorelai Gilmore, and Not being Lauren Graham, and that she was her own character in itself....I really grew to love her.  She has a good feel for her character Michelle Simms, and she plays her well.Overall, the program is GREAT.  The writing is as smart as always, the jokes are funny, the storyline has a point and the kids are just all around good kids.  The life situations are relatable, and once again, ASP has created a world in which you want to live.....After watching Bunheads, you may want to leave the comfort of Stars Hollow and venture across the country to breathe in the Sea Air in Paradise Ca....Glad to see Amy Sherman-Palladino back in the game!! She has been truly missed!  Hoping they come back for a second season!"
B00932ADLC Bunheads is one of those few shows that separated itself frommany teen shows on ABCfamily where it had fast unique dialogue and just outrightfun comedy. And sadly a diamond in the rough that only a few could seeits potential. With that in mind I recommend to any teenage girl or womanto go and give it a shot. Not many I know have gotten into it but you do &#34;Awesome!&#34;if not &#34;Well you tried&#34;.Hope this help!Good Luck!"
B00932ADLC The premise of this series is very touching and it carries well into the episodes. The acceptance of all &#34;body types&#34; and the valuing of individual gifts is very refreshing."
B00932ADLC This show is mostly for female agenda. I must admit I think when you can't find anything else on, this will satisfy anyone."
B00932ADLC How can you not love Michelle Simms? She is a singer, dancer, and has a wit that can cut through the crap faster than a hot butter knife. The girls that play the bunheads are so talented and I hope that each of them has a great career. The dance numbers at the end of most of the shows are so fantastic. I also love the fact that Jeanine Mason and Kurt from So You Think You Can Dance had great roles at the end of the series"
B00932ADLC Was a different kind of humor and I guess some people didn't understand it ... but I did and it was refreshing.  Love how the kids loved the one teacher who was having a hard time &#34;finding herself&#34; ... I really liked her myself ... and helped her alot as she helped them ... sorry to see the series end and not be picked up for further stories ... I was looking forward to it continuing."
B00932ADLC OKAY I'M HOOKED.  ARE THERE NO MORE EPISODES? LOVE THE DANCING AND CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE CAST.  I EVEN LOVED THE OLD SCHOL MUSIC THAT WAS USED.  PLEASE TELL ME THERE WILL BE MORE!!!!"
B00932ADLC I love it! I think it is a wonderful family entertainment!. Ballet and dance has become quiet popular in High Schools and in among younger students what with GLEE on T.V.I love ballet and loved the whole idea of training these 4 young high school students  through their growth as dancers and actors and their interaction with a young dancer/actor's life when she is forced into teaching was a  very poignant and powerful path. I thought this series showed  them grow and develop into closer friends,.I hope this is only the first in this series."
B00932ADLC A little more mature than I would have expected from an ABC Family show. Lots of sexual innuendo, which was a little awkward to watch the in mixed company."
B00932ADLC The show has lovable characters, a good setting , a whimsical plot , it's a show I would want my daughter to watch."
B00932ADLC Watched on the strength of its creator who was responsible for The Gilmore Girls which I thought was exceptional.  The same witty comments are heard but not delivered with same brilliance as the cast from The Gilmore Girls.  The initial premise was thin (a showgirl in Las Vegas is wooed into marrying a mundane man who actually still lives with his mother - Kelly Bishop who was Lauren Graham' s mother in The Gilmore Girls).  The showgirl inherits her husband's property when he dies only two days following the wedding.  She also inherits the studio where the mother teaches dance to a group of teenagers (the bun heads).  It is interesting enough to keep watching (seen only a few episodes so far) but hope for improvement from the ca
B00932ADLC I love this show.  The adult characters are hilarious together and when interacting with the kids.  When the kid scenes are on, I find myself waiting fo the scene to end so the adults to come back as I find the kids characters a bit annoying.  But the awesomeness of the adult characters outweighs the annoying kids."
B00932ADLC The adult characters are intended to be unusual and interesting but come across as rather shallow, rather unprincipled and predictable which doesn't make very particularly good role models for the teens. The young people are typical teens with all the problems teens have except for their great ballet dancing."
B00932ADLC A good look at one of the arts in training through daily life, humorous.  More normal than most shows especially those that go to extremes such horror and depicting murders."
B00932ADLC My wife and I have watched many of the series aired on ABC Family. Some of them are hits (Melissa and Joey), while others are decent (Happily Divorced and Baby Daddy). Bunheads takes things to a whole new level, in a good way.Premise: An aging Vegas showgirl is quickly growing tired of her life. She squandered her talents for money early on in her career. She now wishes she could pick a different path, one that would lead to a life of happiness. As it stands, she resents the other show girls who get paid more than her simply for taking their tops off. Resenting this fact, she decides to try her hand at a more serious dancing gig by auditioning for Chicago. When the director dismisses her without even seeing her routine, she is devastated and decides it is time for a change in her life.The day after the audition, an admirer of hers, Hubble, shows up with yet another gift. He has been showing up for almost a year trying to woo her. All of his attempts have failed, but this time she decides it couldn't hurt. The two of them head for drinks when Hubble proposes that they get married and live in his house on Paradise. In her drunken state she considers it, and next finds herself waking up in a car on the way to Paradise with her new husband. No recollection of what happened the night before.It turns out Hubble's mother is a dance teacher. The two dancers don't exactly click, but decide to tolerate each other. Hubble has an unfortunate accident and dies as a result, leaving his widow and mother to pick up the pieces.Verdict: This is a very well done series. The pilot episode felt more like a hallmark movie than the beginning of a series! My wife was even willing to stay up way past her normal bedtime to watch another episode, which NEVER happens because she cherishes her sleep so much. If that doesn't inspire you to watch this series, nothing will."
B00932ADLC This is a great show. I love the stories because of all the drama the girls go through and how the young ballet teacher can't help herself but too get involved in to their lives while trying to work through her own issues."
B00932ADLC The series is terrific and the best part it is free.  Free-that is-until near the end of the season then we are asked to pay 1.99 per episode.  Which may not be too bad if we hadn't paid 79.00 for the Amazon Prime.  For 6.00 more one can join Netflix and see everything Prime has and more.  Back to the series it is great."
B00932ADLC I'm not the biggest fan of ABC Family, but this show was really good! I love dancing and they had the best mix of comedy and drama with the performances that gave it great character. I would love it if it at LEAST would get to do a movie special to tie up all the loose ends you see in the season finale or series finale, however you want to look at it."
B00932ADLC I think this show would be an excellent tv show.  I like the whole cast and especially the lead.  It's a well written, honest hitting, good show."
B00932ADLC Funny, uplifting, and the dancing!  Hope there is a second season coming.  It's so nice to see  show thatis fun."
B00932ADLC This Show Is very good am hooked i already bought 3 Episodes and going to buy 2 more Later i like How Suttonr Foster Acts And she is so Pretty with or without Makeup"
B00932ADLC this is for either teenagers or adult women kind of show. I doubt most men would enjoy it. It is okay nothing great."
B00932ADLC WHY did ABC yet again cancel such an excellent show!!! I thought this show was fun, witty, entertaining and really fun to watch.  It could have run for 10 seasons it was that good!"
B00932ADLC This is the best sitcom I have experienced in years. Witty, smart, two women, with a cast of more young women! It is a gas.I watched most of the first season on Prime for free. I was shocked to see that the last 6 shows were suddenly a $1.99 a piece!I am 62, retired so that price shot that experience out of the water. I am disappointed that Amazon handled the series this way. You are watching prime for a reason. $1.99 a show is ruinous.I hope I get to see the rest of this series. It has put a sour taste in my mouth for Amazon Prime TV. Which I am sure I more than pay for by shopping through Amazon almost exculusively. I could find no where to get this complaint out in customer service.That is why I aired it here."
B00932ADLC Quote from Michelle Simms:  \"Oh little one, I have done all that you have done or shall do. Thought of all you've thought or shall think. I am all knowing; I am Michelle.\"This is a show of Michelle Simms (Sutton Foster), a has-been Broadway girl performing in Vegas where she is swept away by Hubbell Flowers (played by Alan Ruck).  This actress is quite talented.  And I love that the character's name is Michelle.  My family and I even joke about how we both have the same name.When I first watched this it was because it was by the same producers ofGilmore Girls: The Complete First Season (Digipack).  But now that I'm hooked on just the show, I've forgotten about the producers.  And up until now, I didn't pay attention to the actress that played Fanny Flowers.  I didn't compare or think of Kelly Bishop as the same person of Emily Gilmore from \"Gilmore Girls.\"These actresses stand alone just as this show does.  It's not \"Gilmore Girls\" at all. It's a good show with very talented ballet actors and great choreography.\"Every day in your house is like a Kristen Wiig Film Festival.\" - Michelle Simms."
B00932ADLC This show about the struggles (comedic) of a dance studio and it's owners in a small beach community in CA is great. Well written and excellently performed - well worth watching."
B00932ADLC This is one of these shows that I want to see more of!!!!!!!!! Not reality these are so much way better than the show on now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
B00932ADLC Lovers of Gilmore Girls no longer need despair!  A series from Amy Sherman-Paladino has arrived with the same quirky kind of characters and fast paced dialogue that won the hearts of fans for many seasons."
B00932ADLC This is a great show. The case are all very talented. The scripts are very interesting and a lot of fun."
B00932ADLC We started watching this show only because it was FREE for Amazon Prime members.  I had not heard of it before seeing it on Amazon.  I was very surprised to find it's a great show.  Even my husband enjoys it and I looked at it as a 'chick flick'.  This show revolves around a Vegas show girl who is getting too old for the stage.  There was a man who always stopped to see her when he was in town.  (Hubble) who is madly in love with her.  She ends up, in a moment of weakness she marries this man and he takes her home with him to a town called Paradise.  His mother lives with him, which he never mentioned.  She was a dancer also in her day and as a means of support she has a dance studio where she teaches teenage girls ballet.  The two lead women work well together and they are both quick witted, which lends some comedy to the show.  I highly recommend you check this show out.  I think you will not be sorry.  Hopefully this show is picked up for a second season."
B00932ADLC Funny, quirky and extremely entertaining for all ages - I hope there is another season in the works .... enjoyed every episode"
B00932ADLC I so regret that this series lasted for only 18 episodes and soon will no longer be available for streaming via Amazon Prime. I'm male and probably not in the demographic for this type of show. However, I thoroughly enjoyed at. It was funny, thoughtful and filled with characters you could be interested in. Hopefully, there will be more room on TV for these types of shows in the future and less given over to mindless, derivative violence."
B00932ADLC I wasnot sure if I would like this show but after a few shows I started to really like it . It is a great no thought required show."
B00932ADLC This is a sort of ho-hum situation comedy mixed in with some pretty good acting and decent plots.  It's not something I'd go nuts over, but something I would watch on occasion."
B00932ADLC my only wish is that it cancelled after one season.my daughter is the one who watched and was angry when she found that out"
B00932ADLC I enjoyed this show but it's not Gilmore Girls and it shouldn't try to pretend to be. The music, the actors, the nuances, the witty banter with smart references are all derivative of Gilmore Girls.  No, that's too little.  They're not derivative, they're exact copies. They didn't have to be.  The show had such potential but it didn't quite work.  It would be interesting to try it again with less Gilmoreness because the girls are quite engaging and the scripts are good.  They just need to be less Gilmore Girls and more about the girls and their dancing."
B00932ADLC I watched this show because I enjoy watching good dancing and the fast-paced, witty dialogue in shows like &#34;Gilmore Girls&#34;.  I knew this show was written by the same woman so thought I'd enjoy it.  Overall, I do enjoy it.  Some episodes are significantly funnier than others, and I wish Michelle drank a little less, but fans of &#34;Gilmore&#34; will enjoy.  I look forward to seeing the relationship between Michelle and Feeny deepen."
B00932ADLC So I thought that this show would resemble Gilmore Girls since the creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had created that show lasting seven seasons, and that the grandmother form Gilmore Girls is a central character on this show. However, I was proven wrong, this show doesn't resemble Gilmore Girls at all, it's about a Vagas show girl who teaches dance in a small town. Granted I haven't finished the first season, but it wasn't that interesting and used plot twists early on like killing off a promising romantic partner for the main character. I guess that the network differences between this show and Gilmore Girls could affect the content, but I would hope not. Anyways as a fan of Amy Sheman-Palladino I am disappointed with this show, however it could also be that I am not interested in ballerina's too. I think it's because I am not familiar with the central topic of the show, ballerina dancers. I won' t be watching this anymore, however, on my favorite show on TV, Parenthood, Gypsy's character from Gilmore Girls has a sideline character in season four/five."
B0093QLGO6 This is a hartwarming show with issues of today. Its a funny family comedy it will make you laugh with a storyline or message to evey show."
B0093QLGO6 This is a mediocre and boring show.The characters have no nuance and the actors are not helping.This is a shame.  The subject is timely and engaging.I had high hopes for this series but this is no Will and Grace.Alas."
B0093QLGO6 I was really excited about this series when it first started, but it's become rather lame and campy throughout the season.  I think it's trying too hard.  I'm glad I saw this season, but I'll not be buying any further seasons."
B0093QLGO6 if \"all in the family\" \"roseanne\" and \"will & grace\" had a baby on acid it would be lucky if it was as good as this wonderful showellen barkin shines. she is wrong often enough to be a real-life mcconservative, but like an annoyingly square grandmother, she can also be profoundly right. i'm now 6 episodes in and it continues to get better from an already impressive pilot.nene leakes alone is worth the admission. i always knew she was a thousand foot tall party, but i didnt know she could act. turns out she can and is the best supporting character in ages. i might even start watching glee just to see her.the little girl is also worth staying for. actually the whole cast is good and the writing is cutting edge and sometimes punctuates the semi-cartoon atmosphere with a moment or five that are shockingly real.love it love it love it."
B0093QLGO6 I love this show.  I think the character that Ellen Barkin plays is hilarious and the one liners are fast and furious so pay attention."
B0093QLGO6 Thought I was going to love it but it's just okay. It's like a cross of Modern Family and Raising Hope but not as quirky or as funny as either one."
B0093QLGO6 Every episode so far has made me laugh.  I also love the main characters (well, Bryan, David, Shania, and Goldie) quite dearly."
B0093QLGO6 One of the funniest epidoses ever!!Matt Bomer is sooo funny in this!!  He's adorable and charming and if you didn't love him in White Collar, you will fall in love with him in this episode.  Way too cute!!"
B00944CJRK Ok, some of the viewers might not like this film as its gory and has a lot of shaky camera effects but if you are a horror film buff, there are things to enjoy here.The film starts with a home invasion story in which a group of friends try to enter a house in order to steal a rare VHS tape, they do find tapes but which are played by them and we see them too.These tapes are disturbing and about bizarre things, events and people. There are good stories and some of them standout not only by the resourcefulness but also by the shocking twist endings. The strongest films and my personal favorites are Amateur Night, a casual pickup for sex gone horribly wrong, Second Honeymoon- a bizarre love triangle and  The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger  and its  unexpected shocking ending. I read in a review that, each of the five films fall in to a different genre of horror film, so you have a creature feature, a ghost story, a serial killer thriller, a haunted house movie and a possession film.What did not work for me was the fact that I thought that all of these five films would be linked together by a common thread. This may not be the ground breaking film that everyone has hoped for for horror film lovers it is still a decent watch and has a lot of shocks and scares."
B00944CJRK They are few and far between: Horror anthologies I actually enjoy, whether in print or video. I can count them right here: Number One: Rampo Noir. Number Two: the amazing Korean movie Horror Stories. And as of tonight&#8212;Three: V/H/S. I had no idea it was an anthology until about halfway in. Even though this was directed by a committee of styles and sensibilities, the characters all seem to live in the same world, red in tooth and claw. This really goes beyond the anthology category and is a must for anyone interested in contemporary horror. Really hoping the sequel is as good!!!"
B00944CJRK A group of vandals / thieves / videographers break into a house in order to steal a specific VHS tape. Once inside, they find the place empty, except for one room. In this room is a stack of televisions, a VCR, and an old man in a chair. This forms the wrap-around story for the events on a tape already in the VCR. VIDEO ONE has a trio of drunken pervs, out to secretly record their sexual exploits. The tables are turned on them, and they become human prey. VIDEO TWO is about a young couple on vacation. Their trip soon becomes a nightmare when someone enters their room while they sleep. On VIDEO THREE,  a group of four hikers are out for a serene walk through the woods. Unfortunately, someone / something is out to ruin their little nature walk. VIDEO FOUR is a gruesome, supernatural story told over several days, via internet video. It's a cautionary tale that is best summed up in the words, &#34;Trust no one&#34;.  VIDEO FIVE  concerns four guys and a Halloween party. Things fly out of control, and the four are plunged into a demonic night of death.  As the burglars watch the tape, they slowly realize that things are not as they appear, and that they are in big trouble. VHS is a brilliant twist on the anthology film, and succeeds in being everything that &#34;found footage&#34; movies like BLAIR WITCH PROJECT should have been! Highly recommended..."
B00944CJRK The story is lame, the filming endeavored to make this seem &#34;campy&#34; made me sea sick instead.  Come on the movies made using this style understood that at some point the camera has to stop shaking....  And the story, well honestly ordinary trash."
B00944CJRK This movie is entertaining if you go in with low expectations.If you follow horror movies you have probably been pretty hyped about this film. This movie is interesting but I don't feel lit lived up to the hype. I feel that many other viewers do, and have, disagreed with this statement.This movie feels original in its presentation and is definitely able to create some creepy scenes. One main thing to know about this movie is that it is a compilation movie. These were popular in the 70's/80's but have definitely fallen away recently. It is great to see this style of movie coming back.The individual clips have a wide range of reviews. There is at least one that is so excellent that I feel it should have its own dedicated movie. Some of the other areas are derivative of other movies, while at least one is just pointless.  I feel that the different clips are varied in length so that some are so short that its hard to really get a lot out of it. These shorts were maid by people who didn't seem to be completely married to the idea that everything involved a V/H/S and it shows, but that really shouldn't detract from your enjoyment too much.Even though I am only giving this three stars I still feel this movie was worth watching, and it was a fantastic effo
B00944CJRK V/H/S is a weird and strangely fascinating film that takes the found footage genre and raises it up a notch, as it's basically a found footage movie built upon a number of different found footage videos, with everything tied together with a twisted little bow.  For the first 15-20 minutes, you're a little unsure about what you're watching; by the end of the first little sub-story, though, you know you're in for an uncommonly wild ride through a gauntlet of dark and gory horror thrills.  Those who give up on V/H/S too early don't know what they're missing.The main storyline has us tagging along with a bunch of twenty-something hooligans who go around filming all of their acts of vandalism, robbery, assault, and other nefarious deeds.  Then one of them says he has a job that promises a most satisfactory payoff.  All they have to do is break into this old man's house and steal a certain video tape - they have no idea what is on the tape, but the third party that wants it says they'll know it when they see it.  So off they go, video camera in hand, to burgle the old guy's house.  The job seemingly gets a lot easier when they find the old man dead in his chair, facing a wall of TV monitors and video players.  That gives them the chance to go through the video tapes they do find to try and find \"the tape.\"  As it turns out, though, that's where they make their big mistake.This is when things start to get good.  Each tape features a group of strangers filming their own little adventures.  The first one, for example, features three guys who go out on the town to pick up chicks - with one of the guys wearing spy glasses to capture all the fun on video.  They manage to get a couple of girls to go home with them, but things don't go as planned from that point on.  One of the girls is really weird - both in terms of her looks and her behavior - and she is definitely not the type you want to bring home, even for a one night stand.  Then you have a travelogue of a couple's vacation out west, with some creepy moments leading up to an unexpected ending; a group of college kids' trip to an isolated lake (and you know nothing good ever comes from that scenario); a string of video chat recordings between a cute girl and her out-of town boyfriend, centering on a \"haunting\" in the girl's apartment; and, finally, a group of buddies' video of the Halloween party from hell (a word to the wise: when you go to a Halloween party, make sure you've got the right house before you go in).  Of course, in between and after each video, our gang of hooligans are unknowingly filming their own horror story for us, as well.V/H/S really offers a great new spin on the found footage genre.  The middle stories aren't as strong as the first and last ones, but there are some really good special effects throughout.  Everything is filmed on VHS tape, of course, some of them copied on top of other recordings, so we aren't talking about digital special effects here.  That being said, some of the effects are really just superb given the VHS format.  Blood, gore, and ghostly manifestations all look cheaply real rather than really cheap.  You're a little hard pressed to find any characters you like in any of these stories, but that doesn't really matter in this particular context.  The first and last videos are particularly spellbinding, while all of them have their creepy moments.  I think most horror fans, even those who dislike found footage films, will get a real kick out of V/H/S."
B00944CJRK V/H/S compensates well for low-fi production values with refreshing story concepts.  Despite all using Blair Witch diegetic camera work, the five mini-stories cover a lot of sub genres and motifs of horror.  You've got ghosts, slashers, certain supernatural creatures, eerie motels, a dash of sci-fi; the works.  The stories usually aren't perfect, but quite concise and creative---with some very inventive visual effects.  Again, this isn't a horror anthology that simply cops to the handy cam techniques of storytelling and calls it a day.  Any horror aficionado will enjoy V/H/S' cornucopia of deathly visions."
B00944CJRK Four--or is it five?--young libido cases who enjoy filming themselves committing various criminal acts are hired to break into a house where they discover an apparently dead body and a slew of old VHS tapes, each of which portrays acts that beat them at their own game. The important thing to remember is that each of the apparently unrelated, gory, disturbing, and largely supernatural episodes in the middle portions of \"V/H/S\" represents a separate VHS discovered by the characters at the beginning; i.e., this film utilizes the same \"frame-story\" (little stories within a larger story) technique that was first used by Boccaccio and Chaucer and that has been used in a host of works ever since.The sad thing is, the premise for \"V/H/S\" has real potential; unfortunately, it's largely ruined by the standard \"found footage\" cinematography. While I understand that the purpose of this is to add realism, \"V/H/S\" would be a much easier, less confusing view without the shaky camcorder that keeps zooming in on the floor or some drunken person's face. Another frustrating point is that the main \"envelope\" story is maddeningly incomplete. This film is honestly fascinating in places, but it requires a LOT of patience.Other Considerations:--Good dialogue, even though much of it's from characters who can't complete a sentence without at least one f-bomb and one \"dude!\"--The various \"Special Features\" are worth a look. The commentaries reveal a great deal about what the creators were trying to do here.--You've probably guessed as much, but lots and lots of blatant gore and nudity, even more than in other \"found footage\" flicks."
B00944CJRK what is wrong with these people, you can check this movie in Netflix, I do not recommend this movie, terrible and cheap low budget movie"
B00944CJRK V/H/S is a hybrid of the old and new traditions of horror movie where they take a good ol' fashioned anthology and mix it up with modern hand-held camera angles. Let's see how each segment did on it's own shall we?Tape 56/Main Arc: Interesting ideas that could've been executed better. A group of thugs are given a job to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape, but they don't know which one. So a random guy is assigned to watch a tape with a dead body in the room, and when each segment ends someone disappears and the dead body has moved slightly. As I said, interesting idea but not much is revealed, pretty much everything I said about it is all you see about it, so if they elaborated more on this story it could've benefited greatly.Amateur Night: A trio of dumb young guys (a prominent feature throughout V/H/S) go out on a mission to get laid, and they pick up a normal drunk chick and a very odd looking girl that has warning signs blaring all over, which the guys seem oblivious to until she's tearing one of their chest's apart. This was the highlight of V/H/S for me, with graphic violence, creepy make up, and some genuinely unsettling scenes for a horror veteran, this was a perfect segment. I'd rate this (5/5)Second Honeymoon: Interesting idea with an anti-climactic payoff. A man and wife are having their second honeymoon (hence the title) and the first scene you see is them going to a fortune teller who gives them a bad omen. After the frightening Amateur Night this was quite a let down, the only creepy scene was when they realized a woman was outside asking for a ride and loitering outside, but just because I was expecting something to happen. As the story goes on the random woman gets into their hotel and videotapes herself above them sleeping, which would be creepy if I hadn't seen Silence of the Lambs before, which did that same idea much better over 20 years ago. In the end the wife actually plotted her husband's murder and the random woman is her lesbian lover, which could've worked, except the entire conclusion was rushed and just felt like a sucker punch to the face. I know Ti West (the director) is critically acclaimed among some people but I think he just sucks, House of the Devil was completely unmemorable (oh it's vintage! NEVERMIND!) and the Innkeepers was a snooze-fest with a predictable climax. So for Ti West standards it is ok, but compared to Amateur Night it was pretty stupid. (2/5)Tuesday the 17th: Uh-oh, the segments are starting to go downhill now. Four days after Friday the 13th a group of college students go out to some isolated woods to smoke weed and flirt, while one of the girls is acting strange. Again the setup was interesting, as the video camera seems to glitch out and show random dead bodies in certain locations, but as the story progresses half the cast gets killed out of nowhere, and the last girl reveals that another group of her friends were murdered in the same location and she's now trying to catch the killer, using her current friends as bait. The catch is the killer is never clearly shown through the camera and has implied supernatural powers, all of which just didn't make sense and wasn't built up well. (1/5)The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger: Interesting idea, more of a payoff here (but not much). The whole segment is shown through Skype segments with Emily talking with her despondent boyfriend. She believes that there are ghosts in her house, and that her room is haunted while the boyfriend is trying to calm her down and promise her that she's not going crazy. This segment utilized suspense a lot better than the last two segments, especially with Emily walking around her apartment with her eyes closed instructing her boyfriend to tell her if there's anything there. Again though, the twist is straight out of the left-field, where they're in fact aliens harvesting embryos from her body, and the boyfriend is in on it, as it ends with him talking to another random girl on Skype. The twist was almost unnecessarily weird, and would've been just as effective if the boyfriend had no idea what was going on and we just watched something weird/sick happening to Emily, but at least it was ambitious and set itself up well. (3/5)10/31/98: Like the first segment, a bunch of guys are out on Halloween looking for a good time, and for whatever reason enter a seemingly vacant house looking for 'da party'. When they reach the attic they see a bunch of cult members about to sacrifice a woman, and pull her out as the cult members are grabbed by hands from the ceiling and pulled out of sight, and when the guys are escaping the house some of the craziest s*** happens in this segment, with doorknobs disappearing and crows flying out of rooms, the segment really has to be seen to be believed. Finally the guys escape the warping house and soon realize that the lady was in fact possessed and the cult members were preforming an exorcism, so she escapes the car and leaves them on train tracks for a train to wipe them out as she goes wandering the streets. The ending could've been a lot creepier but it was still a very unique and fascinating watch. (Although I'm getting tired of seeing hands come through the wall, it all started with a youtube video ((The hand demon)), then Grave Encounters did it, and now this did it, it's starting to get old). (4/5)
B00944CJRK Disclaimer: this review contains the *OPINIONS* of the reviewer.I'd been hoping for more with this, and I felt like my expectations got shot down.To start off, I'll say what I didn't like the most about this: the lack of any trace of a comprehensive story. What we have are a bunch of middle-aged guys (it's never revealed, but you get the sense they're anarchists) who, recorded (possibly accidentally) over one's own personal sex tape, record their own dangerous misdeeds (including a force flash of a young lady). Well, after a brief discussion on how they get money on a porn site for every time they get a flash recorded, one of them tells the group how they can get more money than they could imagine from finding one certain tape. What's on the tape? Why's it worth so much? Who's paying for it? Those and other questions get asked, but no real answers are given.What trace of a storyline there is in the central story, there's little more than that in each ministory. Honestly, it felt like the dialogue in each story had been crafted by college kids that didn't care about coming up with an intelligent (let alone intelligible) storyline, they just wrote what they felt like then added special effects to make it all fit. Not only excessive swearing (already making it too much like today's American horror rather than a substantial foreign horror movie), but also (in most cases) having excessive nudity (I think they only added horror elements to keep it from being labeled as \"porn\"), it already made me anxious to actually want something substantial.Well, I would rate something like this 1/2 a star rather than none at all simply for nostalgia (they did get V/H/S technicalities and tape quirks right, I'll give them that), but I'll slightly further than that. Another 1/2 star for one segment that included a decent special effect that did impress me. The forest segment where the killer couldn't be clearly seen due to being glitched out (not only visually, but also the sound was glitched to add to the atmosphere). Beyond that, all the other special effects I couldn't pretend to have the heart to enjoy.Maybe there's a chance the sequel, S-V/H/S, will be any better?"
B00944CJRK Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie but it was hyped up a lot.I was thinking it was gonna be really scary.  I usually like anthology movies but this was just lame.It's was like watching something like the Blair Witch Projects but as an anthology.This gang of guys who film stupid videos to sell online are hired to steal a VHS tape from a house.One of them ends up watching all these random tapes he finds and each of those shows its own horror story.Most of the stories were kind of lame and reminded at best of some of the crappier episodes of Freddy's Nightmares, as far as acting and writing went.  Just a lot more low budget than that show was obviously.There is one story with a killer in the woods who kind of reminds me of Jason.  There are some creepy parts there b
B00944CJRK Actually, given the same old story lines and poor acting that are typical of the genre to the point that they are destroying it, \"V/H/S\" had some interesting sub-stories (my personal favorites were the first and last ones). For me, it was rather difficult to see how the sub-stories tied in to the original premise, but I took it as what one reviewer labeled it: a POV horror anthology. Kind of a \"Creepshow\" for the \"found footage\" generation, if you will. There is still a little life left in the genre; \"V/H/S\" showed some real potential. What will be the next big thing in horror?"
B00944CJRK MY CALL:  Looking for a film that features vampire chicks, zombies, poltergeists, aliens and even has elements of a \"house movie?\"  Well, depending my interpretation of what I saw in the melee of clips from this film you may be in for all that and more...all be it in small doses.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.Episodic horror anthology meets found footage as the movie opens with random home movies of three miscreants performing a series of arrestable offenses.  They seem to do what they do purely for fun and will surely deserve whatever ill-fate that may find them by this movie's end.Somehow one of these guys was offered a smash-and-grab job to steal a videotape from someone's home.  For some truly idiotic reason--though quite convenient for this movie's concept--not one, but two of these criminals decide to videotape this crime.  They break into the house and find the owner dead in an armchair, sitting in front of half a dozen TVs that are still on, besieged by VHS videotapes.  Anyway, clearly one of these guys never saw The Ring because he happily starts watching the tapes one after the other, alone, in the room with the dead guy who was watching the tapes!  As he watches his cohorts search the rest of the house and we watch the short films that comprise this episodic anthology.  Like many such episodic horror film, the introductory story additionally moves on briefly in between the shorts with interesting developments.These short films vary substantially in film, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.  The first, fourth and fifth (out of five) short films were much better than the second and third, both of which were so mundane I'd be happier if they were altogether omitted at the expense of the film's running time.  Below is a summary of each short film.Amateur Night.  A group of frat-type guys, one with a spy-camera in his eyeglasses, go whoring around town with the ambition of getting tits on film.  The spy-wared individual, later quite inebriated, picks up a pale, squirrely, large-eyed girl (Hannah Fierman; The Vampire Diaries).  After a healthy dose of seriously drunk driving, acquaintance rape and group sex, their squirrely girl goes absolutely feral.  What ensues is purely shock cinema, as if it wasn't already testing boundaries, complete with murder sex, bloody full frontal male and female nudity, gore, and genital dismemberment.  [Spoiled by the trailer...SPOILER from here...]  This chick, which I can only describe as a cross between a rabid cat-woman and a vampire, is truly creepy, awkward, brutal, sexy and terrifying all at once.  [...to here. End SPOILER]  The story ends on a cheesy, yet appropriate note.  This was a great shock-short with very strong make-up and effects.Director: David Bruckner (The Signal) really impressed me here.  I'd love to see this as an entire movie, but I'm not sure how that would work.  Of course, I thought that about Splice, which turned out fine in my eyes.Second Honeymoon.  A young couple (Joe Swanberg and Sophia Takal) take a road trip out west.  After retiring to their hotel room for the evening a young woman (Kate Lynn Sheil) knocks on their door and requests a ride, which the couple denies.  After they fall asleep...I'm not revealing anything else about this short, not that there's much to spoil.  The couple's dynamic is entertaining to watch, but the \"horror\" of the short just wasn't there and the attempted \"shock\" at the end wasn't shocking.Director: Ti West (The ABCs of Death, The Innkeepers) disappointed me here.  He was going for ultra-creepy but delivered nothing but lame.Tuesday the 17th.  This short combined the teleporting Jason Voorhees killer concept with the Freddy Krueger dream-killer meets White Noise premise mached-up via Blair Witch's shaky video camera.  Sound bold?  Maybe too bold?  This short never had a chance to develop and the delivery was cheap, uncreative and poorly executed.  The gore was also poor, though abundant.  Want to know about the plot?  Four college kids go to a lake house.  That's right.  They go to a Cabin in the Woods and it doesn't pay off for them or the viewers.  That about covers it.Director:  Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead) got one thing right here.  Camera tricks.  They're no longer original, but they perked my interest before I lost interest in this short.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily.  A guy has a series of Skype dates with his long distance college girlfriend (the very cute Helen Rogers).  Over the course of these recorded Skype calls (even though in the film they complain that they weren't recording them--yet here some criminal is watching them on a VHS tape in a dead guy's house) they investigate her \"haunted\" apartment.  The mood is good.  The scares were decent and made me jumpy.  There is also some very effective head-turning gore.  Not really gory, but a strong sort of off-putting in a couple scenes.  The ending makes no sense and even leads us to scratch our heads and question the true genre of the short.Director:  Joel Swanberg (You're Next) did well.  I liked getting to know the characters.  I found their couple's dynamic credible and interesting in a way that served the story quite well.  And I liked that it could make me jump...sort of...internally at least.  You know what I mean?10/31/98.  Four bros go to a Halloween party.  But the house is empty.  They explore, a few odd things happen, and they find some Klan rally-exorcism-virgin sacrifice evidently transpiring in the attic.  The bros try to save the damsel under the assumption that the aggressive hillbillies rallying around her are the bad guys.  From here, what started out as a seemingly aimless short turned into a fantastically done \"house movie\" escape with cool effects, some of which felt unique to this film.  Pulse-ghost-zombie arms reaching through the walls and the floors, objects flying about, a window actually shrinks so as to create a sense that the outside world was closed off to the house's captives...  really nicely done.Director:  \"Radio Silence,\" a troupe of several young directors, impressed me.  What doesn't impress me is their troupe name, which makes it difficult for me to follow their work and upcoming projects on IMDB.Just because I disliked a couple of these shorts in no way means this wasn't a fun experience.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, we just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  Trick 'r Treat (2007), the Creepshow franchise (1982, 1987, 2006), the upcoming more scene-than-story 26-short The ABC's of Death."
B00944CJRK V/H/S is a horror anthology with 6 short horror stories (5 if you exclude the frame story). They are told in the found-footage style, but they actually try to be innovative. I don't want to go into detail for every story because they do have twists and I don't want to spoil the scares for any of you. I'll briefly go over the most memorable (my favorites): The frame story has a group of burglars that have been paid to find a specific tape in a creepy house; one story has a group of guys that try to pick up women but run into something a lot more sinister (uniquely told through a camera installed into a pair of glasses); the next is a slow-burner that follows a young couple on a second honeymoon that has a twisted ending; another story is about a \"haunted\" apartment told through a webcam chat (think: FaceTime); the final story is about a group going to a Halloween party that end up in a horrifying house told through a nanny cam in a costume.I enjoyed V/H/S because it was genuinely scary and often disturbing (especially the ending of the second story). Most of the stories are told in a unique way that give a breath of fresh air to the found-footage genre. Whether it's told through a nanny cam or a webcam conversation, the filmmakers really tried to innovate in this film. All of the stories are interesting and most have twist endings you may not be able to predict. The \"ghost\" stories had a creepy atmosphere that I really liked. Also, I should note, some stories are slow-burners (they don't have a lot of \"jump-out\" scares), and some are the opposite, so it has some variety. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the stories, except the third one; the story was definitely interesting but I didn't find it scary (it's a \"killer in the woods\" story, with a twist). I read stories about people having to leave during the movie at special screenings, but I didn't think it was THAT scary; you may get dizzy though, the camera moves around a lot during some scenes (it only really affected me twice, though).Overall, I definitely enjoyed V/H/S, especially being a big fan of horror anthologies. I can't really recommend most movie rentals for $9.99 since it is expensive for a rental, but I can recommend this movie for hardcore fans. Also, the trailers for this film and the Wiki page have a lot of spoilers.V/H/S has strong violence and gore, intense horror sequences, excessive nudity and sex (includes full male and female nudity.)"
B00944CJRK Possible Spoliers\"V/H/S\" so some filmmakers pull various pranks on people they pass by, like attacking girls and exposing their chests to the camera and well.... that's about the extent of their \"talents\" and \"skills. These filmmakers were hired by a guy or girl or could be a crazy koala bear for all I know, to break into an old guys house and find some rare tape, (at least that's what's provided in the description of the film, never made fully clear to the viewer). They find said old guy dead and a bunch of tapes, which as they progress become more disturbing. Before and after each segment we see footage of these guys searching for this tape.The first is \"Amateur Night\" where we have 3 guys, 2 girls, bars, later a hotel room and well some bad ends for everyone involved. One of the girls is a quiet, goth like one who keeps saying to one of the guys, \"I like you\". The moral here, turns out it's true that you really need to watch out for the quiet ones.The second one is \"Second Honeymoon\" where a young couple is in a hotel room, after a knock on the door the husband says some girl asked them for a ride the next day. Then after falling asleep, the camera is back on and someone is filming both of them, taking money from the guy's wallet. There's not much more to this one as things end quickly.The third one is \"Tuesday The 17th\", now we have a camping trip where 3 friends end up as bait for a girl with them named Wendy. There's apparently some killer who is very hard to see even if he's right in front of you. Violence and bad editing galore in this one.The fourth installment is \"The Sick Thing That Happened To Emily When She Was Younger\", Emily and her boyfriend are trying to find out why ghostlike figures are appearing in her apartment and what's with a strange bump on her arm. Guess what follows? A whole lot of lameness honestly and things don't end well for Emily.The fifth and thankfully final segment is \"10/31/98\", a halloween night sees 4 guys in costume, an arrival at the wrong party house, a cult ritual and a bad end for said guys.The concept honestly sounds a lot more interesting than when it plays out, there's nothing very scary in it, the film feels way too long and the whole VHS style editing and feel really gets old and fast. The only plus is there are some very pretty girls in it, including the girl who played the quiet one in \"Amateur Night\". I'll never think of the words \"I like you\" in the same way again. But this 
B00944CJRK This will depend on your alcohol tolerance, so adjust from the base line (up) if you are a drunk. First, if you are a non to light drinker, drink one-half of a fifth of some cheap whiskey. Wait 30 minutes. Now, stand up and spin around in a circle 40 times. Without taking a break, drive to Wallmart and run up and down the isles. That is what you feel like if you watch this disorienting movie. You should also remember that VHS video looks like crap nowadays, so don't expect too much from that aspect either. Don't pay $10 to see this early, if you feel like you have to see it, wait till its about $1.99 to rent so you won't feel robbed when you turn it off after 30 minutes."
B00944CJRK The hand held video as movie concept should have died with Blair Witch, but it must be cheaper to put together nonsense like this rather than take the time to craft a really good anthology series. Don't get me wrong. There are some good ideas that could work in the hands of better directors and writers.  Getting past the first 15 (eternity) minutes to try to set up this movie is the real torture.  If it wasn't on NetFlix (which has become the dumping ground for bad movies), I would have quit watching.  But since I could simply leave it running while catching up with the local news, I allowed it to continue.  If you really want to know what happens in this movie (with all \"spoilers\"), go to the Wikipedia listing ([...]).  The listing is like a movie trailer.  Believe me, all the good parts are in the synopsis and you don't need to waste time watching this movie. If you do watch it, use the Wiki listing to find out exactly what's going on.  Oh, I know there are some reviewers here who think this is high art and the future of horror.  Don't believe it.  You want a good anthology?  Go view Hammers' \"Dr. Terror House of Horrors\". There you'll find good acting and good stories.  The only horrors in VHS are the directing, acting, and writing.  And you know VHS 2 is just around the corner."
B00944CJRK i had really high expectations for this movie. gotta admit that trailer is amazing. huge horror fan here and the buzz about this movie had me psyched....rented this movie early for the ten bucks, and will say that i feel it was a worthwhile rental, i wont be seeing it again or have the need to.five films. just like creepshow....but all found footage. interesting and pretty well done.gotta say though that out of the 5 stories, only 2 were really any good ( first and last ) ....the third and fourth were awful. no seriously. the acting was insanely bad, like, please kill these people now, bad... the second story was merely entertaining.also...the whole 'people got sick, beware when watching this movie' is hokey and has been done before and better.needless nudity completely takes away from the stories. not a buzz kill....just a fact.some interesting scares but the hype is not warranted....save your money for I Saw The Devil....now THAT is a MOVIE.fun rental but you can wait till its cheaper....not missing anything here but still fun."
B00944CJRK Having just watched the \"Blair Witch Project\" and \"The Devil Inside\", I've become acclimated to mockumentaries of horrifying occurrences, along with the liberal use of the \"f\" word by the actors to get through almost every sentence.  This film was similar to BWP/TDI but a lot more graphic, leaving very little to the imagination.  Other reviewers have already described the different vignettes that are not related except that they were all left behind by the dead man and they all depict scary/horrific acts committed on ordinary, clueless people.  They're like a series of fake snuff films, with no socially redeeming value whatsoever.  They're just intended to shock.  You have to be under 30 to enjoy this film, if you can even use that word.  I'm not by a long shot."
B00944CJRK The great thing about anthology films is that, if one of the segments falls flat, you usually don't have to wait too long to get another shot at a decent story. Even better, anthology horrors can side-step one of the biggest problems with the horror genre: the fact that scares tend to stale when you stretch a tale out to feature movie length. Much like some of the scariest campfire stories you heard when you were younger, really scary flicks don't have to be much longer than twenty minutes to pack a wallop, and they have the added benefit of being less likely to drag.That's in theory.V/H/S might have worked a lot better if it hadn't gone for the found-footage theme, a film-making style that continues to plague theaters and films. The idea is that, if you put the movie behind the lens of a home video, viewers will be more inclined to invest in the reality of a story, to feel its presence and immediacy, and therefore to be more drawn into the drama or -- in this case -- chills. What usually ends up happening, however, is the screenwriters have to struggle through exposition heavy dialogue (often regarding why the event in question is being meticulously filmed), and viewers have to deal with shaky, amateur-style filming. Luckily, the short length of these vignettes made camera excuses easy to come by, but this is without question an example of some of the worst blurry/shaky/look-how-headachingly-real-this-handheld-look-is filming I've seen in a found footage movie.There are six tales:TAPE 56: This story provides the connective tissue for the whole movie. A group of hooligans who like filming themselves are hired to go to a strange house and procure a VHS tape. During their search, they watch some of the tapes they find in the house, all of which comprise our anthology. This segment is poorly acted and even more poorly written, but that's mildly excusable given that it only exists to be connective tissue for the other bits. (1 star)AMATEUR NIGHT: A story that could've been told in about five minutes, this little bit is about three young bucks who go out on the town to pick up some chicks and make a little hidden camera porn. Needless to say, they pick up more than they bargain for. The lead actress in this bit is a real trooper and does a bang-up job, and the special effects aren't too shabby. Our three male leads, however, are annoying beyond belief, and t
B00944CJRK It's hard to make a truly scary horror film these days. Nearly every aspect of the genre has been touched on at one time or another. To find something new, fresh and scary is almost impossible. And yet some directors have accomplished this. Some have simply gone back to recreate old scares or make sequels to other famous ones. And then there are those that remember what it was like to go to a video store, to see those clamshell or oversized boxes on the shelf with creepy images and titles. Some of those film makers have come together and unleashed a tribute of sort to those days called V/H/S.The film is comprised of several stories with a connecting story that is perhaps the weakest of them all. A group of trouble makers is hired to steal a VHS tape from a house they've been told is safe. Don't let the first minutes of this movie stop you from going on. It's nothing more than showing what idiots these guys are. When they get to the house they find a dead body in a chair upstairs sitting in front of a TV with nothing more than snow showing. Around the TV stand are a number of tapes. While several members go looking for a special tape, one stays behind to start going through these. As he watches, we're allowed to see what is on the tapes as well.The first story is one of my favorites. It shows three friends on a mission to help the geekiest one lose his virginity. They've rigged his glasses up with tiny cameras so he can capture the entire night on tape. At the local bar they hook up with two drunken girls but only one of these two goes back to their hotel with them. Also going back with them is a strange girl who keeps telling the geek \"I like you\". What happens when they get back must be seen rather than described and offers one of the real scary moments in the film.Another story follows a young couple traveling across country and filming as they go. Without noticing it appears someone is following them. When they awake to find someone in their motel room the horror is revealed.A third story has a group of friends going out for a picnic in the woods. Once there they tell the story of a group of friends that was murdered in those very same woods. Of course as with all these stories one has a camera and for some reason a glitch keeps distorting the picture. Each time it does a strange and horrifying figure appears.A fourth story involves a young woman who is chatting online to a friend found elsewhere. Their conversations have them talking back and forth and as is often the case, never realizing what is going on around them. When some scary figures turn up behind the girl as she talks, we get a chill as we wait to find out what happens.The final set piece involves a group of friends out and about sent to a house in the country. When they arrive they first find no one but after checking out the house they discover a secret ceremony going on in the attic. But just who is being killed and who needs saved isn't apparent from the start.Rounding out these stories is the main one with the search for the mysterious VHS tape going on. While each film here falls into the category of lost footage tapes, not all are truly scary and the connecting device falls short of being done as well as the separate stories. The first time I watched this I was honestly a bit bored and waiting for something to happen. The second time I enjoyed it more and took a bit more time to watch what was happening. As I said once you get past the first portion of the film it picks up speed.The one thing that did damage to this film was the hype surrounding it. Before it was released word was hitting the internet that this film was the scariest thing seen in years. Fan film fest were heaping praise on it and several of the directors involved had done some great films that came out prior to this one leaving expectations high. Each segment was done by a different director which would explain the look of each tape being different. Unfortunately each director did not live up to expectations.But there are enough scares here to keep you awake and enough memorable moments that might cause you to lose sleep if you think about them too much. You can't hold the look of the film against it since this is supposed to be a lost then found video and even taking that into consideration it does have a nice look to it for the most part. Horror fans will want to make sure and give this one a watch. Others might get a few good goose bumps from it."
B00944CJRK I know it&#8217;s not traditional to review the first of a series after you&#8217;ve already reviewed the sequel...but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing with V/H/S.  About a month ago, I reviewed V/H/S/2, which I really enjoyed, partly because you don&#8217;t have to have seen the first one to know what&#8217;s going on.  Likewise, the first V/H/S is very entertaining and well done, however I have to confess that I do like the second one better.  But that should not dissuade you from checking this one out.  V/H/S is a ground-breaking horror film and it deserves a spot in every genre fan&#8217;s library!Just like it&#8217;s sequel, V/H/S is a non-traditional horror flick.  It is a compilation of short films, all shot from a first-person perspective, that all blend in with the main storyline.  The short films are not related, except that they are all smaller pieces to the bigger plot.  But again, this diversity is part of what makes the film so much fun.Unlike the second one, this film actually uses the main plot-line in a more terrifying fashion.  I will not go into great detail, but I will say that the main storyline is just as horrific as the individual shorts.  It even made me jump at one point, which is a true testament to the quality of any horror film.Probably my favorite short in V/H/S is the first one, titled &#8220;Amateur Night&#8221;.  In this film, three guys rent a hotel room with the hopes of bringing girls back for sex.  Their main focus is for the nerdier of their group, Clint, to score.  They outfit him with glasses that have a spy-cam attached so he can record his exploit.  Unfortunately, the girl he picks out is not quite what she seems, and the events that follow are like nothing you&#8217;ve ever seen before.But although I really liked V/H/S, I think I enjoyed the sequel more.  It feels like the production crew took things up several notches in the second one, including more intensity and even bigger scares.  However, I highly recommend this first film as a compliment to seeing the second one.  Both are definite Must Owns for your collection, and I suggest you check them both out soon.  They are available now in a variety of formats."
B00944CJRK &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; is one of those movies that simply shouldn&#8217;t work.  For one, a Video Home System (VHS) is a quaintly outdated technology, along the lines of the Atari 2600.  Kids today have no idea what it means to &#8220;tape&#8221; something since nothing is actually on tape.  But that&#8217;s irrelevant, because &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; mines that nostalgia for its creep factor &#8211; that&#8217;s right, modern horror movies now treat VHS like 80s horror movies treated black-and-white films.  Don&#8217;t you feel old?&#8220;V/H/S&#8221; is essentially a short story collection of horror tales, similar to &#8220;Tales from the Crypt.&#8221; The difference is that the films are each &#8220;found footage&#8221; &#8211; the premise being that these are movies someone could make themselves  &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; does acrobatics to make this premise work, but if you can look past that, it&#8217;s actually a creepy collection of horror stories.The framing story, &#8220;Tape 56,&#8221; makes no bones about its protagonists &#8211; unlike typical Stephen King films where being slovenly or rude is grounds to be eaten by a monster, the reality film crew who decides to take on this job to find tape 56 are bottom-feeding scum who assault women by tearing off their tops and filming it.  They are, in essence, the oozing reality of the nastiest part of the Internet. With no morals to speak of, they eagerly take on a high-paying job to break into a house to retrieve tape 56, only to discover an old man dead before a bank of televisions screens filled with white noise. Of course, the old man isn&#8217;t quite as dead as they believe, and in an effort to find the tape the various criminals (geniuses all) play the tapes, alone with the dead body, to see if they can find the right tape. SPOILER ALERT: This is a terrible idea.A crook plunks in a video, a blue screen winds up, and we&#8217;re off to our first short story, &#8220;Amateur Night.&#8221;  This little film, one of the better ones, features another icky plot: Clint (said amateur) is wearing spycam glasses that record his every move with the intent of creating amateur porn by getting women drunk and taking them back to a hotel. They get more than they bargained for with Lily, who really, really likes Clint.  This is a standard femme fatale film that rises above its source material because it&#8217;s not afraid to delve into the squick of amateur porn.&#8220;Second Honeymoon&#8221; features a couple on a road trip, Sam and Stephanie. After a mysterious female stranger asks Sam for a ride and he rebuffs her, we see the camcorder turned on the sleeping arguments and menaced with a knife (among other nasty things). The twist ending may catch some viewers by surprise.&#8220;Tuesday the 17th&#8221; features three friends and archetypes &#8211; Joey, Spider, Samantha, and Wendy &#8211; on a camping trip that retraces the steps of a mass murder the previous year.  It turns out one of the members is actually playing a cat-and-mouse game with the slasher, who still haunts the grounds, and what could easily be a rehash of &#8220;H20&#8221; turns into a thrilling battle of wits and grainy video effects.&#8220;The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily when She Was Younger&#8221; is an intriguing premise between Emily, who believes she is slowly losing her mind, and James, her boyfriend who also happens to be a doctor. Their video chats slowly get more and more strange, beginning with a haunting and becoming much worse than that.  This segment is filled with so many plot twists it threatens to unravel, but the shocking conclusion (and the complicity of its antagonist) works well.&#8220;10/31/98&#8221; features Chad, Matt, Tyler, and Paul dressed up in the late 90s for a Halloween party.  They end up at the wrong place and stumble upon a human sacrifice. Thinking at first this is all part of a haunted house &#8211; milked for considerable laughs &#8211; the Scooby gang finally realizes it&#8217;s not a joke and start taking things seriously. They try to rescue the sacrifice in question, to their ultimate detriment.&#8220;V/H/S&#8217;s&#8221; quality is determined by its short films, and although they are a little uneven, there&#8217;s not a stinker in the bunch. If there&#8217;s a weak point, it&#8217;s the overarching narrative, filled with nonsensical rationale and stupid victims.  But since they had it coming, and the collected videos are so good, it&#8217;s easy to overlook."
B00944CJRK First off, let me say, I am not a fan of hand held first person POV movies. It started off with the Blair Witch Project, and I have hated films like it ever since. But something about the trailer to this one looked interesting, and I'm glad I didn't turn my nose up at this one now. V/H/S starts off with the POV cam type of thing where a few guys are smashing things up, and preying on women by ganging up on her and forcing her to allow them to expose her body on cam. I think it was something about them getting paid to do that for money to sell it to internet site perverts and sickos, or something about that. I have a feeling this might be why so many reviews here are for 1 star, because at this point of the movie I was ready to turn it off too and dismiss this as being a POS if this was what the movie was going to be about.Luckily I held in there and got past that crap, and the story gets better as these guys are asked to break into a house somewhere and steal a VHS tape. These idiots record themselves doing this, but that's when this thing starts to get better. As a couple of the guys explore this house looking for a specific tape, another one is left to view what tapes have been left around to try and figure out which tape it is this person who has asked for it wants.One by one they start watching a tape left in this house, and it then shows the footage of what is on the tapes. Each tape is something different, that is horrific, weird and paranormal. It's kind of like little short horror movies, each being different, but each being shot from a hand held camera, or vacation type of video.It ranges from a couple of voyeurs who try to expose the wrong girl, to a couple on vacation who probably should have given a kid a ride, next is a Blair Witch knock off of a killer who can't be filmed for some reason, to a haunted house where something strange is happening upstairs. I think there was more?Overall, by the end of the film, I thought it was a pretty decent movie. It didn't try to claim the footage was supposedly real, so I went in without that seed of wanting to roll my eyes at everything and say &#34;who are these filmmakers trying to kid?&#34; but surprisingly I'm saying the opposite to what I often think of a lot of movies, and that is the first half of this movie is not so great, but the second half picks up and really goes full steam ahead with some decent short stories.the end scene is a bit of a let down, as it pretty much had the same ending as Blair Witch, which by the way, did I mention I fricken hate that #1 over-hyped P.O.S? Or does #1 go to Paranormal Activity? Hmmm... hard choice. So by saying that, if you too hated those movies, and these Cloverfield kind of shot films, then take my word and just give this one a go. Maybe skip the first 10 minutes or so, it's useless footage if you ask me, but once the ball starts rolling, you might be like me and actually find that there is a lot more here then just an attempt at a cheaply made movie. I don't think this one was as cheap as some people might think?Actually, I think I know what it is that makes me like this more than the other ones I mentioned now... it's probably because it actually shows things, whether it be by SFX, CGI or camera tricks, at least they show you kills, ghosts, and decent FX shots. Unlike Blair Witch or P.A movies where you expect to see something, and there is nothing there to see but someone being thrown across the screen on wires and you are expected to be scared simply by noise effects and screaming. This one shows the lot, and is an enjoyable ride to the end.Give a rent or DL at least before dismissing it as just another cheap attempt at low budget horror."
B00944CJRK I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar.  House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially.  His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid.  The remainder of them were straight up craptastic.  I paid $8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out.  I actually turned it off before finishing it.  I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $0.  My friend bought it (he is bummed by the mistake) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something...nope...hated it!"
B00944CJRK Here we go again with the \"found footage\" style of filmmaking.  Not surprising, it's also a horror film.  What is a bit different is that it is stitched together as 6 different stories by different actors, directors and plots.  The opening sequence is the segment from which the other's feed.  We have 4 punk guys who get their jollies by molesting strangers and destroying property.  They make a few bucks as minor league burglars.They are hired to retrieve a tape from rundown house in the middle of nowhere.  They find an old man, apparently dead, sitting in an easy chair in front of a bank of TV's and some VCR players.  As they search the dark, creepy house for the tape they need, one of dudes parks himself in front of the TV and plops in one of the tapes littering the room.  Thus the vignettes begin.After each segment ends, we return to the punks still looking for the right tape.  In spite of differing stories, each film has some common elements.  All of the characters are unlikeable 20 somethings.  The dudes are decent looking but the type most people would avoid at all costs.  In other words, we hope they get what they deserve.  The ladies are all attractive with generous fleshy breasts that are thoughtfully bared for the camera.There are plenty of blood splatterings, throat slashings and disemboweling to keep fans of the genre happy.  In all honesty, they were all pretty well made and acted.  The problem is that there's not much new either and the shaky cam is beyond annoying. As you might expect, the characters are also very stupid.  The film runs long at nearly 2 hours.  I've got to stop watching these \"found footage\" films."
B00944CJRK This was a horrible waste of $9.99 for a \"pre-theatrical\" rental.  If this movie ever comes out in a theater, I'd be quite shocked more by that than anything in the movie.It was so stupid and poorly done on all levels, that I watched most of it on FF just to get through it in case somehow all this tied together with something more than the ending it did have.As someone else aptly put in the title of their review...\"This movie sucks\".  I agree.But to each their own.I've seen several posts praising this movie for being \"daring\", \"innovative\", \"superb\" even.  Did we watch the same movie?!?!  Wow!Now THAT would be a terrific gimmick...Different movies all under the same title, and a random pick by a computer which one you actually get to see.  This way you'd have to find out how many different ones there are, and then hope you rent enough times to see them all.  I'm fairly certain the movie \"Clue\" did something like this in the theaters each having different endings of \"whodunit\".  The DVD shows all the endings the movie actually had.  Now that was a well done fun movie based off of a fun board game.There ya have it...simple and to the point.  Let's see how many call me names for writing this review?I guess based on those other reviews we'll all just have to wait until Hollywood finds a well-written horror comic book to make into the next awesome movie.  Why not do a GOOD Vampirella movie since we've got the whole supernatural being thing going hot & heavy with True Blood, Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries, etc., etc.  The original was terrible, but it is a cult classic.  Just sayin'..."
B00944CJRK I really could not watch.  Not my kind of movie.  It must be some sort of reality based film, couldn't get through more than five minutes."
B00944CJRK V/H/S (Adam Wingard et al., 2012)Everyone and their mothers has already weighed in on V/H/S, and they have all said the same thing: \"it's too damn long.\" Add my voice to the chorus; this is a two-hour movie that should have been 1:40 tops. Bloody-disgusting's Brad Miska, who put the whole thing together, didn't feel the need (or have the know-how, I'm not sure which) to cut this down to a length where it would have worked. That's a shame, because a number of talented directors turned in halfway decent work here, and some of it would have benefitted from a bit of trimming.First off, there's Adam Wingard's framing device, \"Tape 56.\" This had the most egregious material; we could have easily lost half of the beginning segment without losing anything from the movie at all. The story involves a bunch of roustabouts who break into a house in order to steal a videotape; they find the owner dead and a whole lot of tapes, and have no idea which one they're supposed to grab, necessitating them watching a whole lot of them.Then comes \"Amateur Night\", directed by David Bruckner (The Signal). Given how much I enjoyed The Signal, I'm disappointed to report this is the weakest entry in the lot, lacking Bruckner's humor and insight; it could have easily found its way to the cutting room floor complete. Bruckner does good work, he just didn't do it here.\"Second Honeymoon\" is the entry from Ti West (The House of the Devil), the most accomplished filmmaker of the bunch. And up until the final few minutes, this tale of a married couple being stalked by a mysterious figure on a roadtrip is the best of the bunch; unfortunately, the \"twist\" ending is just ludicrous. While the rest of the short is of Innkeepers quality, the ending is The Roost quality. And Ti West is a filmmaker who should never, ever go back and revisit his roots.Then comes Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead)'s \"Tuesday the 17th\", in which a group of friends goes out to the woods to have a good time and finds themselves stalked by a seemingly otherworldly serial killer. It's not a bad concept, and it's not bad execution, though it's nowhere near as good as I Sell the Dead, McQuaid's sole feature-length release to date. This is one where judicious editing could have helped, but given the rest of the segments here, this one comes off as middle-of-the-road; it's not great, but it's not as bad as a few of these.Next, \"The Sick Thing that Happened to Emily When She Was Younger\", helmed by Joe Swanberg (the male lead in \"Second Honeymoon\"); this is the one where it's most obvious a firmer hand in the cutting room would have been a great idea. Trimmed by even a few minutes, especially at the end, this would have easily been the movie's creepiest, most effective tale, about a girl who believes her apartment is haunted, told completely through Skype sessions with her husband, who's away on business. Excellent stuff that suffers from a lack of pacing throughout and a truly weak ending (had it stopped about three minutes before it does, it would have had much greater impact). Swanberg (Kissing on the Mouth) is a director with a great deal of potential, but like any director, he needs to get the right crew working with him, and he didn't have the right editor on this one.Finally, the four-man team known as Radio Silence turn in \"10/31/98\", the best short here, about a group of friends who misread the address on an invitation and end up going to the wrong house indeed looking for a Halloween party. These guys did their own editorial work, and they did it very well; this is the best-paced segment of the bunch by far (though it probably still could have lost a minute or two towards the beginning), tight, funny when it's supposed to be and tense the rest of the time. A little predictable once you get to the meat of the story, but the journey, not the destination, is the thing here.It certainly doesn't live up to all the hype, and I sincerely hope Miska, who is already wrapping up the sequel (S-VHS), learned from the mistakes that were made with this one. On the other hand, it's not as bad as you've heard, if you ignore the hype and go into it with no expectations. It certainly could have been miles worse. ** "
B00944CJRK I've heard some good reviews from other sites about this movie..that is why I got the time to watch it and judge it my self. Well, from my point of view, this movie has:- Few new elements (at least for me).- Fair scattered scares (jumps) in different portions (different stories!!) of this movie.- Majority of acting is fair but not good.- Some scares are of the type that can creeps you out.- Lot of unnecessary elements and scenes that got me bored.
B00944CJRK I love horror movies, and I love anthologies, AND I even love found-footage stuff. Sadly, this is pretty lame.For one thing, it's possible to do horror without having the entire cast of characters be un-relateable douches. Not here, though. Everyone is grating, obnoxious, and obtusely stupid. The first story is so full of screaming and shaking the camera that it's nearly unwatchable. The wraparound story is likewise bad (and it's a cast of douches).Sure, it's somewhat inventive, but you're better off going to watch an hour and a half of amateur stuff on YouTube (there will be less camera shaking and OMG-I-HAVE-A-CAMERA LET ME ZOOM IN ON EVERYTHING idiocy).Pass."
B00944CJRK This may look like your ordinary weekly cheap horror release as there are so many of them but V/H/S is actually a very good, clever movie and one of the years best, its directed by several known people from the genre including Ti West (the innkeepers, house of the devil)who is very good at what he does, the movie is a found footage film which will probably put people off but please give it a chance!!, the entire movie is made up of footage from peoples cameras who all fall foul to some kind of bizarre event that leads to their death, its allot more original than your average movie of this kind and does incorporate some brilliant effects and some quite hardcore violence at times, it gives off a very scary vibe too at times with each segment being very unique, this is a film not to be missed by horror fans, the movie also runs at just under 2hrs too which is pretty good for this type of movie. Make sure you check it out."
B00944CJRK For a lot of people around a certain age our first experience with gory horror films were through old video tapes, sometimes of dubious quality, that hold cherished memories of our wayward youth and that particular moment when our fragile little minds were warped for good. So the concept of a horror anthology played out through the home video revolution of yore, is something of an inspired idea, however ideas are good, execution is where it is made or broken and unfortunately V/H/S  is a very mixed bag of treats, but mostly tricks.For me the found footage genre ran out of scares a Paranormal Activity or two back,this genre has been successful by promising less than it delivers. Some have been better than others, the Last Exorcism, Diary of the Dead and the original Paranormal Activity were all very good and effective little movies. V/H/S isn't quite in that league, but at times it is one of the better  examples of the genre, and at others it is the exemplar of everything that is wrong with it.Things get off to a fairly lousy start by having a wrap around story that is dull, uninvolving and rather intrusive on latter parts of the movie. There are five short films, about twenty minutes each, I guess because the whole endeavor runs an excessive two hours. As it is about half of it works pretty well, another quarter is just okay, while the other quarter is just plain awful.Most of the stories are a little vague, some are rather incoherent, nearly all these stories are filmed on digital, which begs the question why were they transferred onto VHS tapes in the first place. The principal characters are pretty well all douche bags and incredibly stupid, there isn't sympathetic or identifiable person in the whole film. The shaky camera photography is supposed to look like s*** and it succeeds. There is a lot more talk than action, sometimes the screen actually goes blank.Some of these shorts are made by very talented young filmmakers, Ti West is one of them. West has directed the exceptionally good old school horror movies the House of the Devil and the Innkeepers. Also David Bruckner did the solid creepfest the Signal and director Glenn McQuaid gave us the joyously lugubrious I Sell the Dead. I have no idea which films belong to whom because they all look like they came from the same quasi-talented filmmaker.I love horror movies and the anthology is one of my favorite formats, it's good to see it brought out again, there aren't enough of them any more I`m sucker for this Tales From the Crpyt/Creepshow/Tales of Terror kind of scary movie. However, this looks like a bad flick on a poor quality tape, which I saw on high definition satellite television, bringing us full circle. If I had it on video I would have fast foreword a good deal of it.There is a fair amount of blood and gore and plentiful female nudity throughout the movie to keep our interest, and pretty much like everything else here it is only occasional succeeds. The acting is decent, I assume these are all professional performers, but a few are questionable. There are a few substantial scary moments and a couple of good jolts, but there is a lot to wade through here. I'm not sure it is worth the effort for anyone who is not the most ardent fan of such of things to begin with.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B00944CJRK I have to say that its been a good while since I have seen a truly scary, macabre, and wonderfully written horror film. V/H/S/ is about a group of hoodlums taping their acts of depravacy on women, destroying property, and one main job that sets the film in motion. They are contracted by a mysterious person that wants them to do a job for him. And their doomed task is to break into a house in the outskirts of town and steal a vhs tape for him. But little do they know this tape is nothing as expected it is a tape of five short but grueling point of view scenes. The first film called Amateur Night is probably the best in the movie but really I love four of the five scenes. Amateur Night is about 3 guys going out to clubs to find some women and one of the fellas has spy cam glasses on to film the guys cherades and end up picking up 2 women to bring back to their hotel room to film them having sex with the two girls but one of the girls is one wicked demon vampire maneater. thats all I am saying of the first scene. The second scene titled 2 honeymoons has one of the best twists I have scene in a while, where a newly married couple are traveling to their last spot on the trip in the midwest. They get a room for a couple of nights and a mysterious women that asks for their help turns out to be more than one had bargained for. Now, for the 3rd scene titled Tuesday the 17th a group of 4 young adults go to a swimming pond in the woods are hunted down viciously by a sadistic murderer that had killed 4 other youngsters in the past. This one is very violent but a one of a kind slasher short film. The 4th scene and I am sorry but cannot remember the title now to it, is about a women is being haunted by something in her newly rented abode. The whole scene is the woman talking by webcam with her boyfriend and lets him help her try to find out what they want and try to get her through each horrifying incedent. But, are they ghosts or something else. This scene is my least favorite but it is still very unique and very watchable. The fifth and final scene is titled 10/30/98 and is about four friends going to a halloween party. But when they arrive at their destination are they at the right spot and why is the house totally empty except a few apparitions very quickly seen on the camera they bring with them. But they finally find the party and all hell breaks loose literally. The hoodlums at the beginning of the film that finds the tape has a pretty neat twist. Will they get out with their tape and score some good money or is their fate doomed. You will just have to watch to find out. The title to the hoodlums scene is titled Tape #53. O.K. now about what I think about it is this is one of the best scary films I have seen in a while, well at least in the past 2 to 5 years. Each story has a different crew workig on it not to mention some directors that are going to frighten for for a long time. Most of the stories are very violent in one way or another, and 3 of the 5 are some of the best and truly shocking endings you will never ever see coming. It is about time a horror film has come out in the 21st century that will gice nightmares. Sweet dreams ladies and gents."
B00944CJRK For those who love shaky fake found footage, this one is da bomb. A group of criminals film their escapades of vandalism and assaults to sell to a buyer. They then enter a house to get a VHS tape, they will know it when they see it. The rest of the movie shows us found footage film within a found footage film. Oh joy. There is a dead man in the house sitting in front of a series of TVs. Each hooligan watches a film segment, then disappears from the movie. The film segments are not connected, i.e. there is no real common theme other than it is more snuff than horror with a different type of monster/entity in each piece.The final installment, I thought had the best special effects, but with the jerky camera motion and people screaming makes it difficult to enjoy any of it.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and plenty of nudity, including full frontal (Hannah Fierman)."
B00944CJRK \"We have to break into this house and all we have to do is steal this one VHS tape.\" This review will be a little different then the others I have done. This will be different because the movie was different. This first off isn't really a movie at all. They try to put a little plot in but the movie is more like a \"Tales From The Crypt\" type style where there 5 little movies that aren't connected to each other instead of one long flowing movie. The 1st one is nothing but sex and gore. the 2nd is \"Paranormal Activity\" like. 3rd one is a generic college kids on a getaway movie. 4th is a haunted house seen from a Skype point of view and the 5th is like a Twilight Zone type. Everyone of of these little movies started off OK but everyone had an anti-climatic ending and left you more and more disappointed. This really is for hard-core horror fans only. Overall, a strange idea that really will only work for hard-core horror fans. Since this isn't really a movie I won't give it a grade."
B00944CJRK &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; is a found-footage anthology that comprises six horror shorts: &#8220;Tape 56&#8221; &#8220;Amateur Night&#8221; &#8220;Second Honeymoon&#8221; &#8220;Tuesday the 17th&#8221; &#8220;The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger&#8221; and &#8220;10/31/98.&#8221; Actually, &#8220;Tape 56&#8221; is a &#8220;frame story&#8221; (directed by Adam Wingard, &#8220;You&#8217;re Next&#8221;) that links other five short movies &#8211; five short horrors that are mildly entertaining but not exactly scary.Let us forget the film&#8217;s contrived premise. A group of young men videotaping their criminal activities (who doesn&#8217;t?) breaks into an old man&#8217;s house looking for a certain video tape. What they found is a dead body and a stack of old VHS tapes.That&#8217;s silly, but still OK. Sadly, what follows is not really impressive, either. I hate to reveal much about the stories of each segment, so let me just say that though some of the shorts have nice ideas &#8211; and gory deaths and some naked women &#8211; none of them has managed to fully develop them into a compelling narrative.In short, the 116 minute film feels long with largely boring shaky cam footage."
B0095DFUF8 The newest episode aired over a week ago, but its still not on Amazon! I paid for the whole season & even sent them a complaint but nothing has happened...guess amazon just dropped the ball on this one...why am I paying for this again? I can just go watch it on some other site for free without the waiting around!"
B0095DFUF8 I was disappointed to find that this show was a complete set up.  I guess I should have known, but the characters are obnoxious and out of control."
B0095DFUF8 I would have loved to keep watching the series, however it's not part of the prime package and therefore I can't afford to see it.  Maybe in the future it will be put onto prime."
B0095DFUF8 GREAT SHOW! Love it!!! Gets better with time. For the person that said it`s not your typical Amish, we already know that. They even admit it!"
B0095DFUF8 I really enjoyed the show for the tongue & cheek it was --- seen so many people trying to determine if it was real or not :LOL: -- who cares it is TV and even reality TV is all real -- it is about ratings and dollars and entertainment folks ---"
B0095DFUF8 This is another fake reality show. The cast is made up of human train wrecks who long ago left the Amish community pretending to be innocents encountering the outside world. We have the typical collection of drunks, wifebeaters, petty criminals and losers that can be found anywhere.Putting the fake elements and the fraud of the show aside, the only thing of value here is that it seems a certain percentage of humans, no matter where they come from or how they are raised, are trash. Even though its a fake show, the really awful nature of each of their personalities comes out. The show might have been better called \"becoming trailer trash\"."
B0095DFUF8 I work with several Amish communities and not sure how legite this is.  I hope that those who don't know the Amish don't get crazy ideas about their culture."
B0095IDWG2 Amazing knowledge and would recommend this series to all my friends!!!  It keeps me chomping at the bit for more!!"
B0095IDWG2 If you have ever wanted to know more about the night sky, other planets in our solar syatem, or what makes it all work this is a perfect series to watch. They are great at explaining concepts so anyone can understand them."
B0095IDWG2 The Universe is a very good series with a lot of true science. And it is very well explained. Surprised the Creationists diden't picket this one, too!!"
B0095IDWG2 I love this series so much I have seen the entire 64 episodes twice already and am seeing it again for the third time.It is easy to watch and to understand."
B0095IDWG2 I love it. The visual presentations are spectacular and the explanations are down to earth enough for anyone to understand. I've always loved Astronomy, but most of the books I've tried to read are so technical that I gave up after a while. This series brings it close in an understandable and entertaining format."
B0095IDWG2 I like to explore the knowledge that is available from many sources. This series brings most of that knowledge to the forefront. All the theories and combines them to make a picture of what we suspect to be real. You will see as you progress through the episodes how much our science has changed in just the seasons this series has been on. They have a way of presenting the information to where it is interesting and engulfing. This series will keep you interested if you are into the science."
B0095IDWG2 I like all of the documentaries carrying The Universe logo. They are educational, informative and entertaining. The programs are always a first for me when I choose a scientific show."
B0095IDWG2 Great show. A lot of fun facts about astronomy. Fine for children. Illustrated with animation to keep their attention."
B0095IDWG2 Wanted something interesting enough for an old adult like me to watch and also basic enough to hold the attention of a younger kid (9).  This was both.  I'd prefer it were free though since its a PBS/Discovery Channel-type program originally.  I wouldn't pay for the whole series personally."
B0095IDWG2 Shows that are well produced like this one make learning about our neighborhood fun. Enough topics were covered  to bring the system we live in to focus."
B0095IDWG2 There's nothing that I can say to detract from this series, any season.  Oh, sure, some of it gets &#34;tedious&#34; in places...astrophysicists will talk about it's &#34;dumbing down&#34; while others will call it &#34;too cerebral&#34;.It's better than bad, it's good."
B0095IDWG2 Season 1 is only (ironically) the first in what is a long, diverse and wonderfully put together series on our physical planet and it's place in the grand scheme of things, and it's only &#34;short-coming&#34; is that they leave you wanting more and more...thankfully, each successive season tries to do just that!  Can't get enough!"
B0095IDWG2 if you are interested in the subject,you will like the series. Covers a lot of ground,much that was new to me."
B0095IDWG2 Simply amazing ! The information is very educational and make think and believe that life in the planet earth is fragil and beautiful, so I don't understand why the human specie is so selfish and destructive."
B0095IDWG2 I love this show! It brings the most learned people in their respective fields to discuss the wonders of the universe. They also use great computer graphics, and easy to understand analogies to explain just how and why our universe functions. 5 stars for this show. Thanks!"
B0095IDWG2 Interesting, informative and sometimes fun. I know sarah palin thinks that science is the devils' diaper, but it is still interesting to see whats going on outside of our own dirt ball of a planet. Why things are  the way they are, and what might be out there. Its worth an afternoon to see what other people are doing with there time."
B0095IDWG2 It's sometimes a little cheesy, but it's still a very good educational series. Lots of facts and some conjecture about the universe, which is, of course, a very large topic."
B0095IDWG2 If you love to learn about astronomy, this is the show for you, because it dives into different topics about the universe, the first episode being about the fun."
B0095IDWG2 I love this entire series and was seriously dejected when it left Netflix. Overjoyed to rediscover it. Weird habit -- I watch this before bed, and turn the sound completely off. Like closed captions for my bedtime videos, and it doesn't have them. Hence it loses one star for  Amazon's oversight."
B0095IDWG2 I have always been interested in Astronomy and Astrophysics. This is one of my favorite series on the topic. They explore theories about our universe, it's formation and it's demise. Excellent animations and scientists make these topics come alive."
B0095IDWG2 I haven't been disappointed yet with this series. Wonderful scientists with a great ability to bring the information into our reality."
B0095R3ES4 Great show but it needs Micheal Scott to be the center of the cast. Wish Steve Carrell could have made a few guest appearances."
B0095R3ES4 First, let me mention that, Michael Scott aside, I was a fan of this show just as much for Jim and Pam, and if they end their relationship on a \"divorce\" note I will NEVER invest in another show by these producers. Guess what? Breaking up a happy family to go out on a high-minded story arc is a betrayal to the fans, and here's one more fundamental truth: DIVORCE ISN'T FUNNY!!! These characters deserve to end the show as much in love and together as when they started.I am a STALWART fan of the series, and have been since it's American debut. I think the humor of the show was that most of the other people in the show were REAL people and Michael was the insane one. That is what the show was about, how a crazy manager interacts with real people. Michael was shocking, irrepressible, irredeemable, and loud, inappropriate at the worst and most inopportune moments, and almost entirely oblivious to it (which was also his saving grace). The moment a light of understanding hit his brain, he would suddenly become human, attempt to back pedal, and then begrudgingly apologize.It was this that made the show. When Michael left the office, the curtain should have closed, the lights turned up, and we should have been made to leave our seats. Instead, seasons 8 and 9 continued to turn the carcass over and make a mockery of the quirks of each character, way, way over emphasizing the suddenly, equally quirky traits of the staff. If it's one person being a fool and all around staring in awe and disbelief, that's an out of the ordinary moment. If everyone is cavorting around foolishly, there's no awe or disbelief.Here's the primary example: Michael tells the new temp Ryan to play along with a prank he intends to play on the receptionist Pam. Ryan, not yet aware of Michael's insanity, nods, and Michael calls for Pam.Pam walks into the manager's office, and Michael informs her that his choice in which employee to fire in their ongoing campaign of downsizing has been made simpler. Because she has been identified as an office supply thief of potentially thousands of dollars over 3 years of employment, she will not only be terminated, but will not even qualify for severance because of the punitive nature of her dismissal.Ryan shakes his head, non-verbally disavowing any participation in the \"prank\" as Michael stifles a gleeful chortle. Pam, however, begins to frown and denies the accusation, claiming that she has not even stolen so much as a paper clip, but Michael casts her plea aside and tells her to clean out her workspace.Pam begins to cry profusely, a reaction Michael at ONLY THAT MOMENT realizes is a bad turn. He promptly cries, \"You've been 'punked'\" and laughs, sticking to his joke even as it careens into a deadly plummet. Pam calls him a jerk and runs off.In another episode, Michael makes small talk with Pam and mentions the common phrase, Thank God it's Friday, and that it's another day overworked and underpaid. Pam's only reaction is to say, \"I know what you mean,\" and Michael suddenly becomes stern. He says, \"if you are unhappy with your compensation, bring it up with HR.\"Michael is clearly a character with huge flaws that all the other cast members have to tip toe around in order to get a solid day's work accomplished. None of the other characters exhibited signs of silliness, but as the seasons went on, the characters evolved their own various issues that, while making them unique, also made them all seem like cartoons. They stop tip-toeing and begin bumbling around Michael Scott style.Jim and Pam's relationship was the other huge staple of the show. Just because they're married doesn't mean their \"adventure\" is over. I married my wife and it felt like life had only just BEGUN at that moment. Pam should have been able to make something of her art. When she failed, it felt like the show was saying, \"Just give it up, kids. You're going to stay mediocre regardless.\" Jim's ambition to become a sports agent should have been much smaller, and he a lot more understanding of what he's putting his wife through. It's like nice, sweet, cool Jim has been replaced by Jack@ss Jim. If that's what we're left with, then none of his good moments, kind deeds, and hard choices have EVER mattered. He's just going to end up a douche eventually. NICE!"
B0095R3ES4 the office is a hilarious show that will forever be part of tv history all the characters are great and im sad to see it go but it had a good run i definitely reccomend"
B0095R3ES4 If you like the Office and have watched all the seasons leading up to this--go for it.If you hate James Spader's act, you might wince a few times. Now we all winced at Ricky and Steve, but this is a different wince with James. So, all the other cast are good and you gotta see these to make the rest of the series make sense, right?"
B0095R3ES4 The Office (as a whole) was an amazing show. It lagged near the end (as most shows do) but Season 9 came back solid and delivered the goods!"
B0095R3ES4 Every episode not only manages to disgrace this brand name but actually make seasons 1 through 5 worse, somehow. After seeing this season, I want to forget about the entire series and that's a shame, I recall truly enjoying the awkward Michael seasons. As for the actor who plays Andy, his absence at least made the show tolerable. Upon his return in this episode thoughts of blinding myself and bursting my eardrums became preferable to finishing the episode with his talentless non-portrayal of a character that has no aspirations beyond being overlooked, unfortunately thanks to the horrific brand of \"look-at-me-I-didn't-get-enough-love-from-mommy-as-a-child\" acting, we can not simply ignore Andy. Never underestimate the ambitions of individuals for attention and money to ruin art. Please cancel it now, we don't need an ending or series finale to this any more than we need a resolution to any rotting roadkill corpse in the middle of the interstate."
B0095R3ES4 Season Nine wrapped up one of my favorite shows of all time in a fashion that I can only describe as &#34;perfect&#34;. It retained the &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments that I've grown so used to over the past nine years (Dwight as &#34;Belschneckel for Christmas was one favorite, as well as Andy's sea voyage), as well as wrapping up all the plot lines that had been dangling out there. Last but not least, a few classic characters return briefly to help send the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin off with a bang. Long time fans will not be disappointed!"
B0095R3ES4 I'll never forget the first time I watched The Office.  I had always been very reluctant, because I had seen the previews, and I even watched the pilot (which I didn't like), so I never gave it a chance.  Then, my best friend and I were on a flight from California to Key West (6 hours), and at some point he passed his laptop over to me and told me to watch an episode or two.  I figured I had nothing to lose, and just picked a random episode from season 3 (the newest season at the time).  I remember laughing so stupidly hard that other passengers on the plane probably thought that I was insane.Throughout that trip, I watched both season 2 and season 3, and never missed another episode.Fast forward a few years now, and I met my future wife.  When we were hanging out at her family's house, I'd be channel surfing, and I'd come to the Office, a show that she said \"looked boring\".  I guess this was time for me to pay it forward.  She said she'd seen a few scenes when her brother had put it on, but that was it.  Well, she watched some of that season (season 6, I want to say), and was hooked, so we started watching from the very beginning, and I was able to relive the Office memories all over again.We really feel like we had a personal connection with the characters, specifically Jim & Pam.  The way their relationship started was very similar to ours...work place crushes while we both had significant others...the eventual relationship...the 'office' wedding, even their attitude and interests kind of mirrored ours.  It was even more freakishly similar when I was offered a job near Philadelphia, and we trekked across the country to try something new - even though the situations were pretty different, the feelings that both Jim & Pam had may have been a bit similar.This past season wasn't it's strongest...it wasn't the weakest, season 8 takes that cake, but it definitely wasn't up to par with the earlier seasons.  Many of the main cast members had left, the most devastating departure being Steve Carrell as Michael Scott, the original bone headed but ultimately pretty sweet manager of the paper branch.  Many of the writers had moved on as well, and it was evident.  There were story lines and characters here that just didn't feel interesting (Erin & Plop), funny (Andy), or needed (Nelly).  There were entire episodes where I didn't laugh once.  However, the end of the season is strong, particularly the last few episodes, and the finale is a fantastic send off that honestly had my wife and I crying like babies.In short, this was not the best season of this show, but it's still required viewing if you're a long time fan.  If you've been with the characters like I have for 8 years, you owe it to yourself to watch this all wrap up.  Even with the weak installments, I'd still put it in with the elite TV comedies (Arrested Development, Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm), and when this show really hit it's stride (season 3, 4) it was some of the best comedy on TV of all time.Goodbye, Dunder Mifflin.  We'll miss you."
B0095R3ES4 Really sad to see The Office close up shop.  This has been such a funny series.  I am glad, however, that Season 9 is seeing the series out the right way.  Some loose ends are getting tied up, and the characters are free to act a little crazier than in the past.  Andy's appearances have been few and far between as the season goes on.  Episode 11 &#34;Suit Warehouse&#34; is probably the funniest episode of the series."
B0095R3ES4 After nine years, viewers finally learn more about the mysterious documentary crew that has trailed our beloved characters through every aspect of their lives, on the job and off.We also tie up many loose ends, as Angela's marriage (questionable since day one) finally begins to unravel and she revisits her initial long-time love for Dwight; Jim, who always swore his job at DM was &#34;temporary,&#34; receives the opportunity of a lifetime to help run a sports marketing firm, but as it's in Philadelphia, must decide between a dream career and his marriage to his dream woman.Throughout the 25-episode season, many departed characters from earlier seasons make an appearance, including Steve Carell as Michael Scott, as well as more minor characters including David Wallace, Mose, Todd Packer and Jan Levenson.One episode, &#34;The Farm,&#34; centers upon a death in Dwight's family, and introduces viewers to his sister Fannie and brother Jeb. Although clearly meant as a spin-off episode, the potential series was not picked up.It's hard to end any TV series, let alone one as long-running and beloved as The Office. There's just no ideal way to say goodbye and send the characters off to the rest of their lives. But, given the odds, the gang at Dunder Mifflin was given a great sendoff."
B0095R3ES4 i still love the office. i was afraid that things would go down hill after michael left but it is still just as entertaining as ever even though i still don't like spaders character."
B0095R3ES4 What a great ending to one of my favorite comedies. I enjoyed the way everything was wrapped up. I also enjoyed seeing Steve Carrell back at the end. Left me laughing and feeling very warm & cuddly."
B0095R3ES4 The final season of The Office was very good, in my opinion.Gone was Robert California. Also, the absence of Ed Helms due to other projects (I guess) was ver well handled.There were some very good ideas, like the documentary crew appearing in some scenes (one of them protecting Pam from being attacked).The extras are very good, showing some audition, blooper reel, etc.All in all, one of the best shows I've ever watched."
B0095R3ES4 What was up with this season? They totally changed the hard work put into season 8 and changed everything! The whole Andy as the manager got threw out the window for some reason and he was gone for half the season. Then, his relationship with Erin got messed up in the process. Their characters were made for each other for like 3 seasons. They liked each other at different times secretly, and when they finally got together in Season 8, that was amazing! Now, in Season 9, they just threw away 3 seasons of hard work into the trash. WTF?Pam and Jim was pretty much a boring topic/storyline in season 8, so there wasn't that much to talk about, but in season 9 they were constantly being shown. I didn't really care for their story as Jim and Pam had problems with their relationship and work. In this season, I would say 75% of it was about these two characters, trying to figuring about themselves so this is your A story right here.Now, your B story would be about everything else. Dwright is always in every show and I think it is because Andy was missing for half the season. Dwright is looking to become a family man and I thought this was the most interesting story that I liked this season. He wants to be with Angela, but she is in the pretend marriage with the senator. This goes on for a long time, until Dwright gets a new girlfriend and possible wife material. Then, at the end, he finally has to choose between his girlfriend or Angela. I would had chosen the new girl, because Angela is such a Bitch. But, okay, I could see why Dwright chose Angela.I didn't like Erin as much as I did in other seasons. Manly because her character got changed so much and Andy wasn't there and some other younger guy liked her. Those two as a couple just doesn't make any sense to me. Erin is a somewhat older than this young guy and she is at that stage were she going to get married soon. (I thought Andy was going to marry her.) The young guy is at that stage were she having fun and meeting a lot of girls still. Well, anyways, everything fall apart after one episode were Andy figures out a plan and to try to break make them feel bad about them being together, and after that they weren't really ever mention as a couple ever again. So, that story arc just closed off.I didn't really like the last episode. It wasn't as good because they needed to make Michael Scott do more than have him there and not say or do anything. All he did was smile like a crazy person and didn't say anything and it looked really weird. They should of had him do something funny, while he was there.I wouldn't recommend this season to anyone that actually liked season 8. If you are interested, you pretty much need to watch the last few shows and that's it. The whole season isn't worth it until then."
B0095R3ES4 As always, this show is great!  I really enjoy the show and encourage anyone to give it a shot.  Try it, you might like it!"
B0095R3ES4 Despite being a loyal fan of \"The Office\" for many years, the show hit such a rock bottom after the horrific eighth season that I actually considered dropping out entirely.  Luckily, the show producers (and NBC) must have realized the same thing, as the decision to label this the \"Final Season\" did wonders in terms of all-around quality.There are three main reasons why this final season made \"The Office\" watchable again (minor spoilers)...1. The departure of Andy Bernard for the first portion of the season.  The show had pretty much completely wrecked that character during that eighth season, so (despite all that the \"Nard Dog\" had brought to the show in previous seasons) his absence was needed just to get away from his terrible character for awhile.2. With Andy out of the picture, the focus shifted again to where it should have been all along...the incredible ensemble cast.  Whereas the eighth season focused WAAAAYYY too much on guest stars and gimmicks, this season gets back to the tried-and-true formula of just letting the characters play out and watching the hijinx ensue.3. In the past, as evidenced by the Wedding & Baby episodes for instance, whenever the writers of this show have desperately needed a really good string of episodes, they have always come through.  This was again true down the \"stretch run\" of this season, as the final slew of episodes are truly magical once again with the writers being able to \"pull out all the stops\".  The finale could easily be considered one of the best episodes of the entire show for its equal parts drama & comedy (what the show always needed to succeed in the first place).Now, don't get me wrong...this is not the best season of \"The Office\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Without Michael Scott, this show was just never going to be the same again.  However, it was nice that the finale season was able to pull itself up just enough to make me look forward to watching it each week instead of dreading it.Thus, the Ninth (and final) Season of \"The Office\" was able to do just enough to justify the \"goes out on a good note\" tag.  Seeing as how this was on the heels of bottoming out the previous year, it is a testament to all the show creators/writers/actors who truly cared enough to make the ending of this great show special."
B0095R3J8O My favorite TV show to date. :) Can't wait to see many more seasons of this show.  Good for the whole family"
B0095R3J8O This show is so inspiring! I just can't get enough. My husband loves it too! Characters deal with real life situations and I makes it rewarding to watch."
B0095R3J8O Streaming it.  I like the interplay among the four adult siblings raising their own kids and still dealing with their parents.  Lots of laughs and love of children, but not syrupy.  All actors do a good job.  Interesting that one of the children has Asperger's syndrome and good to see this recognition for children with special challenges."
B0095R3J8O I love the stories so far this season... and it just seems they play their characters true to the story that I just began to watch this season and have cried thru each episode..."
B0095R3J8O &#34;Parenthood&#34; is a good show.  I watched four seasons on Amazon quickly and I enjoyed it.  The characters are genuine and believable.  The stories are true to life.  I just got a little tired of how the lame characters kept being lame and there was NO presence of a higher power or God in the show - even when a mommy had cancer.  Just void of anything spiritual with scenarios that seriously needed some faith.  But, I sure did watch each episode and was sad more were not yet available yet.  The characters that bugged me were obviously great actors because I got emotional about them.  Worth the time to enjoy."
B0095R3J8O I see so much of myself in this season.They've introduced a new character, and though they had not (yet) identified him as such, I realized that the new photographer also has Asperger's Syndrome. It's nice to see a semi-regular character who shows that it is possible for an adult with Asperger's to survive in society, even if people think he's weird.Just like Max, I did run for something when I was in Jr. High School. As I recall, I ran for 7th grade treasurer, and won. Later in college, I ran for treasurer of the dorm building I lived in, and won that election. (I did not realize I had Asperger's, high functioning autism) until I was 42.)But there is so much more to recommend this series, and this season. Things that affect many parents in real life are affecting these characters, and yes, some of the characters make mistakes, just like we make  many mistakes in life.I love this series, and highly recommend it. I anxiously await season 5, so I can watch the season again, but without commercials.John"
B0095R3J8O This show is awesome gives you a real life look into life with a child that has autism and how an extended family copes 5 star rating"
B0095R3J8O The Braverman family is a hoot and oh so predictable (most of the time). Each character's nuances are better known and their behavior has become expected; however, they never cease to be entertaining. Reaching the end of the 4th season left a hole in our entertainment choices."
B0095R3J8O I watch many series and feel Parenthood to be the only one that shows a real multi generational family in the truest sense."
B0095R3J8O This season is one chock full of changes for the Bravermans, as Adam and Kristina adjust to having eldest daughter Haddie go off to college across the country, Julia and Joel try to create a new family unit with adopted son Victor, Zeek attempts to befriend and help a newly returned young veteran (Matt Lauria).Amidst it all, Kristina (Monica Potter) learns she has breast cancer...and everything changes.As always, the Bravermans may argue and clash, become blinded by their own lives, but when one of their own is faced with trouble of any kind, they are always there, physically and emotionally, in support of that individual. Season 4 is no exception. Viewers who have become attached to the Braverman clan will enjoy watching them navigate this latest installment of their life's twists and turns, hoping for the best, although of course like real life, there are no guarantees."
B0095R3J8O I have loved the entire series.  I love the dynamics of the family and trials and triumphs.  They are what most families are..a little bit of everything and lots of love to hold it all together. Even though it's a script, it's so downright believable."
B0095R3J8O So sorry can't view season 5.  Am hanging out ona limb until it is available guessing what happens from the one sentencewritten about each epsode.  Wonderful family program.Always interesting.  Great script anf exelent acting feel like they are my family."
B0095R3J8O Well balanced vignettes between the various ensemble casts.  This episode takes on tough issues with reality and grace.  My heart hurt for Crosby and Jasmine, the vet who could not find his way, the parent trying to connect with his adopted son, the photographer easing into a more open relationship world.  Beautiful, tight writing (not an extra word anywhere) and beautifully acted.  An excellent example of television at its best."
B0095R3J8O This show is one of my favorite shows ever. I am so happy 4 seasons were available with my prime membership. I will gladly pay for the 5th season, at $1.99 an episode it is so worth it."
B0095R3J8O This show could go on forever and I would continue watching. Great cast and story line all around great show."
B0095R3J8O Love/hate the cast. It does do a really good job of making you care for the characters. Alot of sad moments but ALOT of really happy ones as well."
B0095R3J8O This is a wonderful show. So much reality and insight into family and the struggles and love theyhave for each other. All families should watch this together."
B0095R3J8O This episode will make you cry.  I loved it.  I love the Bravermans.  I feel like they are a part of my family!!!"
B0095R3J8O Best season yet. The series hit it's stride in Season 4. Love how this show addresses real life issues like work-life balance, religion, and teen angst."
B0095R3J8O Fun, charming, sad, tragic, uplifting, bold.  There are many more adjectives that I can use, but why bore you. Watch for your self and come to the same conclusion that I have reached."
B0095R3J8O I heard last season that Parenthood wasn't going to be renewed.  I was so upset.  Finally a good show that I could look forward to watching each week and talking about with my friends.  I love it so much that since there are too many conflicts on my DVR--someone in my house records every reality show known to man--I purchased a season pass through Amazon and as each new episode comes it, it is added to my library.  No remembering to try to get it taped on the DVR, it's just there for my viewing pleasure whenever I want it.  I think this is the way TV should be.Thanks, Amazon!Robyn T"
B0095R3J8O Season 4 picks up several months past where the last season left off. Issues include the assimilation of Julia's adopted son, Victor; Sarah's progression into life with her younger boyfriend and with a new character, Sarah's boss, played by Ray Romano; Kristina, now the mom of three, is faced with a health crisis, which of course affects the entire family, including Haddie, who is off at Cornell; and Amber begins a romance with someone who is atypical of the men she tends to date. These are the main issues that start what looks to be another enthralling season of what arguably is the best comedy-drama on TV."
B0095R3J8O I had to review all four seasons because I can't remember what happened yesterday. I remembered a lot about Seasons 1-3 and by the time I got to Season 4 I think I'd used up five boxes of Kleenex. This is a story about the kind of family we all wish we had. A family that gets together, celebrates together, mourns together and enjoys all aspects of life with the grandparents, the children and the children's children.  It was especially important/interesting/heart rendering to me because I have a grandson who is severely autistic and since one of the grandchildren has 'asbergers' - a form of autism - and the behavior of Max is so similar to my grandson though my grandson doesn't speak or eat but they share the same type of traits (my grandson is 12--oh lord-puberty). This is covered in every show so it behooves anyone who has a  child with autism in any form can benefit from some of the things they do and show which can be valuable information. Basically it's a beautiful drama/comedy and I am so happy I ordered the tapes; now I can't wait for the fifth season. I truly am in love with this show and all the cast - they are 'perfection.'"
B0095R3J8O Enjoyable show. Took me a while to begin to get all the characters' relatioships straight as the plot moves quickly, and it was the first time I had ever watched this show. Got a kick out of daughter trying to get a job with the gruff photographer. Thought the inclusion of the young son with mental challenges would  involve many people who have friends and relatives with similar issues. I will need to watch some more shows to see if I can get more involved with alll of the other characters.."
B0095R3J8O Well ya just had to go down the breast cancer route. The writer's who thought this story line would be compelling, for lack of any original ideas, should be replaced. Not only has this been done dozens of times, but it has been done better. I smell and see a dearth of story lines here and probably the end of a pretty good show - for NBC.Definitely worth watching the first three seasons but then if you are smart, you will let it go and move on to another show. Season four blows. Unbelievably melodramatic and preachy."
B0095R3J8O Worryingly misleading about cancer treatment realities.  Three observations:First: no doc would allow someone who needed surgery as urgently as the Parenthood character is alleged to have needed it to wait for weeks to have the surgery.  It's called 'malpractice,' and for good reason: if a cancer is thought to be so urgent as to require surgery, it's medically ill-advised to wait.Second:  no one who has been through chemo is doing splits at a bar a few weeks later.  Or only BEGINNING to lose a little hair.  Someone who has been through chemo is obviously and visibly pale, weak, and bruised, and looses hair (if she is going to) much more dramatically.Third: going through surgery, chemo, and radiation--which the Parenthood character is alleged to have to go through--takes an enormous toll.  Most people--even young, otherwise healthy, and clearly very affluent--people who have been down that path LOOK it, for months, and possibly forever, moreover, since you are leaving with a weakened immune system after cancer treatment, you are much more vulnerable.It's a huge disservice to the many women (and some men!) who have gone through breast cancer treatment to make it look as manageable as the show does. Even when there are not emergencies--as often there are not--cancer treatment is a slog, a struggle, and it marks you for life.I understand that television glamorizes/misrepresents most of the difficult things in life. Pretend that the characters could afford to live as lavishly as they do in Berkeley  (if the parents' house/compound were in Berkeley--which is it not--it would be worth many millions of dollars).  Pretend that normal working people and parents have the sort of time and money to do overnights in expensive hotels, wear fabulous clothes, constantly have parties with snazzy gifts, etc.  That's just standard Hollywood fare; no one is really fooled.But DO NOT MISREPRESENT WHAT CANCER TREATMENT REQUIRES, or WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO THROUGH/HAVE GONE THROUGH IT.  That's just irresponsible."
B0095R3J8O I love this TV show, because it has come together, acting and writing. I came across this show during the third season when it was well coordinated. I am a fan of Gilmore Girls and was the reason for how I was interested in Parenthood. The story lines are well crafted capturing human emotion. This is a lovable story line with three generations of the same family, and all the trials and tribulations family goes through. Some characters have developed roles like Adam Braverman as the protecting father and husband. Crosby as the adventurous yet good guy underneath the thick shell. Sarah who goes from relationship to relationship, and as such is defined by them. Julia the stereotypical successful lawyer balancing family life, Joel her stereotypical supportive husband and father. There are few stereotypical characters, however most of the characters move back and forth between their portrayed characteristics and good ones. Season four and three are by my opinion the best so far all because of writing and acting. Season five is coming back on NBC September 26th, until then I will watch marathons of these seasons. If you enjoy sitcoms based around families than other TV shows, this is a great show for you. Each show has a cliffhanger for each story arc, which keeps you hooked. This is one of the best sitcoms on TV, though there is a lack of minority representation. When season five comes out I will be ordering it from Amazon too. Until than Parenthood returns to NBC September 26th moving from Tuesdays to Thursdays."
B0095R53M4 My wife and I love this show. All the characters carry their own weight and its hard to pick a favorite."
B0095R53M4 Pohlers character is a short stature over achiever sugar driven go to college come back to hometown to make it a better place.The superiviosr, her boss, is this old timer burn out whose grown tired of meeting with town people over the lengthy time in office and just has his carefree19 year assistant cancel his appointments.The disdainful 19 year old carefree assistant is a character herself.Another character is these dreamer of a man whose sees his job as just interim waiting for his big break as a rich entrepreneur or political campaign manager.  He goes on businees ventures and fails miserably eventhough his ideas are not to shaby and presents them with great marketing techniques.Another is this 29 year old meat head of a man who plays guitar and hasn't anknowledge his isn't going to have a career as rock star.  he dates the 19 year old assistant which is perfect since the 19 year old and him share the same level of maturity.All the characters make the show funny."
B0095R53M4 This was hilarious! Love the Jerry moments.. They always make me laugh! Hope they do another one of these because there's already been some more great moments in the new season"
B0095R53M4 Perfect cast and great writing. A mix of sitcom and SNL skits. I love this show! Every season so far."
B0095R53M4 This is such a great ensemble cast, but this year, in particular, NBC seem to be going out of its way to hide the series and destroy its continuity.  I had to purchase the season just to be able to see all the episodes, even though it will be free next year.  Bad network! Shame!!4-15-13  I have to say that although Animal Control, the most recent episode is really funny, it features yet another segment showing characters using cigars for some warped \"pleasure.\"  I find all references to tobacco in 2013 unnecessary and offensive.  It is an addictive, deadly drug that should be as far from the eyes of children as possible.  Personally, I am deathly allergic to the smell of cigars, get an instant thundering headache and have been known to involuntarily vomit after being forced to be anywhere near one...and I am a photographer who has worked as a war correspondent and been around rotting dead bodies...nowhere near the reaction.One of their first season episodes featured \"mouth tobacco\" which was the topic of a 90s movie called The Good Fight, about lawyers challenging Big Tobacco after a teenager contracted and ultimately died of mouth cancer from the use of chewing tobacco.  He was addicted by free samples given out at a state fair...a few chews, or as few as fifty cigarettes can produce a lifetime addiction...painfully shortened.Product placement is still a great media issue and Big Tobacco is still there, trying to induce children to fill their ever-emptying ranks of dying addicts...it's how they work.Tobacco has appeared twice as much in media available to children over the past two years than it had for several years in the past.  This is not a minor issue.  It affects us all."
B0095R53M4 A great series just gets better. There's more character development. Anne and Chris take it to the next level. Funny episodes all around."
B0095R53M4 A solid show, with a top rate cast and excellent writing from Season 1, how much farther could P&R go? At Season 5, they've fleshed out each character and kept them all moving on and up. Changing a little but remaining the same. It's a perfect formula for a long run. Wittier and smarter than 30 Rock, it's geared more to the average viewer. There are no weak parts, characters who don't move the plots along. Ron Swanson is my idol and Ann Perkins is my dream girl. Bring on Season 6!"
B0095R53M4 All these characters are well scripted and unforgettable...we watch it again and again ...we are huge fans and want more"
B0095R53M4 Unless they ramp things up quickly, this is just about dead. Nothing new, interesting or clever here.  Seems Poehler is just dropping into the old corporate mold as fast as she can.  You've come a long way, baby.  Yeah-right."
B0095R53M4 Hard to believe it has been 5 years or seasons!! The show gets better and better. It is never stale. It continues to have little twists and turns and then something new and keeps you on your toes.New characters fit right in. Subplots continue and gains your interest then stop and the main plot continues.Like the hole behind  a certain someone's house."
B0095R53M4 Clever writing. Exellent cast. The only sitcom currently on air in which every cast member is outstanding. The casting director should win an Emmy!"
B0095R53M4 This show continues to be the best, funniest, most outrageous thing on television, and it has only gotten stronger with age. Like the previous four seasons, number five is nothing short of delightful. I love the characters of this show, and they are all cast perfectly- Ron, Lesley, Tommy, Jerry, April, Andy, Ann, Chris, Donna, and Ben... they're all hilarious in their own separate ways, and anybody who has every worked in government office will recognize their personalities and quirks as being spot-on parodies. Even the heel of this show, councilman Jamm, is hilarious. It's too bad it's only available on DVD and not Blu-ray, but it can be streamed in HD, which is always a great thing. A show this good needs to be watched in High Definition!"
B0095R53M4 Many series rest on their laurels after brining the funny for a few years. Parks and Rec continues to amuse. We meet Tammy 1, Ron's first wife, the essence of evil this season. I vote Knope in 2012. Tom's Entertainment 720 is a merchandisers paradise and little else. Poor Jerry's well hung but doesn't have the measles, I think. Rob Lowe is literally the most obnoxious of the lot. No really, literally. Keep watching. It gets better."
B0095R53M4 By this time in a series many shows begin to lose steam, but not Parks and Rec. This is the funniest show ever and I hope it goes on for five more seasons. Leslie Knope makes me want to run for Congress. Seriously. As for the rest of the crew each of them (including Jerry) is as valuable to the show as the rest and the chemistry between all of them is incomparable. Ok, the same chemistry is also found in 30 Rock, especially between Lemmon and Jack, and in The Office, the American version. Still, P & R is my favorite."
B0095R53M4 Some shows are funny and no one knows about them this is funny and everybody already knows about it,  good for multiple viewings and laughing over with friends."
B0095R53M4 Finally bought the 5th Season, thinking it was the final season.  Which was a good thing.  Seems like they gave some life and story in this season, cant wait to see season 6.  Like all Parks and Recreation series, you either like their humor/comedy or you don't.  I think this is one of their better season/series."
B0095R53M4 There are few television comedies I have seen where the cast and characters were in absolute perfect harmony with one another. Barney Miller, WKRP in Cincinnati,News Radio and Carpoolers were shows like that. The characters work perfectly together to make the show both funny and witty. In this show we have the perfect blend of nuts, straight men and dry wits."
B0095R53M4 Another great season. Loved the Biden cameo. The season seemed a little less focused than other seasons but still very enjoyable. Finished the whole season in a hurry!"
B0095R53M4 Just like previous seasons of Parks and Recreation you will find plenty of laughs, This season's highlights Ron meeting Diane Lewis (Played by Lucy Lawless) The two's chemistry on the screen is very well portrayed. Watch the whole season as it unfolds. Rest assured there are plenty of laughs. Amy Poehler keeps us all glued to the screen. \"Ron\" Swanson character played by Nick Offerman gets better each season.Good Acting by everyone in the cast. Enjoyed it - Fun to watch if you like light comedy."
B0095R53M4 Love this show! Every single person in the cast is hilarious and impeccably cast. The writing never gets old. Hope they keep going."
B0095R53M4 MARRY ME AMY I'M NOT GAY BUT I LOVE YOU!Ok. That's been said.MARRY ME ROB LOWE YOU'RE OLD BUT HOT!!!!!ALSO AZIZ ANSARI MARRRY ME BE MY TINY DANCER!I love this show way, way too much. I think I may actually BE that one bitter chick, um, dark hair. She rocks! She is funny on Portlandia too! I know her name I'm tired today. I LOVE YOU BITTER DARK HAIRED CHICK BUT WE CANT GET MARRIED WED KILL EACH OTHER!"
B0095R53M4 The first few episodes are a bit rocky, but then we're back to the full swing of this fantastic show!"
B0095R53M4 this show is phenomenal. It has everything: wit, humor, genuineness, relatability, Rashida Jones, Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza... I mean the cast is incredible, and so is the writing. You can't go wrong with this show."
B0095R53M4 I LOVE this show! The more I watch it the better I like it. This show is so laugh out loud funny!"
B0095R53M4 We have seen 4 seasons of Park and Recreation  and it is so addictive because you soon become a part of these peoples lives and you can't wait for the next episode."
B009651C9S My daughter LOVES Doc!  Cute stories that come with small peoples' life lessons and we enjoy watching it with her."
B009651C9S It's a very sweet show.  my 4.5 year old daughter loves it.  It's a great show that teaches about having empathy."
B009651C9S this is a cute cartoon where her stuffed animals become alive. Good stories and fun cartoon by Disney. Would recommend"
B009651C9S Doc McStuffins is a favorite of my 3 yo.  This is perfect, no complaints.  good graphics too........I recommend.  We watch this on the Kindles Fire HD"
B009651C9S Doc McStuffins is one of our favorite shows.  My preschooler loves it.  I was so sad to see that it's not available on amazon instant video anymore."
B009651C9S My children love this cartoon!  And I love how they take care of their toys and animals now with check-ups and good advice.  They have also decided that they don't want to eat foods with sugar because Doc said they need to eat more fruits and vegetables.  Just adorable!"
B00978LMCG never seen this before ordering it and it was very dumb,i wouldnt recommend it to anybody because its very stupid."
B00978LMCG This is one of those movies that had been done before. The acting in the movie is good, but the storyline won't be new to you, if you have seen other movies like this one such as: Wrong Turn. The saving grace about this movie that kept me watching it to the end, is the wanting to know if anyone makes it out to safety. With that said, give it a watch as it isn't that bad but it ain't nothing new."
B00978LMCG warning warning this VHS movie is a homemade vhs recorded, cheap cheap I don't know how they make it..5 retard white dudes get lost in the country side...well this is a bad really bad movie..this is the one of the worst movies I ever seen in my short life ))))))) stay away, don't rent don't buy don't see, do not try to see in Netflix stay away...."
B00978LMCG It's hard to think of anything innovative these days. Especially if you had to judge the horror media today through this film.5 friends on a road trip? Check.Come across creepy places? Check.Ignoring a grave warning? Check.Constantly swear like your whole vocabulary has no words beyond 2 syllables? Check.Oh, and one of THE most annoying cliches: overt predictability.The shortest amount of time I had to be able to predict anything was around ten seconds. Either I've watched too many horror movies of this sort or... wait. Maybe that's it.This is supposed to be IFC, yet it feels like Hollywood- meaning it feels cookie-cutter in its setup, premise, and execution (pun intended).There may have been one or two scenes that got me to jump, but The Grudge was better at getting me to really JUMP, not just have a small jumpstart. Not to mention the main character seemed to not know (at first) how to use his camera for anything more than to try to make a sex video with his girlfriend (believe it or not, filmmakers out there, not ALL men are sex animals, some actually respect women as women and not sex toys). He and the rest do seem to present the one thing that's almost convincing me to stop watching indie horror: no real aspect of hope of getting out alive, but pulling the same mistakes the kids in the previous horror film you watched make and getting offed in the process.The decisions these kids made made me think they were kindergarten dropouts rather than try to convince they had a brain at all. Not to mention the video itself, though described in the beginning to be top-of-the-line in all its features, kept having cliched glitches yet no explanation as to why they kept happening (I doubt cameras detect human tension and therefore constantly screw up their own quality in the process).I hope IFC doesn't keep letting people repeat this type of movie mistake."
B00978LMCG this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever.\"Dumb\" is too smart for this movie!This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie!I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that's how stupid this movie is!80% of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever! IT MADE NO SENSE!  nothing was even remotely realistic or logical!If this was a film about how to make the worst decisions ever while being hunted by a murderer- then it's the best movie ever! lolThis movie was so bad it's hard to give examples- I'm so sorry.I will never watch a movie by this director ever again.I'm sorry that I sound like a broken record... it's just I can't believe how gawd awful this film was!"
B00978LMCG Okay, many reviews are stating this was horrible.  I disagree.  If the movies &#34;Blair Witch Project,&#34; &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&#34; and &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; were combined, they would produce this movie.  You have the shaky filming, faux-documentary style filming, similar to &#34;Blair Witch.&#34;  You have weird, hermit/hillbilly/backwoods killers, torturing people for unknown reasons, comparable to &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; (although in fairness, the cannibals in the &#34;Hills&#34; movies ate their victims; no proof of cannibalism in this movie, just parts of bodies stripped of flesh, tossed into the woods.  I mean, if they were cannibals, would they toss away that much meat?)  Finally, you have some gore, complete with a fat man in an apron - and possibly a mask? Unsure of that due to the filming - similar to &#34;Texas Chainsaw.&#34;  Add to that, although I fully expected the type of ending this movie had, it still made me jump a tad bit in my seat, and that is a rare thing for a movie to do to me.  The acting was more than acceptable, storyline was loose - but there.  No questions were really answered, but it was still a satisfying flick."
B00978LMCG This movie was horrible. If you are a fan of horror films skip it brcause you are noy missing much."
B00978LMCG Justin (Victor Zinck Jr.) gets a camera for his birthday from his girlfriend Brook (Mittita Barber) and immediately goes into little boy mode. They go on a trip to \"the cabin\" with another couple Kirk (Aslam Husain) and Amanda (Chelsey Reist). Amanda's sister Danielle (Christie Burke) tags along as the moody \"whatever\" girl.The first half of the film takes place in the car. We are filled with the \"Turn the camera off!\" and \"Okay it's off\" stupidity. They detour to a place called the Crowsnest to get half priced beer only to be harassed by slashers in a travel trailer for the second half of the film during which we see film footage of trees and ferns.This is a lousy \"kids in the woods\" film made worse with terrible found footage and a bad script. If you are going to skip one found footage film this year, I think you found it.Parental Guide F-bomb. Brief Nudity (Mittita Barber). Near sex."
B00978M72U Cons 1stNot bad but not revolutionary either but a good character study. I thought that with her androgynous appearance she would have played on that more. With the look that they gave her and all the efforts put into it i felt it was pointless. Too me it seems like she was somewhat totally unaware of what was going on. Not sure what the director was trying to do with the film or the character. It was hard to really determine if she was a manipulator or just plain naive. Then the wife was supposedly attracted to her and everyone else in the house. But nothing really transpired which was a complete let down. I hate movies that suggest things but don't act upon them. If you want to see a film similar to this but a little more straight forward try 'Albatross\". Overall I think with OLivia Thirby's beauty I think they could have pushed things a little more. I think she was better in \"THE WACKNESS\" as far as her demeanor was concerned.Pros:Overall though the movie was somewhat interesting if you deal with these situations on a day to day basis. I can definitely understand how men and women or children could have a unexplained attraction to a individual. The film strongly suggest this in a very calm way. It also points out how someone can be judged just by appearance like myself for instance. Just because you may be artistic and you express your self in your appearance doesn't always suggest these things. Martine was clearly a very stylish and stunningly attractive androgynous character in the film. So the attraction that most had to her was quite understandable. The scene with the little boy and the swimming pool I thought was pretty accurate. I really appreciate the writer showing this and being bold enough to put that out there. There is one other film that suggest this called \"Hesher\" with Natalie Portman. I truly do believe that children have these emotions even though they are premature and innocent. Overall I thought this was a good movie very different but I just thought it could have been executed better. But the type of person Martine was is rarely talked about in films. They didn't go for the stereotypical blonde which I greatly appreciate. I can truly identify with this character completely because I am artsy and androgynous individual myself. And because of this I get misunderstood all the time and misjudged all the time. The scene where she was walking through the city was really a nice scene.Over all 4 stars because I think they had a lot of ideas and material to work with here. But they just didn't take it as far as it could have been taken. This could have been an amazing drama... one of a kind actually. It could have been better than Poison Ivy or any of those. Not so much  that they had to make her a bad person or a villain? I just think some of the things that transpired could have been shown in detail and had more of a edge too it. But over all for me it was a satisfying entry."
B00978M72U too many attractive people are living under one roof in an upper class section of LA. The movie drips with what can only be called a sunny narcissism. Yes, there's trouble in paradise, though for all their well-intentioned pretensions, none of the characters seem particularly bright enough to look past their narrow horizons, much less their own worst impulses. Perhaps this is why film makers shouldn't live in LA; they cut their cultural teeth on the town and wind up making films like this."
B00978M72U Given the screenplay was co-written by Lena Dunham, creator and breakout star of HBO'sGirls, I was hoping this 2012 indie relationship drama would resonate strongly like Lisa Cholodenko's acclaimed Los Angeles-set films (Laurel Canyon,The Kids Are All Right), especially with such a smart cast of actors. However, something feels amiss in director Ry Russo-Young's coolish approach to a familiar story of adulterous deception and family dysfunction. The pacing feels glacial, and the characters are just not that involving emotionally. Perhaps that was the intention in showing the shallow nature of the lifestyle being portrayed, but it rubs off on the film's inertia leaving it feeling quite flat. The setting is LA's funky-chic Silver Lake neighborhood where sound engineer Peter lives with his psychotherapist wife Julie along with their young son and her teenaged daughter from a previous marriage, Kolt. They epitomize the laid-back, everything's-cool attitudes one associates with affluent Southern Californians.Enter Martine, a New York acquaintance of Julie's college friend  who happens to be an attractive 23-year-old experimental filmmaker. She has agreed to work as Peter's assistant in exchange for him helping out on her latest project, an arty video installation revolving around close-ups of ants. How Martine emotionally invades the family is the crux of the story, and to the credit of Russo-Young and Dunham, she never comes across as an unrepentant interloper like more commercially driven exploitative films have done in the past. It's just that the plot pretty much goes the way you would expect it would go from the outset, although the characters carry decidedly ambiguous natures that make some of the story turns feel more complex than they really need to be. For instance, the inevitable tryst between Martine and Peter lacks believable passion because it feels almost matter-of-fact. In hindsight, I feel like it should have been the driving force in pushing each character toward self-examination.The cast is not really at fault here as the acting, for the most part, is sensitive and assured. Olivia Thirlby (the best friend inJuno) provides the requisite gamine quality needed to make Martine credible as an object of obsession even if her character remains a cipher throughout. The always becalming Rosemarie DeWitt (Rachel Getting Married) delivers a thoughtful balancing act between earth mother and jealous wife as Julie. John Krasinski has a bit harder time escaping his amiable good-guy image fromThe OfficeandAway We Go, but he does provide some surprisingly heated moments as Peter that make you wonder if he could do a greater variety of roles onscreen. As the constantly yearning Kolt, India Ennenga appears to be channeling early Claire Danes, but she makes the character's unrequited love palpable. In smaller parts, Justin Kirk as a horned-up Hollywood screenwriter and Julie's attentive patient and Dylan McDermott as her self-possessed ex-husband bring much needed alpha energy to the proceedings. A late meltdown scene with Kolt's smarmy Italian tutor (Emanuele Secci) feels very out of place. Lethargic viewing."
B00978M72U Who says an indi-film can't be a run of the mill soap opera?  That's pretty much what we get here in this brief (85 minutes) look at sexual desires, infidelity and questionable morality.  The best thing director/writer Ry Russo-Young (\"You Won't Miss Me\") has going for her is the cast.John Krasinski stars as Peter, a Hollywood sound technician who is married to Julie (Rosemarie DeWitt), a therapist.  Julie has a teenage daughter (India Ennenga) who has a crush on her step-dad's assistant (Justin Kirk).  A twenty- something documentarian named Martine (Olivia Thirlby) shows up to get some help with special effects and sound for her film about bugs.Martine is a friend of a friend and once Peter first meets Martine, everybody's hormones kick into high gear.  Like all good soaps we've got the hunky ex-hubby (Dylan McDermott) coming around for dinner.  We've got Julie accepting flirtatious advances from a patient.  The daughter has her eyes on the assistant and the assistant is goo-goo for Martine and Martine for Peter.  Whew!While there is at least one scene of a sexual nature, nothing is overly graphic and little skin is ever shown.  The script is OK and while I was buying all the coy looks for a while it just started to get a bit silly.  While the film has its moments, it will likely be forgotten pretty quickly."
B00978M72U I abandoned watching this. I tried. As soon as the young girl cozied up to the John Krasinski character, I gave it up. It wasn't  going anywhere to begin with and now it was just trash."
B00978SIJ6 Butter starring Jennifer Garner, Ty Burrell, and Olivia Wilde is a fun and quirky comedy. Usually I don't care for satire kind of films because they are too \"smart\" for their own good, but this one is surprisely entertaining. Garner gives a stellar performance (her best role yet), her character if ruthless, selfish, arrogant, and tends to play the victim from time to time. Her husband played by Burrell is retiring from the world of butter carving and is having an affair with a stripper played by Wilde. So Garner takes over for him and enters into the next butter carving competiton, she will do anything to win especially since her marriage is just for show, and she feels this competition is all she has left. Very orginial movie, I highly recomment it!"
B00978SIJ6 I've been an Olivia Wilde fan since House so I saw she was in this and wanted to watch it. It was pretty good. I thought Wilde and Garner were really funny. The other actors were pretty good too, especially the dad of the girl when he was talking about the butter police. I'm not sorry I rented it but if I had a re-do, I probably wouldn't of spent 9.99 to rent it and would've waited until after it came out on DVD to rent it for cheaper. Overall, I enjoyed watching."
B00978SIJ6 An interesting comedy about a woman whose husband, a renowned butter sculpture retires and interferes with her plans for the Whitehouse. She ends up competing with her own butter skills against the talents of a displaced child.Just a tad over done with the potty mouth used as comedy. At least it was not slapstick except for a traffic encounter.On the positive side is the movie is packed with excellent actors that know how to make you see the characters that they are playing.Too bad the real sculptures only get credit in the closing credits.Destiny asks Brooke (Olivia Wilde) a person of ill repute \"Where do you work?\"\" Barns and Noble.\" I have gained a new respect for books."
B00978SIJ6 This movie was pretty funny!  It had a Little Miss Sunshine vibe, but was also heartwarming.  The main star (the little girl) was the break out star....cute funny and sweet rolled into one.  The whole cast was good, but I must say Jennifer Garner became her character. She transformed into the woman people love to hate. I found it interesting is that, unlike some movies today, it seemed to show the elistism/snobbiness of well intentioned liberals.  Usually it's just the right wing small minded who get made fun of in movies, but this one &#34;shared the wealth around.&#34;"
B00978SIJ6 I enjoy watching Jennifer Garner most times.  In this movie I found her to be a real B.... to this little girl.  She did a really good job of it."
B00978SIJ6 Seven dollars to rent a movie?  You could buy a DVD for $7 easily.  This is a rip off.  I watched this movie but found it horrible because the price was so high."
B00978SIJ6 From the director Jim Field Smith (\"She's Out of My League\", \"School of Horrors\") and writer Jason A. Micallef comes an ensemble comedy known as Butter.Featuring a talented cast which includes Jennifer Garner (\"Alias\", \"Juno\", \"Daredevil\"), Ty Burrell (\"Modern Family\", \"The Incredible Hulk\", \"National Treasure: Book of Secrets\"), Ashley Greene (\"Twilight\" films), Hugh Jackman (\"X-Men\" films, \"The Prestige\", \"Les Miserables\"), Olivia Wilde (\"TRON: Legacy\", \"House M.D.\", \"The Change-Up\"), Alicia Silverstone (\"Clueless\", \"Batman & Robin\", \"Vamp\") and Kristen Schaal (\"Toy Story 3&#8243;, \"Shrek Forever After\", \"Dinner for Schmucks\", \"The Muppets\").VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Butter\" is presented in anamorphic widescreen 2:35:1 and in English Dolby Digital 5.1.  It's important to note that any one wanting the best video and audio quality will want to purchase the Blu-ray release of \"Butter\".  But on DVD, picture quality for this film looks very good.  Colors are really good and I didn't detect any excessive artifacts or any problematic issues during my viewing of the film.  Audio quality is good as one can expect for a dialogue driven-film.  There is some ambiance use of the surround channels.Subtitles are in English SDH and in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Butter\" comes with the following special features:Deleted and Extended Scenes - (9:04) Featuring six deleted and extended scenes.Gag Reel - (5:15) The Bloopers from the film \"Butter\".EXTRAS:\"Butter\" comes with a cardboard slipcover.JUDGMENT CALL:\"Butter\" is the first film from actress Jennifer Garner's production company, Vandalia Films and also is the first screenplay written by Jason Micallef.The independent film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and it features a solid cast which includes Jennifer Garner, Ty Burrell, Hugh Jackman, Olivia Wilde, Ashley Greene, Alicia Silverstone to name a few.And what best than to create a drama around butter sculpting competitions?Featuring the American family of the mid-west and story about one woman wanting the prestige and becoming more than a trophy wife, while a 10-year-old African-American girl who has been bounced around from foster family to foster family and finds a family that she likes but also shows off her ability to craft with butter.And when you put these two against each other in a butter competition, the storyline becomes too predictable.  But with a talented line-up, you expect bigger things and sure enough, you get to see talents taken on roles that they have never been in before.  Olivia Wilde as a demanding stripper, Alicia Silverstone as an adoptive mother, Ashley Greene as the stepdaughter who despises her stepmother but loves getting intimate with the female stripper that had sex with her father and Hugh Jackman as a car salesman who hooks up with his former high school flame.So, the film benefits from its supporting cast but pretty much the film rides on the shoulders of Jennifer Garner, the domineering trophy wife who can't fathom losing the publicity when the Iowa State Fair asks her husband to step down from the annual butter sculpting competition because he's too good.  And unfortunately, the character of Laura Pickler (becomes a character you despise).  If anything, the only character that the viewer hopes would become successful is young Destiny (portrayed by Yara Shahidi).Destiny may have had the problematic life as an orphan but for this film, she is the shining character.  The young African-American girl who doesn't know where her real mother or family are but yet aspires to be a good foster child and also the best butter sculptist that she can be and win against the bitchy Laura Pickler.Both Garner and Shahidi do a great job portraying their characters but there is no way of saving this film from its very average screenplay.The film also goes far to show that despite the Pickler's looking like the ideal family, they are actually not.  Bob Pickler has an affair with a prostitute, his daughter gets intimate with the prostitute and Laura has a fling with her ex-boyfriend as an opportunity to compete at the Iowa State Fair.  Suffice to say, this \"perfect family\" is messed up.  And as you hope for some redeeming factor within this family, you realize, that you stop caring for either of them.  And the person you end up rooting for is young Destiny.Sure the film has a political message of a conservative vs. liberal storyline.  But it' also a film that plays things too safe and is too predictable.As for the DVD, the DVD has a few special features but for those wanting the best in picture and audio quality, will want to go for the Blu-ray release instead.As for \"Butter\", I found the whole Butter sculpting competition to be intriguing and like any competition out there, there will always be individuals who are too competitive and love the spotlight.  But while the storyline for \"Butter\" was OK, and the film is made more interesting by its ensemble cast of really well-known talents, but its the unknown talent, young Yara Shahidi that made this film worthwhile. Because among the amoral characters featured in \"Butter\", her character Destiny, is the most respectable, innocent character of the entire the film. And you can't help but want to root for her character.Overall, \"Butter\" is an average popcorn comedy, nothing more, nothing less."
B00978SIJ6 I have to give Jennifer Garner credit for playing a despicable character in sheep's clothing with such unfettered brio in this 2012 comedy, one that aspires to be a darkly eccentric political satire but ultimately becomes too soft-centered for its own good. That outcome is a real shame since the stellar cast is obviously quite game for something edgier, the women in particular, and the scabrous tone works well for at least the first half of the movie. Director Jim Field Smith and first-time writer Jason Micallef certainly make their political proclivities clear with their broad caricature of corn-belt values and status-hungry elitists who intend on attaining power any way they can. With her constantly pinched voice, crisp color-coordinated outfits, perfect hair and make-up and a triple strand of pearls strung tightly around her neck, Garner is obviously playing Laura Pickler as an amalgam of Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachman but with a more naked malevolence toward anyone who stands in her way toward the White House.Even though her congenial husband Bob, the Iowa State Fair's 15-time butter sculpting champion, is asked by the judges to bow out of the latest competition, Laura is not about to relinquish her powerful position as queen of the fair and decides to enter the contest herself. However, she faces unexpected competition from a ten-year-old African-American child named Destiny, who has been moving from one foster home to another with her packed suitcase in tow. She somehow maintains a level head about her life as she tries to figure out what her true talent is. The answer lies in butter. For most of the first hour, the film provides a lot of easy laughs at the expense of Middle America conservatism and Tea Party stereotypes. It was clever to cast Ty Burrell since he plays Bob as a slightly duller variation on his classic portrayal of dimly lit Phil onModern Family, but he's quickly relegated to the sidelines here. The first butter sculpting contest is set up quite amusingly with the addition of two other contestants: Carol-Ann, a devoted fan girl of Bob's played with ditzy dexterity by Kristen Schaal (30 Rock), and a vengeful, hard-edged stripper named Brooke, who is waiting for a $600 payment from Bob for services rendered.As an unsavory character who wants desperately to annihilate Laura's dreams of higher status, Olivia Wilde is a genuine comic revelation who almost steals the entire movie as Brooke. Having just seen her as the overly patient, put-upon girlfriend inPeople Like Us, I am surprised at how bracingly funny she is here in her 180-degree turn as a foul-mouthed nihilist trying to look tough riding on a girl's bicycle. Playing what has to be considered the too-good-to-be-true Obama figure, Yara Shahidi brings quiet depth to Destiny and makes her feeling of isolation palpable even as her foster parents show their unconditional love for her. As the liberal-minded couple who take her into their home, Rob Corddry (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) tamps down his antic comic style just enough to resonate, while Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) makes a welcome return as the one likeable grown woman in the story. Although the movie has a sharper edge than \"The Campaign\", Micallef's screenplay reaches a certain point where you begin to realize that there is little to Laura's motivations beyond her small-minded ambition.It's at this juncture in the story that Hugh Jackman shows up as her former flame Boyd Bolton, a successful car dealer who still holds a torch for Laura and colludes with her to ensure her victory at the fair. In only a few scenes, Jackman hams it up considerably, especially in a silly prayer scene. Phyllis Smith (Bad Teacher), on the other hand, has a few sharply funny moments as the continually flummoxed contest moderator. The final showdown feels rather repetitive with little variety in the build-up of suspense and a denouement that feels far too predictable and contrived to make the story's resolution feel like it was earned. Nevertheless, the central concept of butter sculpture as the means of driving the absurdist plot somehow works. Seeing all the blocks of yellow lard turn into hilariously inappropriate creations like Schindler's List, T-Rex Eating Girl, The Last Supper, and even JFK's assassination provides the film's biggest laughs. At the same time, in a dilemma that it shares with \"The Campaign\", I just wish the filmmakers maintained their initial audacity all the way through instead of slapping on an ending that lets the story sputter out insipidly."
B00978SIJ6 Tale about Bob and Lauren Pickler.  Bob has been a champion butter carver for 15 years and is asked to step down,we get to see some of his carvings including his version of 'The Last Supper.'  His wife does not want to let the glory go away.  Bob goes to find comfort at a local club and encounters a crazed dancer who eventually follows him home demanding $.  The daughter thinks she is great.Meanwhile there is an 11-year-old balck girl in need of a foster family and is taken in by A. Silverstone and her husband.  The girl wants to carve butter.There are four female entrants at the local level.  After a big lie that involves Hugh Jackman and caused me my one laugh they are to have a rematch at the state level, the scorned dancer is still involved and Jackman returns.Bad language and people talking to God, mention of the Butter Police. A character study, suprising collection of big-name talent. Something to watch.  Bad language and prayer.There are out-takes at the end that are somewhat funny likeThe Cannonball Run."
B00978SIJ6 The story is kind of lame and I lost interest halfway through. The story also does not makes much sense. Skip it!"
B00978SIJ6 We are in a small town in Iowa to witness the finals in the annual butter-carving contest. The perennial winner has agreed not to compete in the future, so his ambitious wife has stepped up to the plate for next year's competition. In the meantime we have a newcomer, a little girl who has discovered her own talent; her adoptive parents are totally supportive. (She hasn't unpacked her suitcase yet, because of her past history as a foster child.)The culture in small-town Iowa is naturally the butt of a lot of jokes from sophisticated Hollywood, but my favorite character is the car dealer who agrees to help that ambitious wife mess up that little girl's entry. As I watched, I kept thinking he reminded me of Hugh Jackman....Here are some of the players:* Ty Burrell (\"Modern Family\") is that talented (but now retired) sculptor. He hasn't been entirely faithful to...* Jennifer Garner (\"The Invention of Lying\") his wife who intended to use his string of victories to generate a political career.* Yara Shahidi (Lots of TV) is that talented newcomer to the butter-sculpting community.* Alicia Silverstone (Lots of TV) is the adoring new mother, happy to adopt such a beautiful little girl and help her express her inner sculptor.* Rob Corddry (\"Warm Bodies\") is the new daddy, supportive and proud of his bright little girl.* Olivia Wilde (\"Rush\") is the stripper who had a fling with the butter carving champion. She tells the little girl she works at Barnes & Noble.* ...and Hugh Jackman (\"Wolverine\") speaks pure Midwestern American. Whatta guy! His prayers to Jesus are heartfelt and very, very funny.This R-rated outing (language and sexual situations) is sappy and predictable, but who cares; it's heartwarming and satisfying. I got my copy through Amazon."
B00978SIJ6 Overall, I didn't care much for this film. It does have some highlights, like Hugh Jackman's portrayal of a pervy car-salesman, and the cute young girl named Destiny, but that's about it. Jennifer Garner and Ty Burrell have some funny moments, but they are just MOMENTS and can't carry the whole film. I actually found the whole \"let's make fun of middle-America\" thing a bit on the vicious side, and Olivia Wilde's character was just gross. I was glad that I didn't have to pay to see this one."
B00978SIJ6 Despite an impressive comic cast, I hadn't heard very many positives about \"Butter\" before I sat down to watch it. Maybe my expectations were set too low, because I actually thought this biting Midwestern satire worked just fine. It is never afraid to push the envelope of good taste, but it is also grounded by a certain gentleness and sweetness that is as unexpected as it is winning. Many contemporary satires are content to be as abrasive and confrontational as possible, so I thought the levels of shading in \"Butter\" really distinguished it from the pack. That's not to say that the movie has gone soft or lacks edge, it doesn't. It just works a fine balancing act between outrageous political incorrectness AND characters that you might actually care about. So, for me, \"Butter\" was a genuinely pleasant surprise.Of course, the premise of the film is absolutely irresistible. Set in the competitive and cut-throat world of butter carving, the screenplay attacks both obvious and less expected targets. Ty Burrell (invaluable on Modern Family) and Jennifer Garner play the first couple of the annual State Fair. Burrell has been the butter carving champion for fifteen consecutive years, and Garner has basked in the associated glory while rising to a level of community power. When Burrell is asked to sit out of this year's competition, this opens the door to new talent. Among them, Garner steps up as a amoral and manipulative contender. Also in the ring is an orphan girl (an effective Yara Shahidi) that seems like a butter carving prodigy. The two ladies stage an epic battle of skill and cunning, but the ruthless Garner doesn't intend to play fair. Who will emerge victorious? And will anyone remain unscathed from this battle of good versus evil?Garner is wildly over-the-top in the piece's biggest performance. It's a committed choice that is countered expertly by the more deadpan Shahidi. In many ways, the little girl is the heart and soul of the movie but she's never portrayed as a sap or an innocent. She's got her head firmly in the game. Burrell tones things down and is undeniably likable, even in a side plot about a rampaging stripper/mistress. Rod Corddry (creator of my favorite Childrens Hospital) and Alicia Silverstone, as Shahidi's foster parents, are also down-to-earth and supportive. As I said, the tone of the movie can be brutal--but there is a real heart in the center of the story. Some nice comic bits round out the principle players. Hugh Jackman has an unlikely supporting role as a cohort and coconspirator of Garners. And great character actresses Kristen Schaal (always brilliant) and Phyllis Smith (The Office) have scene stealing moments. All in all, I had quite a bit of fun with \"Butter.\" KGHarris, 12/12."
B00978SIJ6 Personally I hate it when people make grand sweeping statements. Rarely do I agree. However, in this case--I can say with certainty that of all of the movies I saw in 2012 (which was quite a lot), this was hands down the funniest. Every single character is perfection and the casting is brilliant yet mostly anti-type for most of the actors. Hugh Jackman is a blundering idiot. Jennifer Garner has a complex. Olivia Wilde is a money hungry stripper. Ty Burrell is hysterical, but actually his character is probably the most like the  ones he usually plays. The dialogue is usually just witty and subtle, yet I actually laughed out loud several times for some punch lines (getting me to laugh audibly while watching a movie usually never happens). I literally watched the entire movie with a happy smile on my face.Also, without getting into it--this movie has a real heart and warmth to it, aside from the comedy. The little girl with her adoptive parents is simply a beautiful story. And yet, it's not super melodramatic or even cheesy really. With so many over the top performances (Garner & Jackman especially), somehow the very real human sentiments come through and hit home. Garner is ridiculous, and yet isn't one dimensional. We actually feel kind of sorry and empathize a little bit with her at the end even though she's sort of awful.I've read a couple of reviews though that think this movie is mocking \"Middle America\" or even familial units. I don't see that at all. I'm from the deep south, and while we don't have butter competitions--we do have some other crazy things that people here take just as seriously. And that's not a bad thing. In my opinion, the movie might play the butter competition for laughs--and yet isn't saying that it's a stupid or evil thing either. It's possible to really enjoy these zany things, take them seriously--and yet find the humor in them as well. As far the family aspect, I think the movie tries and succeeds in contrasting a less than ideal family (Garners) with the adoptive parents family that really showcase the beauty of family.This is not a movie for everyone though. For instance, the \"Harriet Tubman\" line is only funny if you actually know who she is. There are several references like that in the movie. Not necessarily specific people, but (without sounding ridiculously pretentious)things and concepts that are generally a little more high-brow than a lot of whats out there in comedy land. This isn't slapstick comedy where people just fall down a lot and fart loudly or get super stoned and jump in pools. Basically, I think this movie is either going to really hit your funny bone--or you will think it's super boring. There's not a lot of in between. All I can suggest is that you give it a try."
B00978SIJ6 I had heard many good things about the movie BUTTER before I had the chance to see it. Critics were treating it fairly nice and word of mouth via numerous magazines said good things as well. So I went in expecting something quite different than what I got.The world of BUTTER revolves around the annual Butter Carving Championship held at the Iowa State Fair. For the past 15 years the winner has remained Bob Pickler (Ty Burrell). Ty is a good natured man who has done an amazing job with his sculpting, his last being a full sized replica of the last supper. Bob is married to Laura (Jennifer Garner), a prim, proper and respectable leader in their community who feels that Bob's 15 years of winning may lead them to greater things like being the Governor or perhaps even one day the President. Not only is Laura a respectable member of the community, she is one that is feared as well. No one will mess with Laura or what she wants.When the championship committee makes the decision to ask Bob to step down and let someone else win for once, Laura goes on a rampage. She views it as the world trying to take down her and her family, never once thinking that perhaps it would be encouraging for others to be involved. When Bob refuses to enter, Laura does what she considers the next best thing and enters herself in the hopes of retaining the family legacy.But this won't be the easy win she expects. A storyline running alongside the Pickler family is that of Destiny (Yara Shahidi). A young black girl in an orphanage passed from one foster family to another, Destiny has landed with a new couple, Ethan and Julie (Rob Corrdry and Alicia Silverstone). When Destiny happens across Bob and his sculpture at an exhibition she is amazed and picks up on carving butter herself. A natural at it, she decides she wants to enter the competition as well.Also entering the competition is Brooke (Olivia Wilde), a stripper that Bob had a fling with and who he owes $600. In an attempt to make his life worse than it already is, Brooke continues to show up at Bob's house demanding her money and finally enters the competition just to spite Laura.So far this sounds like a decent satire of the whole competition scenario that we've had before in films. Instead we get something a little different that actually turns out to be a bit more hateful than one would expect. I mean granted when it comes to movies made about the Midwest people will always be portrayed as closed minded and redneck, the whole clinging to their guns and Bibles sort. For some reason Hollywood finds a lot of humor in that. While they continue to laugh uproariously at those sorts of things I find that it's more of an easy out and lazy comedy than anything.This is not to say the film fails completely. At the start it truly has some funny moments. It's well made and does feature some really good performances. But then somewhere along the way it veers off and decides to get nasty and mean instead of funny. Laura goes from being an obsessed housewife with delusions of grandeur to what Hollywood thinks of right wingers. She's spouts off profanities when the mood suits her, feels she is entitled to a place of power and prestige, displays racists tendencies and will do any and everything she can to retain the family title. Her character becomes hateful and manipulative. Anyone that opposes her, including a stripper, is offered up as just and righteous.The movie changes along with the character of Laura Pickler. It changes from a movie that has some great humor in it to one that seems more determined to ridicule those the writer doesn't agree with instead. In those attempts to ridicule we see displayed some of the laziest writing around resorting to stereotypes better left to online memes rather than a feature film.One odd thing about those in Hollywood. Anyone who has actually lived in the Midwest always talks about how much they loved their childhood, yet they always seem to find it necessary to insult or ridicule where they came from. And for those who have never visited let alone lived in the Midwest, they always feel they know exactly what it's like to live there. Unfortunately with rare exceptions, they almost never get it right. This holds true in BUTTER.A great example appears in outtakes that roll during the final credits. Ethan and Destiny have a scene where they're sitting in his car and she tells him she's afraid of going in to enter the competition. He begins to tell her that there are worse things that could happen than just entering. Things like piranhas learning to walk and entering the building at the same time to attack. These are things he says to break down her fear and give her the courage to enter. It's a nice scene and in the movie plays well. But in the outtakes one of the scenarios that Destiny offers up is \"It could be worse; it could be a Republican fund raiser\". Gee, isn't that a subtle display of where the thoughts of this writer lay.The potential for a great movie was there. Instead it resorted to the cheap laughs it had that are actually not funny unless you hate Republicans. If so, you will love this movie. If you're a bit more open minded and think there are good and bad people on both sides of the coin, then this movie will offer a few laughs and then toss them all aside to gain political points with Hollywood."
B00978SIJ6 Cut from a similar cloth as BEST IN SHOW, writer Jason Micallef's BUTTER is a hysterical, twisted, political comedy that pokes fun at the folks in Iowa to whom butter carving is their whole life.When long-reigning champion butter sculptor Ty Burrell is asked to step aside, obsessive wife Jennifer Garner decides to enter the state contest herself in order to maintain the family's \"butter spotlight\".  However, her virtually guaranteed win is thwarted when the talented Yara Shahidi, a ten-year-old African American orphan, enters the competition and wins the hearts of the judges.  Also competing, if only to irk Garner, is stripper/hooker Olivia Wilde, who had a fling with Burrell and is now stalking him for the money she says he owes her.Garner is determined to win the state contest, thus she seduces her dense former boy friend, Hugh Jackman, to do some dirty tricks in order to insure her victory.Deftly directed by Jim Field Smith, the talented cast includes Alicia Silverstone and Rob Corddry as Yara's adoptive parents and Ashley Greene.The Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a gag reel, plus deleted and extended scenes.BUTTER is a hoot! Michael B. Druxman"
B00978SIJ6 This is a silly, slightly offbeat comedy that has some charm and some laughs Good enough for a Sat. night escape. For us typical men, the film stars Jennifer Garner, Olivia Wilde and Alicia Silverstone who are all nice to look at and it features Yara Shahidi as an adorable young orphan we can all root for."
B00978SIJ6 Ty Burrell is essentially the same character (Bob Pickler) that he plays on TV's \"Modern Family\" (Phil Dunphy).  That is, he's a bit of a doofus whose claim to fame is being the butter carving champion of Iowa.  After numerous wins, Bob is forced to retire in order to give someone else a chance.  The carving knife is handed over his trophy wife, Laura.Channeling congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachman, Jennifer Garner gives a performance unlike anything you've seen her do in the past.  She's angry, determined and full of red state entitlement.  Her primary competition turns out to be a 10 year old foster child named Destiny (Yara Shahidi) living with a local couple (Alicia Silverstone and Rob Corddry).  Like Garner, Corddry plays his part dramatically straight and without the usual biting humor he wields.The film is a stinging satire of Middle America values and manages to produce its share of chuckles along the way.  Most of those come from Olivia Wilde as Brooke, a stripper and part time prostitute who had an interrupted liaison with Bob.  She was never compensated so shows up on his doorstep much to his dismay.  Eventually she even hooks up with Bob's teenage daughter (Ashley Green) from a former marriage, in order to get what she feels she is due.  And she enters the butter carving contest.The cast also includes a doughy Hugh Jackman as a former high school sweetheart of Laura.  Laura exchanges sexual pleasure with him in order to persuade him to influence the contest.  While Laura has contempt for Brooke's use of sex for money, she sees no problem with her own use of it to get the little girl out of the way.  Directed by Jim Field Smith (\"She's out of My League\"), the film does seem to drift from family to family and from drama to comedy with little cohesion.  Stay focused on the evil Laura and tramp-with-a-heart Brooke and you'll have a good time."
B00978SIJ6 I know...another silly parody of obsessive midwesterners with the quirk factor turned up to 11?  Yes and no.  There is genuine humor to be found here and some unexpected drama.  I wonder if I'm the only viewer that detected shades of the 2008 Hillary versus Obama showdown?  At least the long term goal in this story was to be recognized as the best butter carver rather than tyranny by massive government debts."
B00978SIJ6 Could you imagine Jennifer's life she keeps getting pregnant and has to deal with Ben Affleck and his non political political campaigning plus she has to cook for Matt Damon and his brood every Sunday night because you know they all get together for Sunday Night Dinner and well I would do this film too just to get away from all that."
B00978SIJ6 \"Butter\" (2012 release; 90 min.) brings a look at the suburban culture in Iowa City, exemplified by the annual butter sculpture competition. We meet Bob (played by Ty Burrell), who after 15 years as the reigning champ of the annual competion, decided to retire, much to the dismay of his wife Laura(played bu Jennifer Garnes who also co-produced the movie). Laura decides to carry on the family tradition and enters the competition, despite having no previous experience. We also meet Destiny, a 10 year old African-American girl who has been moved from foster home to foster home, and now is getting new foster parents Ethan and Julie (played by Rob Corddry Alicia Silverstone). Destiny discovers that she has an amazing talent for butter-sculpting and she too enters the competition. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: (1) the movie brings a parallel look on the suburban culture, where everyone seems to forget how good they have it and yet complain about a lot of small and unimportant things, while also providing some insights on the fate of foster children, in this case a 10 yr. old black girl in the midst of an overwhelmingly white community. When Destiny begins attending school at the Iowa City Country Day School, she cannot believe how nice all the kids in her class are to her. Comments Destiny: \"Are these crackers for real?\", ha! But there are more  serious undertones when we learn about Destiny's mom, whom she can barely remember. (2) This movie is a labor of love for Jennifer Garnes, who stars and produces. Garnes looks astonishingly good and brings one of her best leading performances in quite a while. (3) There are several other noteworthy performances, none more than Yara Shahidi as the 10 yr. old Destiny, but check out also Hugh Jackman in a small role as Laura's one time HS sweetheart and Olivia Wilde as Brooke, the hooker with whom Bob gets involved. (4) Any movie that finds a way to get Passion Pit's \"Little Secrets\" in its soundtrack is a-okay with me!\"Butter\" is a quirky little movie that delivers some fine moments, b
B00978SIJ6 Cute movie with a unique plot, but far too predictable and often times bland.  The little girl makes the movie, though Jennifer Garners acting is superb.  Not the best, but definitely not a bad movie.  It wasn't worth the Watch While It's In Theaters price though.  I would wait until it is cheaper."
B00978SIJ6 Still not 100% sure how I feel about BUTTER.  Not butter butter, but the film starring Jennifer Garner, Ty Burrell and Hugh Jackman!  I liked it, just not sure how much - it's a quirky indie film with a freaking BRILLIANT performance by Jennifer Garner (who I have new respect for, after watching this), who plays Laura, an ambitious (and fairly nutso) woman in Iowa whose laid-back and henpecked husband Bob (Ty Burrell) has won the local and state butter-carving (yes, I said butter-carving) competitions the last 15 years in a row.  Laura's sees this unbreakable record as her and Bob's way into the governor's mansion, but when officials suggest that Bob retire and give someone else a chance, Laura's hopes threaten to go up in flames - until she decides she must go into competition herself, to save what investment she's made in her and Bob's future.Unfortunately for Laura, this time around she faces some truly stiff competition in the form of a young African-American girl named Destiny, an orphan who's been shuffled from one set of foster parents to another all her life.  Destiny, quiet and introspective and incredibly creative, is a true artist with butter - which brings out the sociopath in Laura, who will do pretty much ANYTHING to make sure the butter sculpting title stays in the family, even when an angry prostitute that Bob has yet to pay enters the competition just to drive Laura nuts, too.The film is bizarre, if you haven't already figured that out, but also (at times) very funny, and holds together I think because of Jennifer Garner's terrific work as Laura.  Hugh Jackman, as a car salesman Laura used to boff in high school, has a role that's pivotal but too small to really ho him justice, and Yara Shahidi as Destiny is definitely a treat, holding her own with Garner when she's at her nuttiness.Not everyone will like 'Butter' but I did.  It's odd, quirky, farce-like, and the hooker's storyline goes on a bit too long (although Olivia Wilde, as Brooke, does great with the role, every time she's on screen).  If you like odd little indie comedies that seem to take the \"left of center\" road, you should like this one as I did."
B00978SIJ6 Bob (Ty Burrell) has been the Iowa state butter sculptor champion for 15 years straight, making fine sculptures such as \"The Last Supper\" and \"Newt on a Horse.\" The state fair has politely asked him to step aside and let someone else win. His overly straight, June Clever clone, wife Laura (Jennifer Garner) with a foul mouth objects and decides to carry on the family tradition and enter the contest herself. Her step daughter is excellently played by Ashley Greene. Bob seeks comfort in a stripper/prostitute (Olivia Wilde) who gets involved with the contest and also has some great swagger music.Meanwhile a young 10 year old African-American girl, Destiny (Yara Shahidi), is bounced around foster homes. She is overly mature and has taken a shine to butter sculpturing, which her foster parents (Alicia Silverstone and Rob Corddry) encourage, but think is a bit odd. I think you can guess the where this competition is going.The film is exceedingly funny as it satirizes American life, yet at the same time has heart without being too drippy or a chick flick. The script had great characters, even minor characters such as Carol Ann played by the always comical Kristen Schaal. A great film for the adults, and might make a good date night flick. The end has a blooper reel. The outtakes and extended scenes are worth a peek, but not as good as the main feature.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, girl/girl action. No nudity."
B0098G756O This movie has a funny cast, but it is anything but funny.  No wonder this movie didn't make any money at the theater."
B0098G756O it's a hilarious film. but if your family bears any resemblance, be prepared to cringe as much as you laugh."
B0098G756O Terrible movie, no redeeming qualities, turned it off without finishing. Cannot understand who would give 4 stars, not any good"
B0098G756O Not high drama but a load of fun and laughs.  It's worth watching just to see &#34;Jax&#34; as a regular guy."
B0098G756O Pretty ridiculous but ultimately I laughed out loud quite a few times. It's not a thinker but very enjoyable. I'd definitely watch it again. Chris ODowd is so so funny and Charlie Hunnam was great. I genuinely felt bad for his character. So what if some of the plot points were completely unlikely to happen in real life!"
B0098G756O Very funny in its own offbeat way. We enjoyed it far more than we expected. Weren't too sure what to expect since no one in the group had heard of it but turned out to be very enjoyable. Recommend it."
B0098G756O I had never heard of this movie before and after seeing the preview, my husband and I decided to watch it."
B0098G756O Me and my daughter really enjoyed this-lotsa laughs! Wished the extras included outtakes...bummer. But the cuts were good...one great decision the director (kudos Jordan Roberts) made was replacing Ron Perlman for the mother in the last phone call scene...not only did it add to the \"love story\" bit...but it added to the \"evening with Phillis\" - made it look as though they \"became close\" enough to have a conversation on relationships....hilarious! Loved it!"
B0098G756O I could name dozens of rom-coms from the last decade that this one liberally steals from, but what would be the point?  Perhaps I watch too many comedies.  What should be a simple boy meets girl story is complicated by all sorts of wacky, twisted, and clueless peripheral characters.  Each obstacle to their relationship seems contrived, like a 1978 tv episode of \"What's Happening?\" without the laugh track."
B0098G756O This show was two hours of my life that i will never get back. I kept watching thinking that surly the main character would grow a spine and kick his abusive toxic family to the side..but no! He just keeps coming back for more with that sad puppy look in his eye. I found myself yelling insults at his family for him. I would steer clear of this one."
B0098G756O The internal plot line is conventional with the conflict between brothers but the way it plays out and the cast are terrific."
B0098G756O This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen  and I very much regret spending the money for it. I had high hopes for it because of the actors involved but we stopped watching because of how totally stupid it was.  It was a total waste of money and time.  It was just unbelievably bad."
B0098G756O I am confused about the hype and raves for this film. It is a wanna-be quirky independent film using trite jokes and unreal situations in a world that doesn't require a release form. We are told that Bruce has spent his life torturing and filming his brother Frankie from the film blurb. We get to see one quick episode, hear about a second one, that really had nothing to do with Bruce and the movie is about a third one that again, Bruce (Chris O'Dowd) just happens to film.The whole set up and building of characters was done in a very poor fashion. The get together of Frankie(Charlie Hunnam) and Lassie (Lizzy Caplan) was slightly humorous, but there was no good follow up. Bruce was extremely unlikeable. Frankie only slightly less so. The characte
B0098G756O \"How is Jack Knowles seeing a movie of a drunken woman hitting me with her bike helping you get your dream Bruce?\" Frankie's (Hunnam) brother Bruce (O'Dowd) has just got out of prison and is back in his life. Frankie is not happy about this. His whole life Bruce has been filming Frankie in the worst possible situations. When Frankie has an embarrassing night with a woman he just met his brother films that too. This simple act spirals out of control and ends up affecting everyone involved, and some who aren't. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie but it wasn't this. The movie is funny and I did laugh a few times but it was different then I thought it would be. The cast is funny and the dialog is funny but it is borderline offensive so be warned if you are easily offended. I don't want to say too much because this is the kind of movie that each scene builds on itself and saying something will ruin the flow but it is funny, just different. Overall, not bad and worth seeing unless you are easily offended. I give it a B-."
B0098G756O I rented this because it had an interesting premise.  I think they could've done more with this.  I really wanted to like it, but I was mostly bored."
B0098VV4NE The movie was alot like Lake Eden except Lake Eden was a bit more \"shocking\" since the people tormenting were young (although I did prefer the movie Them).  The plot is very simple...a group of women go camping and end up terrorized.  The movie does try to give an element of surprise that the killer could be one person...ahh but maybe not?? But the surprise element wasn't very surprising but at least it tried.  It would have been nice to have seen more of a struggle with the boyfriend but it is what it is and it kept me entertained while at work.  I would like to see a movie where the victim goes for help as opposed to going back and trying to save her friend(s) but I guess if that happened there wouldn't be much of a movie.  At least the girl(s) did put up a fight which is commendable as opposed to the running and tripping over a branch and laying there screaming until killed.I do think the movie was well made.  The viewer could see what was going on.  I never thought that was a big issue until I came across some movies that were so darkly lit where it was difficult to tell what was going on.  The pacing was descent and the actors did a good job."
B0098VV4NE The scenery was beautiful,the cast was good ,the acting for the most part above par for the budget.It was very brutal and violent but there wasn't a lot of gore involved although there was lot's of blood and  a few mild effects.I always like the extra gore in these films because basically as lovers of this genre that's what we like to see coupled with the other elements I mentioned before.There are lot of rape scenes but it plays into the heart of the plot,They weren't so bad that I couldn't watch the entire scenes like the rape scenes in Last House on the Left or I Spit On Your Grave  but they were still brutal.It's a good story and an entertaining film and the ending is unexpected and exciting.Think Eden Lake Meets Resurrection County.."
B0098VV4NE This movie needs to &#34;Take a HIKE&#34; right on out duh Amazon instant video section, and never come back....it is plain out too bad to even explain why...."
B0098VV4NE The film opens with people screaming and running around getting killed by an off screen slasher. After that brief teaser opening, 5 girls take off to go camping. Kate (Zara Phythian) is five days back from Afghanistan (guess how her training plays in this). The girls drive, then leave their convertible with the top down to go hike and camp several hours away. The girls are armed with shorts, boots, back packs, and military issue undergarments that can double as a swim suit. It isn't long before they meet some cute boys and become flirty.If you were awake the first few minutes then you know where this goes.This is a &#34;me-too&#34; woods slasher. It offers nothing new. The characters were not well established. Their personality was bland. It was killing for the sake of killing. No cannibals, inbreeding, or a sportsman club. Boring.Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape, nudity (male and female)"
B0098VV4NE good solid movie.....typical storyline but i still enjoyed it.....nice thrill ride at the end of the movie...who will survive...who wont & what happens to the sole survivor.......good watch..............nice ending..........and it does make you wonder what can happen when u go hiking.....not that this will really happen but u never know - makes ur mind wonder....oh my :)"
B0098VVF1A It's a good series with nice plot and interesting, likable characters. I just watched through 17 episodes today and I find them interesting. The art only in few places isn't perfect, like when the nose seems to be wrong and legs of these cybernetic humans are so very long and the bodies are so much shorter than of real humans, but maybe that was done on purpose. I heard that Disney was or maybe still is about to cancel this cartoon. That would be a great shame. These episodes are great and they kept me entertained. You might enjoy them as well. I am really looking forward for the last 2 episodes to finish this season and I am truly looking forward for season 2! It's a cartoon, not to be missed!"
B0098VVF1A Yes, I'll have to agree with a majority here. I began watching this on Netflix recently by word of mouth & it's a really good show. The cg animation style reminds me of Aeon Flux or some other European style graphic art with it's kinetic colors & elongated body's. It features an intelligent story to compliment the equally enthralling visuals. Highly recommended to scifi or animation fans. Not unlike Fringe, this is surely to become a fan favorite too. A+"
B0098VVF1A Just Like Ctenosaura said we as Tron fans need to show Disney how much we want this show back and alas Americans vote with their dollars so buy the season, write a review, U will not be disappointed."
B0098VVF1A Tron has set a whole new level for other animated shows to match. Not only is it visually spectacular, the story line links the two movies and provides us with a new hero, Beck.Tron (the character) makes appearances throughout the series to help Beck plot a revolution against Clu and his army of evil programs. This series follows Beck and his attempts to undermine the iron fist of Clu and his minions. It has an amazing cast of voice actors, including Elijah Wood, Mandy Moore, and guest starring Donald Faizon.I don't consider myself a huge Tron fan by any means. The original was made before I was born, but I did manage to watch it in its entirety (my wife fell asleep). My major experience was Tron: legacy, which I enjoyed more than the original (I'll be stoned for that comment, I'm sure...) Tron: Uprising surpasses both of them, in my opinion. I was sad to find out Disney XD wants to cancel the series before it even has a chance to take off!And FYI, it was recently added to Netflix Instant. It might be cheaper to join for a month than buy each episode on Amazon."
B0098VVF1A This is one of the better cartoon shows out there.  I'm just sad this is not being renewed for season 2.  The story lines, graphics, and music are good."
B0098VVF1A Ok so let me first say i am a tron fan, now that being said this cartoon is one of the best cartoons i have seen in years. It manages to capture and the elements that make a truly great cartoon, the serious moments, the intense action, and the most important part that a lot of cartoons miss the mark on and that the consequences for the things you do.  I would more than recommend this, i would say you owe it to yourself to at the very least give the show a try.As a side note, if you view threw your tv and a surround sound its just increases its awesomeness."
B0098VVF1A Set somewhere between the movies TRON and TRON:LEGACY, TRON:UPRISING follows the adventures and misadventures of a program named Beck. During his fight with CLU, Tron was severely damaged and isn&#8217;t quite the same program he used to be. He needs time to heal, regroup, and build a resistance and ends up outside of one of the farthest outlying cities on the grid, Argon City. Meanwhile, after seeing a friend killed, Beck begins doing some civil disobedience after hours and eventually meets Tron. Tron agrees to not only allow Beck to use his name, but to actually take his image by using his disc. Tron then mentors and trains Beck in the hopes that he will be able to lead the revolution against CLU. Tron lives!Following styles used in TRON:LEGACY, TRON:UPRISING is a visually gorgeous panorama of neon colors. I think the series is worth watching just for the visuals alone.Of course, there&#8217;s much more to the series than that. Overall, the series is well developed. It does a good job of creating characters, providing backstories for those characters, and further developing those characters. Well, at least for the protagonists. Other than Paige, most of the antagonists are cardboard cut-outs. There are a few episodes that suffer from repeat-scenario-syndrome (same scenario with slightly different villain), but these episodes are few. Most of the stories are really entertaining, especially for only being twenty-two minutes long. There&#8217;s also a few surprises here and there along the way.Overall, TRON:UPRISING is a fairly entertaining animated series that both children and adults can appreciate. It has a lot of appeal to Tron fans, but is also something that a person who has never seen either of the two Tron movies can watch."
B0098VVOGG I'll admit it. I watch Hoarders for just one reason, to get motivated to declutter and clean my home.  &#34;Hoarders&#34; is among the very best for that.  While most hoarding-type shows are sensational and consistently extreme, this series often features people who started out just a little over-the-line in terms of owning too much stuff.Those are the shows that get me to hit &#34;pause&#34; and go weed out the kitchen cupboard, or under the bathroom sink, or that stack of books that won't fit in the bookcase.It's a reminder that we often lose sight of how cluttered our homes are... how easy it is to say &#34;I'll find a place for that,&#34; or &#34;I might have a use for that, later,&#34; and end up with stacks of unused items.  They aren't trash, but that's what makes them difficult to let go of.Anyway, I'm really enjoying this series via Amazon Prime, and it's keeping me ahead of the clutter."
B0098VVOGG Feel sad for these people and their obsession but very happy they receive some much needed help.  Kinda hard for me to watch."
B0098VVOGG it's an interesting show. you get to see people at their worst, exposed of their obsession with hoarding. warning: do not eat while watching. ick."
B0098VVOGG I really enjoy watching hoarders. Most of the people have a problem others are just lazy! Either way it makes me want to get up and clean my house.. Ha Ha!"
B0098VVOGG This show made me get to work and keep my house in order. I did not know that it is a sickness when you hoard. I enjoyed watching the program thanks again"
B0098VVOGG Hard for me to watch.  I view it when I need motivation to clean my own house and throw stuff out.  How can anyone care so much about &#8220;stuff?&#8221;  They put &#8220;things&#8221; over people and that is the most disturbing part."
B0098VVOGG This helps me finish my projects and clean..... ewwwwwI can still see my floor and I have a clean kitchen (basically).  I would get more done if I could just stop watching hoarders"
B0098VVOGG To make a series out of people with this condition is repetitive. It gets quite tiring to watch this show which almost makes fun out of people who have this condition.A Special about this condition with helpful hints to the &#34;hoarders' and their families may have been better."
B0098VVOGG I have never before watched an episode of Hoarders that literally made me physically ill to watch. I generally love to watch Hoarders while cleaning house-it inspires me-but this was darned close to unwatchable. It's hard to understand the level of mental illness involved, and I admire the professionals who managed somehow to set aside their shock and disgust and treat this objectively as a bonafide mental disorder. I still feel physically ill when I recall this episode. I learned not to judge-or laugh- at what, at first glance may seem to be massively out of control hoarding and realize we have no right to judge or giggle at serious mental illness."
B0098VVOGG I really don't know what the attraction is to this show, but I serial watch each new season when it becomes available.  It is sad to see some of the tragedies of people's lives that cause them to live this way, but also encouraging to see them begin to overcome their issues and regain normal lives.  And I am always motivated to get up and clean after I watch it. Lol."
B0098VVOGG The show features two hoarders per episode and shows how successful the families, or sometimes individuals, were in making their homes more habitable. There's quite the range in degrees of hoarding. We're learning just how much of a disease hoarding really is. It's so sad to watch some people agonize to clean up their places, only to have them not get the help they need and repeat the cycle again."
B0098VVOGG I've been watching hoarders for years.  I often think it's to feel good about my house.  During this season, I found more direct dealing with mental health issues.  More families were involved and more families were saying enough is enough.  It's a little hard to watch those particular episodes but I think it was harder to watch older ones where the families could do nothing."
B0098VVOGG As good as the rest of the Hoarders seasons.  Prepare yourself for the lady that &#34;freezes&#34; her dead cats (yuck!)"
B0098VVOGG I chose that rating because it is very sad that a person has such a problem.  Now if my house gets messed up once in a while, I don't feel bad. Ha!"
B0098VVOGG I have heard from a lot of people about this show, so I was curious to see a few episodes for myself.  It lives up to the descriptions of my friend, but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the &#34;hoarders.&#34;  The show is seriously over dramatized, which isn't unexpected for a reality TV show, but I would expect more from the therapists, who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras."
B0098VVOGG The people trapped in hoarding have mostly gained my sympathy. There are a few exceptions, those too self centered or who are plain mean, but for the most part the people in these vignettes are very damaged and mentally ill. I find it especially heartbreaking when they decide to clean up their act only to find their homes so damaged by neglect that they are no longer inhabitable. Sometimes it's laziness, sometimes it's mental illness but it's always interesting. I'm glad not to be a hoarder!"
B0098VVOGG My husband and I are recovering hoarders.  We met Cory Chalmers long before we had seen or heard of the A&E; Program &#34;Hoarders&#34;.  Cory and the Steri-Clean staff changed our life.  They helped us come to terms with our hoarding, and helped us learn tools to grow beyond the mess.I watch Hoarders religiously ::: to remind me where I used to be, and keep me from returning.  Change is possible for hoarders ::: there is hope for people like us.  FYI - We no longer live in a hoarded out mess, and have no intention of returning to that lifestyle.Kudos to Hoarders  for it's inspirational message!"
B0098VVOGG This is not very interesting unless you have nothing else better to do and are bored out of your mind by other programming. I guess it could be something you'd do on Saturday night with a beer in your hand and a spouse who's snoring in his chair next to you!?!"
B0098VVOGG Patty started hoarding when her philandering husband leaves her.  She has two sons.  The cleaning guy with the chin dimple tried to sleep in her house, but couldn't to it.  It was yucky and funny seeing his head resting close to some fecal matter.  Patty has two sons, one married to a man.  ND doesn't allow same-sex marriage, but I'm so happy that the show always refered to Cody as a husband and not some euphemism.  The mother and brother called the husband all kinds of names, but the show doesn't explain why the husband is a bad person.  If anything many rainbow-flag men would have left lovers with crazy family members in a second.  Once the house is clean, the therapist encourages the owner to deal with her feelings.  I don't understand how an empty house makes a woman deal with being dissed by her ex-spouse.  The (straight) son at times has his T-shirt's msg blurred and at other times is seen wearing the Gabriel Iglesias shirt saying \"I'm not fat; I'm fluffy.\"  I'm a fatty too and I can empathize with the family, but they did seem morbidly obese.  I do worry about their healths.In the other fact pattern, the woman of the house owes about $50,000 in credit card debt due to hoarded objects.  Her husband had every reason in the world to leave her, but you can tell he doesn't want to in his heart.  The woman had the nerve to say she never wanted sons, although she has 4 of them.  The crew is nice enough to clean her house and she yells, \"I don't like the color of these walls.\"  After all her drama, the therapist said, \"She may seem like a jerk to others, but that's the disease controlling her.\"  I'm skeptical of that.  It felt like passing the blame.  This woman was just really nasty and when she abandoned by everybody who could have loved her, I think she's going to be quite rueful.  She cries and yells, \"I hate being disappointed.\"  I was thinking, \"Then maybe you shouldn't set unrealistic standards for others!\"  I kinda wonder if she has anti-social personality disorder."
B0098VVOGG Great show.  I enjoy watching this show  Never realized how many hoarders there actually are and how difficult it is for them to get rid of junk!"
B0098VVOGG The stories on Hoarders are always interesting, but sometimes the mental condition of the hoarder is simply depressing to watch. The ones who mistreat animals are especially bad, since the animals have no choice and no advocate."
B0098VVOGG I am Hoarders obsessed, I watch all of them, from any producers/station --- why? Because I've seen it in my family and if floors me still, I so want to understand where they are coming from -- and it shows me that part of my family was just dealing with a sickness --- I think most of them have passed away now -- it was that older generation that went through the depression, my grandmother and her siblings all were hoarders."
B0098VVOGG I find this show amazing to watch, due to the mental illness that keeps people prisoners of they own doing.  Like so many addictions though, very few of the people featured on the show will be able to break the cycle.  And that to me, makes me feel badly for them and their family and friends.  However, if it helps only one, then I believe the show is worth it. :)"
B0098VVOGG It's a good show and you learn about this psychological disease that affect so many people. But the show can be slow and not as compelling: Needs edited down."
B0098VVOGG The first few episodes are interesting, but then it becomes repetitive. Not a bad show, just to much of the same for me."
B0098VVOGG I do not watch reality shows because most of the time people are portrayed displaying the worst possible behavior. Hoarders show people that are dealing with a mental illness. As the team works with the hoarder to clean up their property, they allow the hoarder dignity and compassion. Each hoarder has their own story but each person has such difficulty detaching from their &#34;treasures&#34;. Yesterday, I found out that there is a house just five houses from mine that could be shown on the Hoarders show."
B0098VVOGG I am a social worker and counselor who specializes in family violence and also case manager for adults at risk. I have been watching all the seasons of this fascinating show. What interests me in particular is how the therapists interact, establish trust, and help the 'hoarder' work through this disorder in a remarkable non-judgmental way. It is also very interesting to hear the 'hoarder's rationale for keeping things, and the loss and trauma that triggered them to start hoarding. In most of the episodes, I don't know how Matt, Dorothy, and Cory can deal patiently with these very determined and deluded people...most of them so angry and abusive when they sense the loss of control when their hoard is being disposed of, they seem very hard and resistant to work with and help. I have watched almost all of the seasons, but this one in particular featured 'hoarders' who were very mentally ill, in my professional opinion. This really makes me wonder how their aftercare went, and if it was successful. I like that the show doesn't always have a happy ending. Some ppl are so submerged in the 'hoarding' syndrome, it's doubtful they can change. ie: Hanna and her family."
B0098VVOGG just crazy some of these people living like that its horrible and sad but it is a sickness and I feel bad that some of these people and need help but cant get it."
B0098VVOGG Not overly impressed with the show -- it's just like every other Hoarder show. Some a little more disgusting than others. Pick those ones for the shock value only.Here's how it goes:&#34;People who hoard have issues and they usually wait until it's so far gone that they a) are getting evicted by their landlord or b) the county has deemed the house/apartment/trailer uninhabitable.&#34; That's the message through and through.The hoarder always has some reason for their behavior  and of course is reluctant to make any changes -- this goes on for at least a half hour. There is a crazy family dynamic going on where family members are estranged from the hoarder, mad as can be and &#34;don't want nothing to do&#34; with the hoarder. They all haven't spoken for a long time.  Soooo,  bring in some specialist in the psychological issues of hoarding (really? there is such a thing? Well, now apparantly there IS! What an idiot job... sorry about wasting your perfectly good educationon a TV show. Probably getting paid great and it serves your ego oh-so-well to be the 'expert')Then the &#34;clean up crew&#34; (who look and sound like they are always advertising their services) show up and make predictible  comments on the mess of it all. Then they done protective gear and start the clean up job.There might be a crisis moment at the point the clean up is underway. Of course, there is a serious time crunch of like, oh... say: 48 hours. It's so serious at this point, because the hoarder was so reluctant for months, years... whatever... but no matter....the hoarder starts freaking out and has second thoughts about getting rid of some piece of cardboard or the bucket of poop (seriously, this was in one of the episodes I watched!!) and everything halts while the family gets ticked off again, walks out, vowing that they are DONE with this nonsense. Bring in that specialist and have a come-to-reason meeting.... on we go with the clean up.Everything turns out good in the end. Or maybe not. To be honest, I watched two shows and just ended up feeling disgusted that main stream entertainment has turned into such a freak show. It must be the &#34;train wreck&#34; mentally.And there are SEVERAL shows like this -- some are &#34;Extreme Hoarder&#34; shows and some are &#34;Just Hoarder&#34; shows. It should just be a matter of time before the &#34;Relapsed Hoarder&#34; show is on the air.Hey, I want the rights for THAT brilliant idea."
B0098VVOGG There are no words. Episode 1. It will make you want to clean your house so hard! Episode 8 I actually watched 3 X because I wanted to share it with so many people and you just can't not watch it.... over and over and over.....one would think that the fact that someone has a puddle of dead cat juice in their fridge would be sign enough that they have some issues and they wouldn't need a television crew and a team of experts to clue them in, but equally sick is that I'M GLAD THEY DO!"
B0098VVOGG These episodes shed light into the complexities of the human psyche and how we all (one way or another) build protective walls around our own hearts. At times heartbreaking, at times aggravating, and always incredible to see these people react to their own actions and consequences. My heart goes out to them-I am a retired home health RN and have been in many homes very similar to those featured and have witnessed first-hand the denial, the &#34;numbing&#34; to the hoard's effects, and the &#34;mine at all costs&#34; mentality."
B0098VVOGG My husband and I watched this. Being in the health care profession we knew some information about hoarding. But this was a real shocker.  We consider ourselves collectors. He likes tools and I like craft stuff. Even though our collecting is contained to a shed and one small bed room we decided to clean up!  Goodness knows if we should die our kids would have to deal with all that STUFF!"
B0098VVOGG Love to watch.  Always want to get rid of things after watching.  Definitely something that keeps my interest and will watch again and again."
B0098VVOGG This show constantly makes you reevaluate your need for possessions.  Even after six seasons it is difficult to watch without getting angry with some people."
B0098VVOGG I am not a big fan of reality shows but Hoarders has been an exception in my viewing choices. My family called it &#34;Packrat Syndrome&#34; and didn't like to admit the tendency many of us had (and still have). I feel that I am in the process of helping myself avoid disaster by watching this show and trying to relate and learn. The professionals who come in to help these families and people who are afflicted are very informative and helpful - even in a show where the person cannot really improve much at all. I say this because the syndrome or illness does not get cured in one episode... you find out by the notations that some people get better and some don't. It shows how hard it is to deal with Hoarding at all - but dealing with it is a necessary tribulation for anything good to happen.I have learned a lot and changed some of my behaviors for the better as a result of watching this show. Thanks."
B0098VVOGG I have watched a lot of the hoarder shows because I had an aunt that was a hoarder but she died when I was young so I don't really remember much about her condition.  I tried watching the shows about people who hoard animals but it was so repulsive to see how these animals were treated when the owners thought they were loving the animals, but were in fact endangering their health by having so many.  I had to stop watching it.  This series is like the worst of the worst.  I just do NOT understand how people can live like this - I realize it's a disorder but I honestly could not sleep in a urine soaked mattress on the floor with roaches, spiders, rats and lizards crawling all over me at night because I couldn't bring myself to take out trash.  So please be warned that you must have a strong stomach to watch this show (in my opinion).  I've watched a few episodes from this season, but I've read some of the descriptions of the others and think to myself ... no, I've had enough.  Now, let me go clean my bathroom and organize my closets."
B0098VVOGG There is nothing more motivating than watching a few episodes of hoarders to get one in the mood to clean house!  Love this show always makes me feel like the place I am able to provide for my daughters is an absolute palace.  I  pity these people that they live years this way without family stepping in sooner."
B0098VVOGG If you are extremely bored this is the show for you. People like this should be sent to a mental institution"
B0099JKR6U Love watching without the hundreds of commercials that accompany the weekly show.Love the show and all the complex characters and plots."
B0099JKR6U look into the world of biker gangs. This show was a long time coming, and the scripts are influenced by real tales of the underworld. Fantastic cast and into the 6th year it's still a compelling show."
B0099JKR6U continues the Samcro saga into wonderful tragedy and violence all seemingly to keep the family safe and sound from harms way..."
B0099JKR6U In my humble opinion season 3 and 4 were a little lacking that old S.O.C. tude.  Well season four came back as hard as ever, only thing to make me as happy as this show at the top of it's kick ass game is to find out I'm right and that the Sons are a deep cover arms of the CIA"
B0099JKR6U Once again Kurt Sutter knocks it out of the park!!!  If you have never watched this and you think the shows not for you, well I get that and once thought the same thing.  It is and outstanding rendition of classic work."
B0099JKR6U I got hooked on this show through Amazon Prime and now I'm jonesing for the next season. I love the Hamlet-esque structure of the story as well as all of the tweaks and changes the writer has made to make it relevant to a bike club.This show is both high and low brow."
B0099JKR6U This is probably one of the best seasons of SOA.  Jax has a lot at stake, taking the helm of SAMCRO.  While he tries to steer the club out of drugs and guns, it appears that he's going to darker places than in past seasons and becoming someone he didn't want to be, namely Clay.  He has so many balls in the air, and he almost manages not to drop any.  Almost..."
B0099JKR6U A pretty true story of how gangsters operate.  The lead male is very good looking, and a great actor.  This is one of the best seasons yet, although all of them are good, this one is different."
B0099JKR6U There is nothing whatsoever sexy about a nearly sixty year old slut with a hotel blanket showing her wrinkley upper arms, shoulders, and neck. Sutter is overexposing Sagal and making her looks and behavior grotesque. An elderly whore is not an interesting character. Then she gets loaded and wrecks her car with her grandchildren in it. The strong matriarch has lost her throne and turned into a nauseating loser. That's not a character study, that is not character development, that is just plain character assassination."
B0099JKR6U I have watched the entire series and have found a strong story line, good acting from the main cast members.Season five is most violent because the group being involved with drug cartels . I am not sure that the storyjustifies so much violence but it may part of the message that everything gets tainted with violence once the risktaking behavior increasea to satisfy the demands of the situation that the group's leader finds himself in overtime."
B0099JKR6U Like all other SOA seasons there are some really cool car and motorcycle scenes along with some cool shoot outs, but this is the first season I'm not giving a 5 rating to. It's basically just wraps up the old theme that once you get into the life you can't get out but I guess I'm just getting tired of the SOA and watching them walk face first into the meat grinder for yet another season. In the end they leave it open, as TV shows always do, but I feel like the series is effectively over as of this season."
B0099JKR6U This is a great show and every season it gets better. Can not wait for Season 6 to start this Tuesday!"
B0099JKR6U We loved this season!  Now we are in for a long wait to follow Jax and the gang.  I like the relationship between Katie and Jimmy"
B0099JKR6U I have noticed that the bikes are not a priority, not enough attention is on them. MC revolve around the pride in the bikes and the road, it is sliding into just a gang that never works on their bikes nor take runs for the spirit of being on the road."
B0099JKR6U Started watching this show about a month ago after hearing so much about it and it definitely lives up to all the hype.  The cast and writing are nothing short of amazing.  This is probably the best tv show I've ever watched.  Can't wait for season 6!"
B0099JKR6U It's a good story ... People getting kill all the time the young pres....try's to make the club go straight .....time is against him and the forces that be.....I really like it..."
B0099JKR6U Sons of Anarchy is the BEST show on TV. I love watching it on Amazon prime instant video. I don't have to deal with a sattelite co. Plenty of BIKER ACTION. A MUST SEE."
B0099JKR6U Been a fan of this series for four seasons.. Understand the desire for writers to push the envelope however this time S5 episode 1 crossed the line. For me anyway. Afraid I am done with the series. Could have accomplished the same plot line and emotional impact without exposing the audience to such graphic and obscene footage. Too bad too because the story seemed to be headed in an interesting direction. Thank you Mr. SUTTER for four great seasonS. Going to return this and give JUSTIFIED a try."
B0099JKR6U Season 5 was probably the most intense season of SOA.  I really enjoyed it and wish the next season would hurry to get here."
B0099JKR6U Sons of Anarchy is a very good show. However season 2 & 3 had too much small talk. They would have a good action scene and then cut it short to go to a scene where Tara and Gemma would be talking about crap or to other people talking. They did that wayyyyy too much.But season 5 was written very well. Best ever!"
B0099JKR6U Each season is better than the last.  I love the fact that not all of the bad guys are bad and some of the good guys are the worst.  Eventually, karma catches up with them and some of the payback is oh so delicious.  This really is one of the best shows on TV."
B0099JKR6U Great writing and story line. Should have been nominated for Golden Globe both for dramatic series and acting. Too bad :-("
B0099JKR6U This show really rocks. I would love to meet Jax Teller on the road. I think he would make an awesome sidekick."
B0099JKR6U The true appeal of this TV series comes from philosophic questions posed be John Teller in his book/letter to his sons and then in Jackson Teller's own journal/letters to his sons concerning the &#34;big questions&#34; of life.  That's why I refer to the show as Philosophy on Harlies and other similar quip-tic phrasing."
B0099JKR6U I made the mistake of watching the series from beginning to season five in a fairly short period time. I was ill and decided that I needed to watch something serially. Seasons one through three were great. Season four started to get a little bit silly. Season five was so ridiculous that I just simply quit watching it even though I had already paid."
B0099JKR6U I was reluctant to watch this show but was convinced by my brother.  My initial reaction was intrigued but it took me a few episodes to connect with the characters.  Five seasons later this show still keeps me guessing.  It taps into a wide range of human emotion, adult content and a new context to the difference between right and wrong.  The creators/writers of this show are not afraid to upset you, so even when the show is a bit predictable they are able to shock you."
B0099JKR6U Season 5 has a lot of scenes and a better budget. The show suffers at this point from plot fatigue in my opinion, but I love the actors. Especially I like Katey Sagal - she brings out the best in the other actors."
B0099JKR6U This is so worth the small cost here on Amazon.. Am just amazed with the so well known Top Ranked Actors in this series..  Would recommend to anyone with a bit of wild side in them.. And the Irish touch they have added to it all.  Every segment of Sons just makes a person want to go right to the next.. BUY IT  Really Worth IT"
B0099JKR6U I was disappointed at missing the first showing of the episode.  Wasn't used to this new service; clicked on and was glad to get this chance to view it.  Reasonable price to be able to keep up with the series.  I'm glad this option is now available."
B0099JKR6U Man, I won't lie. I'm more than a bit shell-shocked over this episode. Sutter.....Sutter is a mad genius with a pen. I'm saddened over what went down in this episode but I admire Sutter's guts in doing it, knowing that fan reaction would be intense. Sutter has no sacred cows. He warned us before the start of the season that Sons was about Jax's voyage, and brother, this will affect the direction Jax takes from now on. Already he is harder. I'm sad but I can't turn away. I can't remember when a show has hooked me this hard. I didn't want to see what I saw in this episode, yet it stays within the familiar bounds of love and brotherhood that these Sons have for one another. Amazing. This is shaping up to be the best seasons of Sons yet"
B0099JKR6U This show is an intelligently written look into the lives of a motorcycle gang that is ruthless and would scare the daylights outta you were you ever to come across them in RL. Unlike other outlaw shows, this one provides a look at these individuals in a RL setting. How do you maintain you your status as a badass when you become arthritic and can't see without your reading glasses? What happens when you have a promising career as a surgeon, but end up married to a thug?"
B0099JKR6U Another outstanding season so far.  Can't wait to see where we go from here.  I like seeing seeing gemma with someone else,  especially someone like Jimmy Smit,  now lets get some revenge for Ope."
B0099JKR6U it is a very intense show that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time. I can't wait for season 6 to come out."
B0099JKR6U This very entertaining show is rather graphically violent; however, the acting and writing make it worth watching.  I can easily put my hand in front of my iPad when I know something graphic is about to happen, but a bigger screen will require a magazine (or the closing of eyes) for those like me who rather have certain things left to the imagination.To sum this show up, it is basically a soap opera based on a totally different subject matter that I don't believe has been explored on television before, so this is a very unique program.  Very educational, especially for folks like me who don't get out much."
B0099JKR6U I still like the Shakespearean drama component of SOA. But the &#34;action&#34; part is getting really tiresome (say about two seasons ago), it is turning into an adolescent's fantasy, and it is really getting hard to suspend disbelief, or take any part of the show seriously because of it. Look, we know nobody important is ever going to be killed, (even if chained and handcuffed, they will find some miraculous way out because TV villians have never heard of Occam's razor (or listened to the advice of Scott Evil), and even the CIA is helpless before the wisdom and power of Jax from Charming (having already easily conqured the ATF and DOJ, I suppose this is a logical progression...but what is next? The White House?). It has become a very lazy show, recycling years-old masturbatory character arcs and plot lines, and increasingly applying hard to accept fantastical resolutions. They went &#34;big&#34; several years ago and lost what was special about the show; the inherent drama in human relationships under extreme stress."
B0099JKR6U Started out rather darker than usual, but ended up surprsing and suspenseful. All in all one of the better seasons of Sons."
B0099JKR6U I first started watching this show via Netflix and didn't think I would like it. But I was greatly surprised. This show is gritty and real.I have actually become a fan and now that I'm caught up, I look forward to watching the current episodes. I highly recommend."
B0099JKR6U This show does not truly show the true side of all MC clubs however it is an mind grabbing show. I wait for the new season every year!"
B0099JKR6U Awesome freaking show!! I cannot wait for Season 6 to come on!!! Not only did they leave it in the air about Ron Perlman's character but Tara getting arrested???? Hmmmmm.......me thinks Gemma definitely had a hand in that."
B0099JKR6U I am not sorry I bought season 5 of the Sons of Anarchy I am disappointed with the show. I thought that by now it would be ending since where could it go. It seems that those in charge of it will drag out an ending that makes little sense.Instead of crazy independent this is the way we have to make through life the characters have sunk to the level of this is what we do for every thing. Will they learn how to be regular people or stay killers and thugs?"
B0099JKR6U great show! the mix of good and evil are just right served with a touch of back country justice and a bottle of tequlia and you got yourselves a meal you'll never regret eating!"
B0099JKR6U I have no beef with the quality or the price. However this season is not the happiest in the series. and if you don't want to see some of your favorite characters mistreated. You might not want to watch it."
B0099JKR6U I can barley remember the plot. Not one redeeming quality that I can remember. Giving the choice I would not recommend this to any one."
B0099JKR6U This season really takes you there as far as a fan's commitment to SOA.  All the characters are getting a peel.  Jax, Clay and especially Gemma have morphed into some creatures that at some point in this season are unrecognizable.  Chibs, Happy have always been down for whatever ride that has a spare seat.  Bobby and Juice, however, are seeing things through a completely different lense, it's about time.  This season gives you a lot of education on what is becoming of each character.  How life in the club isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  And I believe us fans knew that from the start.  It's just the characters are picking up on it.  And it's a wonderful experience watching it all unfold."
B0099JKR6U This was so worth it. Thanks for making this series available. I absolutely love it.... except to many people died. That was a bummer...."
B0099JKR6U Clearly defined characters with lots of adventure. Acting is great, story moves along. I deplore the violence, the language and the drug use. But I still watch.."
B0099JKR6U Most TV series begin to go downhill after about 3 years.  The story lines run out and the characters get old.  That is not true for SOA"
B0099JKR6U My son-in-law is a videophile and we rely on his recommendations.  We were hesitant to try this series, but he never let us down before.  WOW!  I have taught Shakespeare and literature and these characters are well-developed and intricately drawn; the dialogue resonates The Bard."
B0099JKR6U The season 5 is filled with drama .betrayals  and suspense. This great show is well worth the investment of time to view.A true TV classic."
B0099JKR6U one of the best shows out there right now once you watch it once you will be hooked and this season is by far one of there best"
B0099JKR6U This series started for me like Breaking Bad - had heard of it, but never watched it. I watched earlier seasons and was hooked. I had my wife watch an episode and she was hooked. In short, this series is about a motorcycle club and their &#34;adventures&#34;. It has a unique way of exploring who are really the good guys and who are the bad guys. Worth buying just to skip the commercials on TV. The picture is high quality HD and 5.1 sound is very good."
B0099JKR6U This wonderfully dark season has shown that the person, no matter how seemingly infallible, that holds the gavel can become a ruthless man.  The difference is that we're seeing this from one of the characters that we will root for no matter what.  Charlie Hunnan has portrayed Jax Teller in a stunning, provocative darkness.  We can only hope there is light at the end for our new President, Jax."
B0099JKR6U SOA is a show you can't quite believe you're enjoying.  Some beggars belief but still fascinates.  I can't wait until the next season!"
B0099JKR6U I didn't think I'd like this but after an episode or two I got hooked. The show has good characters, is well acted, and has more &#34;soul&#34; than you might think from the title. First it grew on me, then it grabbed me."
B0099JKR6U Characters are getting better.  Storyline is always better. The same people are  the best actors.  They draw you in and hypnotize you.  Love Kim Coates and Tommy Flanaghan.  Have watched their careers on different shows. They are emerging as the best of actors.  Can't wait every week till the show comes on.  One of my favorite shows on cable television."
B0099JKR6U After several weeks of episodes that were hard hitting and emotional, this episode was a breath of fresh air. Bravo to Sutter on the blackmail scenes. It had me rolling with laughter at Venus Van Dam, Tig, and the rest of the guys. I can't wait to see what happens with the police chief's wife and the guys who are breaking into the homes. But for now I will just have watch it again for the comedy!"
B0099JKR6U Was skeptical at first. I have now watched all to date from the beginning.Is great to watch but can the writers keep it up. One mistake and its old news."
B0099JKR6U Thus far this season hasn't disappointed; however, one of the twists was heartbreaking. SOA continues to engage me. Must continue watching."
B0099JKR6U this is a great series to watch. love that actors and actress in this series. keep you looking for more."
B0099JKR6U Very exciting show. Idealized motorcycle gang who has death and drama as their daily diet. Not realistic but very, very entertaining with excellent actors and more than decent writing. Somewhat violent but highly recommended. Addicting."
B0099JKR6U Better than last season,  SOA has recovered its violence and brutality that makes it interesting...wonder where it will go ."
B0099JKR6U I'm hooked, didn't think this series would interest me but when I saw that Charlie Hunnman was chosen to play Christian Grey, I decided to catch up on the previous season.  Looking forward to watching Season 6 now."
B0099JKR6U OMG!! This was an awesome start to Season 5!!!! A superb job by Kurt Sutter as always and I can't wait to see what the remainder of the season has in store. All the actors made their characters come to life in this episode and Tig explodes on the screen."
B0099JKR6U This series keeps getting betting every year. The changes in the plots keeps you waiting to find out what is going to happen next."
B0099JKR6U This is the best crime drama since the Sopranos. There is no way I will miss this show. Thankfully we have a DVR."
B0099JKR6U Jax has to realize that an areolae is like a finger print. He better hope the people he is selling this to never saw her's. Come to think of it, so is a thumb print."
B0099JKR6U Sons of Anarchy has been one of my top five favorites for the past five years.  After season four, I was a little worried about the show, but it came back and slammed it in season five.  Absolutely cannot wait for each weekly episode.  If you've never watched this, you are missing out!!"
B0099JKR6U Oh my gosh, This is going to be good that's all I can say. It seems the writers are doing a great job at getting things all twisted up right from go and I can't wait to see how all of this comes together. Great job guys...damn I  love this show."
B0099JKR6U Just when it looks like everything worked out the other shoe drops! I really can't wait for the forthcoming episodes..."
B0099JKR6U I liked the season, good bad guys, a few plot twists and it all came together in the end.  Some seasons leave you hanging, this one didn't, I can see where it's going next year and I will get the TV Pass for next year.On to Justified in January."
B0099JKR6U can't say much more than that. it does just keeps getting better, just when you think you have it figured out  another surprise"
B0099JKR6U A well-acted series, to be certain. Ron Perlman seems to be forcing his role somewhat, starting in Season 4 and running into Season 5, but the other actors are well embedded into their roles. A lot of action, and the dialog is realistic. However, the law enforcement types are not as &#34;nimble&#34; as they could be, allowing for the Sons of Anarchy to run rampant over local, state and federal laws, encouraged by a bunch of misfit Feds and more. The MCs themselves are portrayed rather realistically... there is a great deal of violence and gratuitous sex that truly does not further the storyline, going overboard. This does detract from t
B0099JKR6U This show is on fire! I'm so addicted to it. You never know which way the plot is going, it keeps your guessing until the very end, then it leaves you with a hanger...I cannot wait until season 6!!!!"
B0099JKR6U this is when you know tv is great! SOA awsome awsome it brings you in, like your there makes you hold your breath wanting more great show. So far one of my all time favorites. could not get better men or woman for this.bobby nice butt:)sorry call em like i see em.its a girl thing:) oh yea GO KATY GO!she will never more be peg bundy.HAPPY THANKSGIVING all please, please, tell me there's going to be a season 6 and hopefuly a number 7 so able can take over for jax :>)just thinking ahead. Omg that would be a mad awesome show."
B0099JKR6U This is a good show.  I wish they would get more into the friendship more and focus less on the guns and murders.  I also find it odd that a motor cycle club, just doesn't get out on the road for a ride to different places in the US."
B0099JKR6U A good portrait of true biker life. The show let you see  bikers as the real people they are. They bo bad things. But theyt are human ieth the same feelings for friendship & family that we all share. They have thier own loyalties & ethics.  If you are a friend to them, you'll find that they have your back when your normal friends would not."
B0099JKR6U This series is always solid though too violent most of the time.  The fact is, though, that portrayal is accurate for the lifestyle."
B0099JKR6U There is no  rational reason to like the people depicted in this show.  (Except Jimmy Smits) They are all criminals in one way or another, but still show some humanity at it's basest level.  It is looking like Clay will finally get what he deserves, or maybe not.  As for Jax, well he deserves his too."
B0099JKR6U This show is highly addicting.  It brings in all the elements of the outlaw life and an MC, sort of like the Hell's Angels.  Obviously a TV show, none the less it brings a bit of reality to the table and has a good cast."
B0099JKR6U I really like this series. Yah, I know...I find myself rooting for the bad bikers , but hey ..its television. Love the casting in this show. I find myself biting nails waiting for the next episode.  Highly recommend for all  of you rebels at heart, like myself!!"
B0099JKR6U This is the best show on TV for the last 5 seasons! This show has everything: sex, drugs, guns, drama, love, action...and new twists on each episode!"
B0099JKR6U What is better then getting season 5 less then a week before season 6 is going to start. This gives you just a few days to rewatch the season before the new one starts. I think they should release it at least 3 weeks before."
B0099JKR6U Great entertainment if you can handle the violence, nudity and language.  Not for young kids (imho), but it's a fun ride!"
B0099JKR6U Jax is President of SAMCRO and he has made Bobby VP. Opie would have been his obvious choice for VP but he is not active in the gang due to his conflict with Clay.Gemma wakes up with a Hispanic man, Nero, who she slept with and she is so hung over she doesn't even know where she is.  The sheriff is at Opie's house looking for Jax, Tig and Chib who are wanted for the murder of Veronica Pope.  Veronica is the daughter of Damon Pope who is the most feared and powerful drug lord in Oakland.Gemma has taken them to Nero Padilla's escort service headquarters where they are hiding and Jax doesn't trust Nero. They get a call that Tig needs help and Nero gives them the keys to a pickup truck so they can leave and not use their motorcycles. Jax and the guys go to Tig and find all of the bodies. Tig has gotten loose and killed a police officer, a gang member and a cleanup specialist.  They drag the bodies into a covered hole in the ground and pour fuel into the hole and burn the bodies. Meanwhile Tig is holding his dead daughter's (Dawn's) burned body who was killed by Pope in retaliation for Veronica's death.Jax and the gang are back at Nero's offices and they are meeting with their lawyer preparing to turn themselves in to the sheriff.  Jax is discussing legal issues with the lawyer and the existence of the RICO case against SAMCRO and asking her to take care of surrendering to the sheriff.  Jax knows he may be facing a long term jail sentence and he asks Tara to marry him now......Action, action, action! If you didn't think Sons of Anarchy could get more involved and have more exciting action then you were wrong.  This is a great episode and it sets up the major confrontation with Damon Pope and the SAMCRO gang.  There are also several sub plots going on in this episode and it is building the storyline for the season to really kick off.  The Sons of Anarchy is a great series and this episode is critical for you to watch so you understand the confrontations that will soon become a war!  I recommend this episode to you."
B0099JKR6U The Sons keep it coming at you, always that element of surprise. Love it, great writing, riviting performance, story line keep you at the edge wanting more 2 thumbs up!Crucifixed"
B0099JKR6U This show got many twists and turns. As well as there is more then one side to this show. I think the shows has great actors."
B0099JKR6U Can't wait for Season 6 just to see what happens next. I love the Sons of Anarchy Series and expect to continue watching as long as they keep them coming. Very Interesting cast of characters keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next surprise!"
B0099JKR6U This is probably the best show I have ever watched on TV.  It is exciting and I can't believe how the writers have made me feel sorry for the bikers even though they are into drugs, murder, and illegal activity.  Go figure"
B0099JKR6U the show is fast paced, no commercials, good characters. It is probably truer than we'd like to think that it  is."
B0099JKR6U This (5th) season has, several times, had me holding my breath or pausing an episode from the tension it builds! Wow! This is one of the few series that just gets better and better each year. My favorite (in this genre) series used to be Breaking Bad, but SOA has moved to position one."
B0099JKR6U What else can you say?  Very good acting, outstanding writing by Kurt Sutter, and twists and turns that keep you riveted!"
B0099JKR6U This was the best season ever and I am so glad husband and I started watching this series even though I kind of skipped the baby & Ireland stuff. Love my Prime!"
B0099JKR6U This season is awesome as all the seasons have been, I never really watched much live because of the schedules I work, but lets just say I love this show and hope many more seasons are to come, PLEASE!!!"
B0099JKR6U Love this series.  They are not afraid to do what needs to be done to move the story along.  It's raw, for sure, but that is part of its appeal. Great performances."
B0099JKR6U Love the series. Great cast. Great story line. Cannot wait for the next episode. Keep them coming S. O. A."
B0099JKR6U OMG - could this season have any more twists and turns... love-love-love this show.  You never know what will happen, who will die, and most of all how - easily best show on tv - hands up, down, handling a bike or weapon."
B0099JKR6U I cannot get enough of this show, each season just gets more and more crazy ! You are surprised each and  every episode,its really wild! My family and I love it !! Looking forward to Season 6 !"
B0099JKR6U This season went too far regarding the numbers of murders committed. I find it very unrealistic the SOA can openly kill dozens of folks and get away with it. It makes law enforcement out to be a total joke.Highlights of the season include Nero and the fact Juice, my favorite SOA, is still alive.Negatives: I am so tired of Gemma calling all the shots. Jax is supposedly bad a$$ number one, yet still has the umbilical cord attached. How he can even talk to mommy after all she has done makes him weak.Clay has also outlived his stay on the show. Though it was fun seeing him after having his president patch removed. What a sad little puppy.If you are ok with watching a show with plenty of senseless violence check it out."
B0099JKR6U The fifth season of \"Sons of Anarchy\" is amazing. It continues throwing new obstacles at the characters as they attempt to resolve their problems. There may have to be a bit of suspension of belief that things work as they do, but they do work. Jax has critical decisions to make, and is he turning into the step father he despises? Opie makes critical decisions about what he can do for the club. The results of this are shocking and help guide the continuing storyline. We see sympathy when Tig rescues a defeated fighter dog, and that sympathy follows us as Tig faces more challenges. We see the heartache of Tig watching a most horrific event sees a daughter murdered.Tara makes moves to solve her family problems only to see them become more complicated than before. This all leads to a suspenseful conclusion where the fates of Clay and Tara hang in the balance. This show continues leaving viewers on the edge. This is one of the most creatively constructed shows in history. Viewers should note that many scenes are violent. The heroes are criminal killers. Yet we see the humanity in these characters, and it makes viewers hope they find their way out of their dilemmas."
B0099JKR6U Season 4 was a washout. The only good thing was the set designers did actually manage to make it look a bit like Ireland which was impressive. Season 5 is back on track kind of but does pan out a little pat. It is very hard for them to keep this pace up for this long though, so well done to Sutter and his team.I predict Season Six will be the end and will conclude exactly like the Shield did.As an aside, The Shield is a better piece of work but then it's pretty hard to beat Walt Goggins when he's dialled in that much."
B0099JKR6U If you haven't watched this show yet, be sure to watch it from the beginning of season one so you will know what is going on.  Always unpredictable!"
B0099JKR6U I'm addicted. I'm not going to give away the plot or be a spoiler but I can't wait for this show every week. Go for it! I would have never thought I woud be the type to go for this show but I am!"
B0099JKR6U I love this series because the characters feel like real gangstas. If you have relatives, you might know one or more of these guys or gals."
B0099JKR6U The characters are so well developed ... they could be family :)  Well without all the killing :)  Hurry up and get Season 6!!!"
B0099JKR6U In order to make sense out of the on going plots I had to see season 1,2,3,4, Not for anyone under 18. Lot of fictional action. Little real world application. Just adult entertainment.Plot has thicken looking forward to how the club is going to proceed in season six."
B0099JKR6U This series has far exceeded my expectations. I have really enjoyed the acting & the writing. Seems like there is no such thing as a quiet day in Charming. Was sad to find out Charlie Hunnam will not be in &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey.&#34; I haven't read the books but was glad to see Hunnam get a chance to star in a major movie.'"
B0099JKR6U Considering all the violence, anger  and sex involved I, as a 76 year old woman, was so surprised at how quickly I got hooked by this show.  Waiting impatiently for next season to begin.  My children think it is a hoot that I like this show so much."
B0099JKR6U This show is getting better and better. Kurt Sutter is great. As is Ron Perlman and Charlie Hunnam and Katey Sagal. Love it!"
B0099JKR6U def keeps you interested!! there is so many good and bad things that happen that you just have to keep watching to make sure it all turns out ok!"
B0099JKR6U Huge fan. Always a great shopping experience when you use Amazon. Received it on time and in perfect condition. A little expensive though."
B0099JKR6U I'm so glad I have Amazon to come to when I have to miss my episodes of  SOA....would drive me nuts if I didn't :D. This show is WONDERFUL and very addictive. And Jax is HOT! :D"
B0099JKR6U This is one of the best seasons so far for one of the best shows on television. The twists and turns are great, the characters are still evolving and the plot never fail to keep you guessing."
B0099JKR6U I just started watching this series and season 5 was the best so far, the saddest but the best, looking forward to season 6 in September"
B0099JKR6U my husband absolutely loved this tv series.  he can not get enough of the characters, the story, and the plot."
B0099JKR6U I was tired of waiting for netflix to load season 4 & 5 of SOA so i bought the season on amazon.  If you havent tried watching this show yet...DO IT!  This among Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead are awesome shows."
B0099JKR6U I've been a fan of this show- right from the very beginning.  Love the drama and all the twists and turns.  Can't wait to find out what happens next!  The writers and actors are Amazing!"
B0099JKR6U This series just keeps getting better. The characters are so well drawn and acted that they grab you and drag you along with them on their adventures. And even the most despicable character is so human that you understand, if not agree with, their motivation for their action."
B0099JKR6U Quality of video is was very well! Some of the best acting on TV!  Hamlet on Harley's. Kurt Sutter is genius"
B0099JKR6U I think this season was better than past seasons and really setup the Jax as just another heartless leader and Gemma's ruthlessness continues. This season I thought was the darkest so far but definitely better than the last season and the Irish episodes or season 2."
B0099JKR6U This gritty and violent show is not for the faint of heart but the writing is superb and the acting underated."
B0099JKR6U This season is off to a great start, imo realism has increased quite a bit from last season.  I'll definitely be staying tuned in."
B0099JKR6U This is a series that give you an insight into the bikie world of hard crime but also the soft side"
B0099JKR6U I love Sons of Anarchy. I own seasons one through four and am watching season five on Amazon instant video because I do not have cable. SOA is so exciting and I feel close to the characters. Anyone who loves motorcycles and the bad boys that ride them will feel the same as me."
B0099JKR6U Season 5 of Sons of Anarchy was non-stop action all the way. While the show does focus a lot of the Outlaw Club, there are also lots of other people who come along. Jax finds himself a lamb in the lion's den and has to face down a lot of new enemies. You also have Clay looking for revenge and Gemma desperately trying to hold the family together. The show features a lot of realistic human interaction with people from all walks of life. I especially enjoyed Kim Coates in his role of Tig. There were so many great episodes this season, it's hard to pick a favorite. Its even harder to avoid spoilers, but one of the best shows of the season featured a dramatic death I never saw coming. Definitely a thrilling season and the Blu-ray gives you lots of bonus footage you won't see anywhere else. Its a great deal and the perfect way to enjoy every episode back to back."
B0099JKR6U this show is one of those shows you just have to see, break down buy it and experience what you have been missing"
B0099JKR6U I LOVE SONS OF ANARCHY. THE 5TH SEASON IS GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS PAST SEASOSNS. I WOULD STILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. THE VIDEO STORES DID'NT HAVE 5 OUT YET AND SOMEONE TOLD ME TO CHECK AMAZON. LOVE IT AS YOU CAN WATCH IT NOW, VERY RESONABLY PRICED. I WILL BE RENTING VIDEO ON DEMAND AGAIN.  THANK YOU AMAZON"
B0099JKR6U I LOVE this show, and the fact that I can have it on my iPad the next day is GREAT !!  Yeah, I know..... I do DVR it, but no commercials, plus the fact that, when I travel, it comes with me, makes having this on Amazon a plus.  BTW, I'm really enjoying Amazon Prime!  Having ALL of the seasons of \"Sons of Anarchy\" available is AWESOME (I purchased Season Four last year, and Prime has One through Three)!"
B0099JKR6U Good script, excellent acting, love the way the plot keeps moving.  This series employs excellent directors and cinematographers.  The reveal at the end of this episode is worth the wait.  I love it when I can't predict the direction a story is going to go."
B0099JKR6U My wife and I are amazed with the plot twists this season. Can't wait till next season. Should be a good one."
B0099JKR6U THIS SHOW IS SO WELL WRITTEN AND CAST, PLEASE PLEASE DON'T RUIN IT LIKE SOPRANO'S RUN, LET IT KEEP PLAYING SEASON AFTER SEASON MR SUTTER I KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING, AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS 10 OR SO,  SO LITTLE QUALITY WRITTEN AND ON TV THESE DAYS..HERE'S TO DON'T LET IT END!!!GREAT JOB CAST AND CREW AND CREATORS AND WRITERS ETC.."
B0099JKR6U Bought the season so we could catch up. My husband loves this series. You never know whats going to happen and it is fantastic."
B0099JKR6U Once you get past season 1 you are hooked!!! I am 66 and never would have imagined liking a series on bikers!!! I can't wait for season 7!!!"
B0099JKR6U This was one of the finest TV  shows I have ever seen.  However, just like just like \"Lost\" and many others, no matter how great the writer or creator,.. They completely run out of material ideas when it comes to an ending. This one one of the most disappointing ones I have ever seen. As far as I am concerned, I couldn't care less if it never comes back for another season.To have such a strong a story line, the ending  was crap.Of course, it did follow the way the world , as it really is today.  The worst slide by, the good are treated unjust and  so condemned, and the bad remain, left to wander the world.They are probably intending on another season, if so they will ruin it. After five seasons, the viewer is ready to see a slam ending and start getting excited about what is next.My ending would have been first and foremost, to see Clay have his baboon face blown off his head.  I have never seen a character become more of a pile of dung, as he did, and not get to see him totally annihilated.  Gemma  is a 50 year old whore, that needed to be put down, as well.  And I would have written in where Tara takes the boys and leaves for Providence and never look back, leaving  Jack with a choice, to follow, or to stay and live his life as a little boy, under his mommy's wing.Let's move on to bigger things, people, and try to putting a little more work in to planning a better conclusion.Four Star story with a one star 5th season.I am sorry I wasted my time and money on a season I really had held higher expectations."
B0099JKR6U never fails to surprise and gross out, to be inside Autos head what a trip, next season not soon enough"
B0099JKR6U SOA Rocks !! I look forward to seeing the show every week. Just want to say , Clay is a Scumbag , Rat Bastard !!"
B0099JKR6U A great binge watcher and one hell of a story. Emotion packed stories, powerful acting, worthy directing and plots that deserve your attention. You will always be left wanting more, and when you get it, you won't be disappointed. Why can't all dramas be this good?!!!!"
B0099JKR6U I keep watching this series looking for that one character with any kind of socially redeeming value to mankind and... five seasons into it... haven't come close. I guess when the series comes to an end, the entire crew will be lost in an atomic blast or something and not a single one will be missed."
B0099JKR6U The first two seasons I couldn't understand the fuss surrounding SOA.  By season 5 I wait now every week to be fed piece meal doses of that show.  Totally awesome.  The lead actor Jaxx is a hottie too."
B0099JKR6U I think I already left a review on this but maybe it didn't take. I'm collecting all of SOA dvds."
B0099JKR6U This is my favorite Series-we have them all and will continue to obtain them as they come out for a show that we will watch again and share with others."
B0099JKR6U Not usually my style of show but I became intrigued by the characters, story line and unpredictable plots.  Some episodes I definitely could not wait to watch and found myself up all night finishing it. Thank goodness,  I was able to watch all 5 Seasons in HD which was included in my Amazon Prime membership. Season 6 is not offered on Prime so Of course I had to purchase Season 6. The end of Season 5 left me wondering...."
B0099JKR6U Damn these writers. In my heart, I know that my rage towards Clay is irrational b/c hello, this is a TV SHOW. But I swear to Christ, if I see Ron Pearlman in the street I'm going to kick him in the nuts."
B0099JKR6U This is crazy.  In reading other reveiws, I see that you guys are not giving those of us who have a \"TV Pass\", a full episode to watch, instead many have viewed a version that is missing some scenes.  That sucks!  But at least they got to watch SOMETHING.  Now it says there is NO version available for me to watch at all!  I must agree with the others who are upset about this. I have a \"TV Pass\" for several shows currently.  If this isn't resolved soon, I may just pull all of them AND my \"Prime\" acct. Unacceptable Amazon!.....Here I am at 3:00 p.m., on THURSDAY and this  episode is STILL UNAVAILABLE!!,...Just about reached my limit in dealing with this issue...I spend a BUTTLOAD of money here, every week, on videos and T.V. shows, I want this fixed NOW!!..Or me and my money are done with you  inept fools"
B0099JKR6U The acting is excellent. The story is gripping. It's well shot. The soundtrack is fitting and great. The character development is intelligent, consistent, and believable. Each episode makes you want to watch the next episode. Even my wife, who initially did not want to watch this show, has gotten into it. She thought it was just white trash crap. She thought it was just manly stuff for her husband to watch. But then, after much coaxing, she gave it a chance. Now she's more engaged than I am! And I'm the Harley rider!I will make one note of caution: this show is probably not for young children (you decide what age that means - you know your kids better than I do). It's violent and explicit. There are things I would not want my 8 year old to see. I don't care about the sex stuff, but the violent images can be disturbing, even for an adult."
B0099JKR6U Great season, great show great cast. Watching this show is like taking addictive drugs. You cannot stop watching this show."
B0099JKR6U I've been reeling all week from the shock of the last episode. As when a real friend died not to long ago, I kept saying \"No! Say it isn't so!\" I couldn't believe it was really true. Then, as this episode opened, I saw Ryan Hurst's name in the credits and thought, hopefully, that maybe they'd pulled a fast one on us. But no, he came back one last time to play the body in the casket.It was good. The whole episode was great, but seeing his brothers put mementos into the coffin, personal stuff between them and their fallen friend, made me feel sadness and relief at the same time. It was something real people do, and at the same time it removed all doubt about the reality of his death, it also gave closure. My real friends and I had our picture taken with our friend in his casket. Morbid, maybe, but something we felt we needed to do. Again, as in real life, I can accept this now. He's really gone, and life goes on.Farewell, Opie Winston."
B0099JKR6U We have thorougly enjoyed this series. I plan to watch it until they have stopped running episodes. It downloads right away with no issues. Thanks Amazon! reat movie!"
B0099JKR6U Always a great show. Plenty of action and intrigue throughout.I look foward to each episode every week. Highly recommend it."
B0099JKR6U A good mix of thrills, spills, chills, sex, intrigue and violence. Characters are well defined and interesting in general.The story is kept exciting by adding a balanced mix of new protagonists and antagonists. None are all good or all evil. The actors are attractive, appealing and very good at their craft. Direction, editing a
B0099JKR6U This is truly America's most existential long-form series. I can't stop watching it, which underscores a kind of cultural mental illness I have contracted about applauding for nihilism and wrath as staples in my already jaundiced video diet (\"Justified,\" \"Breaking Bad,\" etc.). Here we have a story based loosely on Shakespeare's \"Hamlet,\"  re-imagined by Sam Pekinpah. The biker policy gang arc is that these boys will sell guns and lethal weapons, but do not want to soil their well-earned townie reputation by dabbling in the drug trade. Think about that for one second. Time's up. Now the Hamlet figure, Jax, wants to divest himself of this because his dead father appears as a \"ghost journal\" that Jax reads on the roof of his truck/auto/bike repair castle warning him that this gun business is the road to nowheresville. So Jax makes a ton of promises, all of which are broken. And in the wake of these broken promises, there's a body count second to none on TV, and the ones Jax truly loves--his wife and two kids--are betrayed over and over, promise after promise--I give you my word! Meantime, his stepfather, Clay, who is the Claudius figure, is so loathsome, that if promises were bullets we would be riddled right out of this story in one season. But he hangs on, defying every moral fiber in Jax's being and every thematic turn of logic. By the third season these guys are so knee deep in moral sewerage that it defies common sense that a fourth and fifth season could punctuate the circle of deceit devouring these promise keepers. But somehow they do it, and its entertaining, morally unfathomable as to why it's entertaining, but I guess that's what makes existentialism the emerging philosophy of America. Gone is our pragmatism; we now welcome the moral carnage of our own powerlessness to hope for anything better."
B0099JKR6U Never ever would I have dreamed a main character would be offed. I cried. Can't wait to see the retaliation Sutter has for us."
B0099JKR6U I was hoping that they would not go down the cheesey road with a new story line and wasso happy to see it didn't.  It just keeps getting better, WOW!"
B0099JKR6U he keeps up with this loves it and will continue to watch it as much as possible not a fav of mine"
B0099JKR6U Honestly, i could not stop watching this! It just kept getting more exciting. The characters are amazing. I stayed up all night watching this."
B0099JKR6U This season brought lots of chaos, death and change to the town of Charming.  The MC battles against drug cartells, as well as other rival MCs.  There is always a twist you didn't see coming, lots of killing and Mahem, not for the faint at heart.  I love it!"
B0099JKR6U Ok I must say I was blown away from the moment I started watching SOA. Every season draws you in more and more and season 5 did not disappoint.  I am huge fan of Charlie Hunman and think he is going to do big things in his career.  The writing on this show is totally from a different world than most Americans live in which contributes to the fascination of this show. Its grimy, gritty,  and has a under current of love and loyalty."
B0099JKR6U This season has been in many ways a different show. The darkness that has befallen on  all the characters is almost too much to take. The escalation of graphic violence is what has become most disturbing to me. First Tigg's daughter and now Opie?  Yes this is the underbelly of this gang life, although Sutter has driven it to almost cartoon absurdity proportions, but it seems the humanity of this show, along with the  great writing, is being lost in trying to achieve a warped narcissistic street cred this season. I feel it is a total cop out that first Piney goes out like he did and then his son goes out even worse? Come on Kurt where is the honor that SAMCRO once had? Maybe they never had it?Either way to see them sink to the level of gang bangers and psychopaths is disappointing.I know they already are sociopaths, but we love these characters man and to think Bobby Valentine is  the only  hope of redemption for the club at this  point.Now on a totally different subject if Clay escapes the same fate as Piney and Opey.... man there is no justice. The only levity of this episode was knowing that Clay probably ratted Neo out LMAOI am still  holding  out for this show to reach a pinnacle with its swan song but so far we ain't even close.Its becoming Kill Bill on steroids.More character development and less violence please.\" I Got This\" 12/6/2012The opening scene was the best of the episode IMHO great sequence and the music was perfect.Ok onto the review... I will begin that Freud and Oedipus would be  very pleased with this outcome. I guess I should have faced facts and seen the bloody mess on the wall that is the family Teller. Over all this ending was very  disappointing and an emotional vacuum, and we were livid about the BSG ending?Sutter missed a grand opportunity to  give Jacks a shred of happiness or release of even some of his pain but instead he allows him to surrender, or rather readily embrace the madness that has imprisoned him his entire life.Can anyone say mommy issues?After Opie was  gone he was toast.Plus how Opie went down was a freakin' disgrace.Yes  some  justice was finally served but it was undermined with the sickness of redundancy and the weakness of character of too many.No emotional reckoning  for anyone except Bobby Elvis and Tara and she is royally fraked.Maybe she can  hook up with Wendy in like 2036?I came to hate Jacks this season and really none of the characters in the end has a  ounce of humanity that was emotionally moving to me.Ok Bobby but he  hardly had any lines in this one.That pit bull they rescued this show had the most heart.Plus no music by White Buffalo this season?Another missed opportunity.So life lessons to consider after five years of this tribe?Be in the moment and act in love because  after your dead...you will be soon forgotten.\"Redwoods live Sons die\"\"C'est la vie\"SAMCRO"
B0099JKR6U Makes me want to date a biker!  Wow! They take that brotherhood and family to heart.  What one word could I use to describe this show Awesome!"
B0099JKR6U I very much like the intrigue of the characters and surprising events that take place it is both action packed and at times heart felt.  I patiently await each episode and recommend it to anyone who likes to ride but also enjoys a riveting story line."
B0099JKR6U This was one of the Best seasons of ANY program I have ever watched. If you have not seen it yet you just can't imagine how Super it was!!!"
B0099JKR6U Seriously, this show makes me want to put on all leather and keep a knife strapped to my leg. I highly recommend starting from the first season to understand the character/plot dynamics. The third season drags a little bit of the finale is TOTALLY worth it!"
B0099JKR6U these season premieres are often like the first chapter of a book and in this case this book ahould have thirteen chapters this year.Soveriegn is the first chapter of the fifth season of Sons of Anarchy leading in from the last chapter of Season 4. Kurt Sutter and company have, for the last four seasons, brought the story of Clay, Jemma, Jax and the rest of the motley crew of SOA and all their darkenss and have never dissappointed.This season, Sovereign is that first chapter and yes, it did start off with an incredible beginning. I highly reccomend that everyone watch SOA but if you don't know the show, you need to watch the whole show to understand what is going on. SOA is a journey, not a show that starts a story at 9pm and concludes the story at 10pm. It is a tapestry that is woven, every intricate, with it's dark yarn and thread. it is not for the feight of heart.As for this episode, what can I say? Dark, slightly twisted, turns take you into other turns not unlike a motorcyclist traveling at high speed through Southern Califonia canyon, not knowing what is around the next corner. Kim Coates is a standout this season. An often underappreciated actor, he showing he can hang with the best of them as Tig, clay's sargeant at arms. If he doesn't win an emmy for his performance this season, i want to know who does.I highly reccomend, not this episode, but the series for anyone that liked \"the Sopranoes\", for anyone who liked \"The Shield\" or for anyone that thought the first four seasons of \"The Wire\" were the best television ever did or had to offer. But just like the aforementioned tapestry, this show is a set of four books (so far) with thirteen chapters each and going to the middle will leave you lost and confused.Sons of Anarachy, as a show, is right now one of the best shows on TV. Soveriegn, is to me, a kick off for book 5 and closure to chapter 13 book 4. I suggest everyone catch up!"
B0099JKR6U Biker trash at it's finest. Although not a block buster in my humble opinion, a good watch when you are in the mood for trashy violent entertainment."
B0099JKR6U I laugh, I cry, I cover my eyes, I beg for things not to happen, I beg for things to happen. It's the entire range of human emotions. I avoided getting into this shows for years thinking it couldn't be for me, no way too terrible, but after watching Breaking Bad...I figure what else can TV do to me? Kurt Sutter that man is an evil genius, he's gonna do a lot to you if you watch from miles away, untouchable, untraceable a diabolical madman. The music is very in touch with the show, great actors-raw, gritty- some amazing eye candy, some sexy ugly. I love Tig for his freak factor 5,000. Jax for his smexy and jr tony soprano nod. Gemma's queen Bee is extraordinary, did her mom KNOW she was a bad seed and turn from her or did lack of a morher's love twist her this deeply dark? You gotta watch and see what I mean. When you watch your gonna have a love/hate with certain characters, the writing and the acting is just that good. I've said my peace."
B0099JKR6U Got this one because our DVR ate it and we can't miss our Jax fix.  All of these characters are so enthralling."
B0099JKR6U This is a very edgey brutally in your face series,so be prepared but it is one of the best on TV!"
B0099JKR6U I have been watching this series since it started and I havn't been disappointed yet.There are some aspects that creative license has been used to extremes of surrealism.Overall it is one of the best shows being produced right now though and that's entertainment."
B0099JKR6U It is hard not to be drawn into the lives of these sociopaths. The character development is good and the treachery is non-stop. It is very violent...I would NOT recommend for kids under 17 or so and I am not a prude."
B0099JKR6U this season of SOA has more twists and turns then the Pacific Coast Highway! Every episode is a cliff hanger in one way or another.This series is EPIC.Kurt Sutter must have had some close relations or some inside access to real MC's he seems to really understand the in's and outs of the MC world.I'm in an RC and we rub elbows with all of the 1%er Outlaw Clubs in our area so I've seen the real deal up close and personal.This is by far the best season of SOA."
B009AP2G26 I wasn't sure that I would like this series, but I am so happy that I gave it a try. Humor, music and heartfelt stories wrapped up into a terrific series."
B009AP2G26 I liked this season enough to watch it but don't LOVE it like I loved the first couple of seasons.  There are WAY too many characters to have a real story and there's just too much going on.  It's also super corny and too much &#34;Trying to teach a lesson&#34; and trying to be too politically correct.  Still love the songs tho."
B009AP2G26 I was a drama/band geek in high school and this show reminds me of the stuff we used to do.  It's fun to watch and the music is amazing.  Be sure to get their mp3's on iTunes.  This show is current, edgy, and innovative.  Glee addresses issues that other shows won't touch.  Well worth the watch."
B009AP2G26 I want my money back! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country. I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer, and how have I gotten re-paid? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DON'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch!!!! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers!!!"
B009AP2G26 Purchased for my daughter, who already owns the other 3 seasons. I started watching this show due to my daughter talking me into it. I really love and enjoy watching Glee. Season 4 is the last one where the character of Finn, played by the late Cory Monteith, will be in the show. He, and his character will be missed..but the show must go on and it has and I enjoy every episode I watch. I am not looking forward to the end of this show, which I have heard, will be only on for maybe 1 or 2 more seasons. Love season 4!"
B009AP2G26 I had been debating with myself whether I should keep watching GLEE this season because there didn't seem to be any continuity in the past three episodes.  They all seemed rather helter skelter.  Finally, we get to episode 4, \"Break-Ups\", and I now see this was the episode that determines where the rest of the season goes.  The couples needed to break up or take a break from each other in order to establish a new path for GLEE.  The old group is never going to be the same and that's alright.  The new path is now established and I am anxious to see where it takes the show from here on out.  I thought the musical numbers in this episode were also the best of the season.  They were full of emotions which made them sound very powerful and rich.  Let's hope there will be more episodes as great as this one as the season progresses."
B009AP2G26 This was a really sad episode. Season 4 got back to the heart of glee. What it was in season 1."
B009AP2G26 we still have the show in high school AND new york city. although i am enjoying the musical numbers in the high school, i am enjoying far more the adult story in new york. i am especially enjoying the story with kurt where he has gone into the fashion industry with sarah jessica parker instead of ahow biz like rachel. he means for this to be a temporary detour but he is very well suited for being in the fashion industry. at this point if they wanted to spin off a new show with kurt in the fashion industry, i would be following right along with the new show. having half a new cast in the high school version is jarring, they are still not melding very well. also, making sue sylvester into a nicer person may be a mistake.  i for one miss those funny segments where she was editorializing on tv with her utterly outrageous views. in short, this show needs to recover its equilibrium but it still does great musical performances,"
B009AP2G26 Glee has been going thru a difficult transition that seems to have culimated in episode Swan Song. This was the best episode so far this season. It was well balanced between the Glee Club and New York. The musicl numbers were outstanding. Still love Glee..."
B009AP2G26 I love Glee, but I gotta say that Season Four of Glee was by far the weakest of the seasons. The storylines were not that great-the songs not too good and while I enjoyed Blake Jenner, I do not like some of the other new characters. It also depresses me that this is the last season that Corey Monteith is in, and also that it was not that great. Don't waste your time or money on this, most of the songs can be watched on youtube."
B009AP2G26 This was another great season of Glee. It was much different in my perspective from the past seasons, but that does not mean you don't get great music, dancing and acting as you have gotten in previous seasons. I was wondering in this season how they were going to continue on after some of the main characters graduated, but the writers did a great job and kept the plot moving on, not in a forced way in any sense. The plot in this season was compelling and made me want to continue watching from episode to episode which is exactly what I was hoping for when I started watching. All-in-all, whether you are a die-hard GLEE fan or only a semi-watching viewer, this was a great DVD set for another great season and I would definitely encourage all to watch!*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*"
B009AP2G26 I love the music from this TV series. The only thing that hits it hard for me is that it is very controversial. It hits every controversial subject out there, and it feels like this year there is too much to take in at one time. They have the graduates come back as well as having all new people. The controversial issues in this series combined with the same ones as last year might be too much. What this series needs is closure so the watchers can move on. In this series so far they are becoming a little overwhelming with the issues and drama it sparks."
B009AP2G26 This season has its strengths and its weaknesses.  First, the female cast members have not defined themselves.  There is the Minnie Mouse look alike who is most irritating.  And the blonde child...who is evil like Sue and Santana BUT there is nothing to like about her...the element that made Sue and Santana characters defined and enjoyable to watch.  As for the males, the writers are trying too hard.  At least the leprechaun is gone...what a bad decision he was.  Blaine...please decide is he Howdy Doody's illegitimate son or sexy preppy...I would go with the sexy preppy. Now Finn...this guy has come into his own...perfect. The only male with energy on screen is the cross dresser...why isn't he there always...and he should have been Rizzo...period.  All said, I still like the show but I dread when a new episode arrives...because I do not know if it is gonna be a good show or bad.  Season 3 and 4 are fifty/fifty."
B009AP2G26 I have more energy to work out when listening to great upbeat music. But the &#34;plot&#34; is going downhill from it's previous low."
B009AP2G26 This is a great ensamble cast for teenagers so young.  The acting is fresh and the dramatic scenes are acted well and thoughtfully.  Great Sereis!!!"
B009AP2G26 Glee can do no wrong in my eyes... However as they begin to phase out the original cast of students it's hard to adjust to the new ones coming in, but I DO LOVE GLEE!!!"
B009AP2G26 Once again, glee was adorable. They are doing well this season with the dreaded high school to college transition for some of their characters. The music, of course, rocked."
B009AP2G26 I am a Gleek and proud of it! This show, from the begining has made me happy. Some of the song arrangements are iconic.The show has grown and continues to evolve around the group. I know it will end soon and I would love to see a video come out of some of the arrangements they have done. I just plain enjoy itt."
B009AP2G26 I realize they have to trade out characters as kids only get 4 years in high school. That said, it would be nice to get some &#34;new&#34; characters instead of younger versions of the original. Even the first episode of the season is called &#34;The New Rachel.&#34;  The repeat of shy girl, mean cheerleader, jock, outcast, gay guy, etc, is getting old. Where is the creativity? I watched every episode of previous seasons but found myself having a ho-hum attitude about these, often going weeks without bothering to watch. Unless their audience evolves as quickly as kids go through high-school, I anticipate this show will fizzle out after season 6, which Fox has confirmed renewal for.I do love the positive story lines, the way tough issues are addressed, and the generation of conversation that comes with the show. For that, I bumped it from 3 to 4 stars."
B009AP2G26 Thank you Thank you for having this available for viewing - being an internet only viewer, I was forced to wait 8 days until Amazon came along to make my week.  :)"
B009AP2G26 I love the music, the characters, the writing, and the cast. They are incredibly talented young actors, and the show continues to please!"
B009AP2G26 I did not enjoy the music in this one as much, it took them till about halfway through the season to get to the good music, and it definitely seemed scattered having everyone all over the place. Also, the preachiness came through a lot thicker in this season."
B009AP2G26 What started out as a reasonably enjoyable show seems to have run it's course.  Season 4 attempts to continue the story-line with some of the original 20-something- aged characters moving on to bigger and better things in the Big Apple.  Meanwhile, back at the old Alma Mater, everything continues to run on the same old track.  27 year-old Heather Morris continues her role as dumb blond Heather Pierce with a bit more screen time. Even the original music seems to be less enjoyable than it was in the first seasons."
B009AP2G26 Music. Where would life be with out music? Music can change dark into light. This is what this series does for me. It makes mesmile and dance. As the actors change, I do not feel the same about the characters. They are every bit as talented, and then Ithink it really is the music. That is what brings me back to this series again and again."
B009AP2G26 The production is outstanding and the talent is dripping from all participants. It is like watching Broadway shows from your arm chair.  I love the programs. Thanks"
B009AP2G26 I really enjoy this show  love the dancing movements and singing of course, they have some great talent in this show."
B009AP2G26 Its simply a great show, its fun, you know the somgs and its easy entertainment.  between Darren Criss' singing and just everything Jane Lynch, its worth watching."
B009AP2G26 seeing this brings me to tears watching cory's last season. its sad but it's still a great show to watch"
B009AP2G26 I love this show, I can't wait to catch up with Season 5.  The stories are of current high school kids, but lets face, it things were much different two or three decades ago.  High School is hard and transitioning to adulthood is HARD."
B009AP2G26 Every episode of this season makes me laugh and cry through every emotion!!!! I have never enjoyed a show as much as this one! The creators of Glee have saved my life!!!"
B009AP2G26 the story lines are getting pretty squishy, but as long as they keep singing with all the talentedkids and keep bringing back the oldies once in a while..I'll keep watching just to hear the songs!!"
B009AP2G26 I'm not even all the way through season 4 but it keeps getting better. I really love this series. There's some high points and some low points but all in all it's a great series."
B009AP2G26 The Glee series is one of the best series on TV these days. I love all the types of music that these do on the show."
B009AP2G26 The cast with the new additions (due to graduation) has a lack of chemistry that was evident in seasons 1-3.  The show is alright, but lack a stand-out personality."
B009AP2G26 Too many show tunes for me.. at least I think they are show tunes because I don't recognize most of the music."
B009AP2G26 ALways a guilty pleasure. Love the singing and dancing.  I do so enjoy feeling like an overly dramatic high- schooler once again. More Sue Sylvyester in small, salty doses- hehe - would be even better. Lea Michele continues to both annoy, yet fascinate me. The singing is BEWYOWOND: hey, all you pitchy dorks on reality shows- this is whaT real singing is. Ahem."
B009AP2G26 I love this show. The talent, the music, the fun! A show that hits on a lot of emotions....fun! I can watch these shows over & over again"
B009AP2G26 My granddaughter loves this show with all the music and dancing, I personally don't care for it, I think it hits the teen age better"
B009AP2G26 Glee is a wonderful show to appeal to all ages. What a treat to have music brought back into the home again, seemingly spontaneous and happy with great voices, backed by terrific bands and orchestra music! The plots are real, taking viewers back to the good and terrible days of school, presenting teachers and figureheads we loved or loved to hate. What a touching glimpse into the past, only better, because there we were, only with talent beyond measure and happiness at the end of the rainbow. Glee is definitely well worth watching at least once, if not more."
B009AP2G26 Have watched this show since it began and have always enjoyed it immensely. This year I am having a little trouble getting used to the shift in characters since many of my favorite characters graduated and there are new faces to be seen and new voices to be heard. I am glad that Rachel, Finn and Kurt are still on just about every week. I do enjoy the New York segments with Rachel and Kurt. And I will continue to watch and give the &#34;new kids&#34; a chance to really shine."
B009AP2G26 Really touches on all aspects of life in a very entertaining way, yet not crass, vulgar, or in an obscene way. The talents these young people have are showcased well while showing how rewarding and difficult living life can be. A wholesome family show."
B009AP2G26 Glee seems to be now overproduced to hide it's flaws. Somehow the momentum is gone. I am trying to care about the characters as I did with the original cast."
B009AP2G26 I am amazed at the way they mixed old talent with new, dealt with real issues and made me laugh.  Glee perks up my life and delights me.  It even inspired me to take voice lessons.  I used to be in a band and was a dancer, so I just love it!  What a funny cast!"
B009AP2G26 I love music and dancing and this show is full of it. I'm glad some of last season's characters touch base with their high school, but I could see leaving HS and following each of the characters we've grown to enjoy."
B009AP2G26 I have a love/hate relationship with this episode. I think it was done amazingly well and really pulled at the heartstrings, but it was so hard to watch so many of my favorite couples part. I absolutely loved the way they did the end song, but it made me bawl."
B009AP2G26 Another dumb comedy about teens and high school . Not funny and the music is awful and sounds like its from rejects from American Idol or The Voice ."
B009AP3HQK Better than a bad evening of TV.Richard Gere plays Richard Gere.The mega wealthy are different than the average man.Ruthless people being ruthless."
B009AP3HQK Arbitrage is a character study with a plot.  It was interesting to watch the downward spiral of Richard Geer's character.  Geer is excellent as is the rest of the cast.  The plot has twist and turns and holds your interest.  The end is....well, how will you feel about it?"
B009AP3HQK Great flick available here at the same time as in theaters.  My wife is a big Richard Gere fan and she really enjoyed the movie even though it's a subject she's not particularly interested in."
B009AP3HQK Aah, I thought I knew what was going to happen. I didn't. Not gonna tell. My jaw dropped once or twice. The writing is swift, sure, knowing. Played well. Highly innovative? Deeply creative? Waaal, mebbe not. But, like hearing familiar music played with gusto, sometimes it's better than an earnest creative effort. The scenes played seamlessly in to each other, dialogue worked from tension to reveal in swift, evocative steps. Nice work."
B009AP3HQK Not a fan of Gere but this story wasn't too bad. Had some good twists on what could have been a rehashed, tired storyline. The language was way over the top though."
B009AP3HQK Robert Miller is the hedge fund star with a very happy family, net worth in the billions and his face on the face of a very famous magazine. However Miller is planning to give it all up so that he can spend more time with his family.However this guy is not so nice, he leaves the house at night so that he can spend time with his french girlfriend Julie ( Laetitia Casta). on the other hand, he is neck deep into troubles stemming from an investment which went completely wrong. He owes creditors about half a billion dollars.One night, Miller and Julia get into an accident which kills her instantly. He manages to get help from the son of his former chauffeur to get away from the scene of the accident. The police instantly suspect him but cannot prove it. Miller is a bad guy yet you want him to win at all costs because at the heart of all his wrongdoings is a sincere need to help his family. Even though he get the drivers soon in trouble, we know that he has been good to them for many years.The cast is strong and Sarandon is great as the wife, initially I thought that she did not much to do but she delivers a strong comeback towards the end. Tim Roth was great in `Lie to Me' but could not fake the accent of a detective from NYC. Jimmy Grant as Nate Parker was the best thing about the film, a guy looking to make a fresh start but getting caught in the troubles of his past.  This is an enjoyable thriller with a great cast and surprising twists. Enjoyed it alot. 4 stars. 4/18/2013"
B009AP3HQK Very entertaining legal financial thriller with Richard Gere perfect as an unscrupulous, ethically challenged multimillionaire who on the eve of his sixtieth birthday sees his position as a great businessman and philanthropist turn increasingly precarious. His business empire was actually built on fraud committed to his investors, and the only solution he sees to avoid being caught for cooking the books is selling his company to a businessman that is playing hard to get. Even worse for him, her lover (Laetitia Casta) dies in a car accident while he was driving; he flees, but the police see him increasingly as a suspect for her murder, and a dogged detective (Tim Roth) will spare no stone in order to catch him. On the family side, his own daughter (Brit Marling) realizes he is a fraud; only his wife (Susan Sarandon) seems (alas, only seems) willing to stand by him. The film is fast and entertaining throughout. And for what is worth, on my own limited experience with businessmen, I think that Gere is impressive in showing the manic compulsive behavior of many of them. Fine film debut by director Andrew Jarecki."
B009AP3HQK Therefore, the movie ended well. I would not have wanted to consider a happy ending.  Not with all the wrongdoings that took place.  He was just at a point of exhale.  Richard Gere's character may have died from the injuries of the car accident.  All left to the imagination of the viewer, yet one clear thing is when money is not earned the fair way, there are consequences.  This movie was well-written, well-crafted, and right-on with today's world.  Great acting.  Great production.  Great directing."
B009AP3HQK The movie was ok with some intrigue but seemed to lose direction part way through.  Some of the secondary storylines could have been better developed.  Overall, it was evident why it was available to rent before it left the theaters."
B009AP3HQK This was a great movie to just sit back and watch with popcorn!!  It was engaging and Richard Gere is always a good actor in any role."
B009AP3HQK Every once in a while, a film would appear to you that everything seems/looks right while grabbing your attentionand you feel the pressure and anxiety that the protagonists are going through.This is such a film, very well written and directed by Nicholas Jarecki, a 25 year old newcomer and acted (leading by Richard Gere,Susan Sarandon, Tim Roth and several impressive new actors including Brit Marling and Nate Parker).Gere plays a NY hedge fund magnate with a picture-perfect family and all the perks that come with the money but in realityhe's struggling to keep his company and business afloat.When an unexpected tragedy struck, everything crumbled around him.An intelligent, gripping and even-handed drama with an appropriate and satisfying ending."
B009AP3HQK I watch CNBC all of the time - Rick Santelli is one of my favorites, as is Maria Bartiromo, who makes a cameo in this film - so it's somewhat odd that I had never heard the word \"arbitrage\" until I saw a preview for this film.  I believe that I saw someone say that using \"Arbitrage\" as a film title is a bad idea since so few people know its meaning.  Either way, the financial word has to do with taking advantage of small price differences across markets, but you can search for that yourself.What you won't have to search for:  all-around terrific acting in this really good movie.  There really isn't a weak actor here, especially Brit Marling, who once again gives a really good performance.  (I highly recommend \"Another Earth\" if you haven't already seen it.  Her understated performance there was probably very underrated, but not by me.)  Keep an eye on her; she will be a star if she isn't already.  Richard Gere is very good, as usual, as is Susan Sarandon, of course.  Even the guy who plays the detective is pitch-perfect.I believe that the title of this movie IS good, because no matter how far you peel back the layers, everyone's trying to get just a slightly better deal for him or herself.  Obviously intentional by the writer and director.  \"Everyone has a price, and you'd better be willing to pay it to keep playing,\" might be one of the themes.Now, not to \"dis\" on this movie but I liked the film \"Margin Call\" just a little better.  Zachary Quinto was really good there, probably as good as he was playing Spock in the new Star Trek film.  Some people might find \"Margin Call\" to be a bit boring, but I found it quite gripping.  But I'm splitting hairs a bit since you can't go wrong with either of these two films.To go along with the theme of the movie, you might be tempted to wait until the price of this film comes down a bit before watching.  I recommend against it.  Just pony up now for a pretty big recommendation by me."
B009AP3HQK This movie does not play out the way you would expect, but that does not seem to be enough to raise the bar for this movie.  It's interesting to she an example of how money does not buy happiness, pretty much the opposite."
B009AP3HQK DEFINED: In economics and finance, arbitrage ( /&#712;&#593;rb&#616;tr&#593;&#720;&#658;/) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices; ALSO, expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative).Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, one of the key financial movers and shakers with his own company.  However, he made one wrong move with a copper mine and now he has to sell his company so he will not end up broke and in prison (he misappropriated millions in order to cover the loss). Miller's life starts to fall apart while he is negotiating the sale, the chief catalyst being a car crash caused by his falling asleep at the wheel.  The crash kills his mistress and he sneaks away from the scene with some help. The police try to bring him to heel.What Gere portrays in this film is the very personification of arbitrage.  He is always in the market, always thinking, always leveraging and above all, dealing, dealing and then dealing some more. Although he seems to have feelings for his family and mistress, his mind never can rest on a person very long for it is always whirring, always shifting the parameters around until he finds a way out and forward.  This is both his incredible strength and his ultimate weakness. It is one heck of a performance and my favorite of his since AMERICAN GIGOLO.Other amazon reviewers have criticized the ending of the film.  I did not think it was flawed and I am going to say why but I need to put a spoiler warning in front of it as it does involve discussing the the film's ultimate resolution of this character.SPOILER........................SPOILER...................SPOILER......................SPOILER.....................SPOILER.............We end with Robert Miller (Gere) taking the microphone at a charity gala honoring him. He has just resolved some huge battles only to face another one on another front.  He has on the face he shows to the world and does not look at all intimidated. He is back in whirring mode.  His mind is going on what moves to make next.  He is used to being in tight spots.  He ENJOYS being in tight spots because they stimulate him to find a way out, to arbitrage once again. This is his entire life. He is ready for it; he is always ready for it. If he doesn't win, that is ok, as the battle is what he lives for each and every day. And, by the way, does anyone really think he doesn't have cash stashed in accounts abroad, as his wife suggests? Not me!  You can bet he has assets, caches and hiding places all over the world."
B009AP3HQK I have not been privy to the behind the scenes wheeling and dealing of the corporate world but I believe it is every bit as sleazy and slimy as depicted in this film.  Richard Gere really pulls it off and plays the ultimate sophisticated, cultured and impeccably coiffed slime-bag.  I have very conflicting feelings about this film; I hate it because I think it's about the world we live in today where it seems ethics and morals have no place in life when there's lots of money to be made.  The film is ultimately sad with few uplifting moments except for a few moments with Jimmy.  Jimmy is the only major character in the film who provides some weighty counterbalance on the evil scale because of his basic goodness, decentness and loyalty.  Roles were well played by all but major kudos to Richard Gere; the man can act."
B009AP3HQK I like Richard Gere this was a good movie not his greatest. It was a bit slow for me and I saw it twice, maybe I was distracted it just didn't stick with me."
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere gives a gripping performance as a hot shot business man who makes a few bad decisions that threaten his livelihood and his family's. His performance is Oscar-worthy, but the film's story along with several standout supporting roles really made the film memorable. It manages to combine relevant economical frustrations as well as personal tragedy and family drama into one cohesive and thrilling tale. This film really deserved more mainstream talk.Source: criticnic.com 19 January 2013Disclosure: Film sent by Lionsgate"
B009AP3HQK Gere does a fine job...story is somewhat predictable...but well done...n icely paced, well acted by everyone, and there is no justice in the end...satisfies our most cynical selves...."
B009AP3HQK The only thing worse than having to watch a movie you never really cared for to begin with is being forced to watch it again and then realizing you can't stand it. That's exactly what happened with first time director Nicholas Jarecki's \"Arbitrage.\" Starring Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, and Tim Roth, \"Arbitrage\" is the story of a billionaire named Robert Miller (Gere). Robert is the manager of a hedge fund empire that is supposedly one of the most profitable in the business, but Robert altered his books and committed fraud. Even though he's covered his tracks, the fraud is still there. On Robert's 60th birthday, a deal that will tie up all the loose ends and keep Robert and his family very happy and wealthy is on the verge of being negotiated. But that's when things begin to get a bit more complicated in Robert's life and his lies begin to get the best of him.\"Arbitrage\" was one of the first screeners sent out to critics during the awards season. The movie is getting a ton of buzz because of Richard Gere's performance, so it was thrown into the nearest movie playing device and watched as quickly as possible. Needless to say, it was a huge letdown and was passable at best. So many screeners are sent out to critics every year, but this was the first year that the majority of the pile was watched on this end. So after viewing 30 or 40 movies since its initial viewing, \"Arbitrage\" shows up on Blu-ray in the mail and since the specifics of the movie had become so blurred since the last viewing another one was in order. Its second viewing only makes the experience feel even more mundane.Robert Miller isn't exactly an upstanding citizen. Hell, he isn't even likeable. Robert Miller is only watching out for Robert Miller. He only does what benefits himself. He tries to make it seem like he's worried about his family, but he's honestly just obsessed with money and is afraid of tarnishing his reputation. Richard Gere's performance isn't bad, but it doesn't really deserve a ton of accolades either. He's a guy that's buried himself in his own grave who's now mimicking a cockroach who won't die while scurrying along and trying to find any escape route that he can. Gere mostly just seems to throw temper tantrums and has a few emotional outbursts, but is nothing speci
B009AP3HQK This movie is entertaining enough I suppose, but there's no redemption in the end.  Everything is about making deals, winning, money, and power.  Anything that gets in the way of this is just collateral damage. There isn't a single character in this movie who ends up redeeming themselves, or does the right thing, and the death of a young woman gets lost in all of this, and becomes inconsequential, and nearly forgotten.  She was just another bump in the road, another transgression to be swept under the rug.  Life goes on just as before...  I suspect this movie gives us a good glimpse into the world of the American elite, their way of thinking, and the kinds of things that take place every day in their distorted worlds."
B009AP3HQK Anything with Richard Gere is usually pretty good, he's such an awesome actor.  You weren't sure how this was going to end, it definitely keeps your interest."
B009AP3HQK But the writing and plot is a little weak.  Susan Sarandan is completely underutilized.  Just a ho-hum movie at best."
B009AP3HQK I really like Richard Gere but I think that this movies is quite below his ability. The movement and themes of this film have been used time and time again so that the viewer knows what will happen which leads to a boring repetitive theme seen in so many other movies. Originality is missing in today's hollywood productions. ,"
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere has proven what a good acter he is. This is a well written story of power and money. I missed it in the theater and happy I remembered I wanted 2 C it. Great film !"
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere as usual was great. I enjoyed the tension of the story line and the acting. A puzzler not action film."
B009AP3HQK Shades of Bernie Madoff, though this time the culprit gets away with it.  If anywhere near the truth it comfirms my deepest fears about our financial system and the ability of the wealthly to \"circumvent\" the system, hide their misdeeds (leaving the little guys to pay the bill).  Well acted and interesting enough to keep my limited attention span in place, kudos to \"Ellen\" for her twist at the end, at least someone benefitted from this scam!!"
B009AP3HQK \"Arbitrage\" has enough tension and intrigue to carry you through even its rather draggy middle portions. It's a pretty decent corporate thriller that convincingly shows the inner workings of a big New York investment firm. It has its share of surprises and skillfully makes use of subtle details (ex: the license plate photos). Nevertheless, it lacks the climactic punch it seems to promise. When the credits started rolling, I thought \"Huh? That's IT?!\"It's not Gere's finest performance: his character's a bit wooden at times. Still, though I don't generally like billionaire CEO types who cheat on their wives, the storyline and script made me care what happened to him even though a big part of me didn't particularly want to care. Some really fine acting by most of the supporting cast, particularly Susan Sarandon and the various guys who play Miller (Gere)'s corporate cronies and rivals."
B009AP3HQK It seems quite a letdown that Richard Gere's impressive performance in this handsomely mounted 2012 thriller has been relegated to On Demand, but the same fate befell 2011'sMargin Call, another effectively Machiavellian Wall Street-set thriller, probably because the mechanics of cutting big financial deals just doesn't feel all that cinematic despite being terrific showcases for able actors. With his trademark &eacute;lan in check, he plays Robert Miller, a billionaire Wall Street investment executive whose silken imperturbable manner can charm and kill at the same time. Miller's company is in the middle of a federal audit as he tries to sell it. The problem is that he has illegally borrowed more than $400 million, well beyond the true value of the company. The lender threatens to take his money back, but Miller stops at nothing to keep the fraud under wraps, his family and the IRS in the dark, and his firm functioning more or less as usual.Miller is simply unflappable no matter what the circumstance is, whether it's negotiating an unethical high financial deal, attending his 60th-birthday party, or spending a few tempestuous hours with his mistress, a French art gallery owner whose neediness makes Miller vulnerable to a moment of truth he cannot control. An unexpected event literally leaves blood on his hands, and a web of deception drops him further into an abyss. Instead of seeking absolution, Miller moves from chilly manipulation to unrepentant criminality. The evolution feels seamless because Miller never sees anything wrong with what he does, and first-time director Nicholas Jarecki does quite a capable job of maintaining the pace and momentum of an internally driven thriller that allows the main character to unravel in a series of dialogue-heavy scenes courtesy of Jarecki's insightful screenplay, an excellent sophomore effort (his first was co-writing 2008'sThe Informerswith Bret Easton Ellis).Although he was a last-minute replacement for Al Pacino (who would have brought an earthier dimension to the role), Gere is smartly cast here because his screen persona has often provided a glacial veneer over a seething core of anger and resentment. Playing Miller allows him to do just that in a most arresting manner that makes him both morally repellent but oddly sympathetic. As the detective intent on getting Miller convicted, Tim Roth is quite effective down to the Columbo-like inquisitiveness and Jersey Shore accent. Nate Parker brings unexpected depth as the moral center of the story, a Harlem kid whom Miller previously helped out of a jam but who now faces much bigger consequences returning the favor. Indie breakout Brit Marling (Another Earth) affectingly plays Miller's sharply analytical daughter, the chief accountant of his firm who slowly realizes her father's true nature. Susan Sarandon has relatively few scenes as Miller's insulated wife Ellen, but her steely intelligence comes through in the climax. It's worth seeking out."
B009AP3HQK I didn't have high hopes for this film initially because I had not heard of it and it had 2 well known actors in it. I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was good as expected, but the story was compelling as well. The only thing that kept me from giving it the 5th star is the abrupt ending. I was so wrapped up in the story I was expecting and wanting more.David DonnellyColorado"
B009AP3HQK good solid movie that kept me engaged and love me some richard gere. Glad I watched it and spent the time."
B009AP3HQK It's about people living lies in order to succeed, even though it does not bring them happiness.  There are better ways to live, and I'd rather learn about those."
B009AP3HQK Typically, I love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. I had high hopes and sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me. I felt the plot was a bit weak and obvious / dull / been done enough already... The supporting actors were just so so. I wish SS had a larger role, I don't enjoy Tim Roth or Monica Raymund, so was disappointed to find they were part of the cast. Thankfully MR didn't have a large part. I watched while doing some hemming, so at least my time wasn't wasted."
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, who on his 60th birthday, appears to be the portrait of success in American business, and the perfect husband and father. However, what he portrays on the outside is only a cover-up for the dark secrets he holds on the inside. His mansion was a dream come true, but behind the walls are silent echoes that he's in over his head. In desperation, he attempts to sell his trading empire to a big bank, before fraud is revealed. During this process of panic, he struggles to hide his secret from his wife, Susan Sarandan, and his daughter. To add on more stress, he is having an affair with Julie. Just before he unloads his troubled empire, an unexpected bloody event takes place, forcing him to juggle crime with family and business as someone from his past comes back to haunt. The NYPD begins to confirm suspicions, and trouble ignites until it explodes. Michael Bryer goes after Miller full-force. Will Miller clean up his act, or run and hide? This is a fast-paced drama that relates to economic problems, white-collar workers, Wall Street, and crime. The tone is tense, but Performance and Dialogue are lacking. The movie moves too fast as it becomes confusing and disappointing. The ending does not satisfy. Worth seeing? Yes. But, don't expect too much. Richard Gere has done much better in several other movies!"
B009AP3HQK Really enjoyed this movie. It was engrossing. Richard Gere carries it though all the acting is good. Ending is very good."
B009AP3HQK Money is the root of all evil. Nicholas Jarecki wrote and directed this unrelentingly dark film about the etiology of our current financial lethal disease state and in doing so helps bring to light some of the aspects we need to examine instead of simply shudder and ignore. To have the courage to write such a controversial story (the nidus of which is exceedingly similar to the Bernie Madoff travesty) sets the tone for this film - a film that dares to explore the manner in which a wealthy businessman descends into his own hell and yet manages to survive. It is a disturbing theme: it is a brilliantly acted and directed film.Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is a multibillionaire hedge fund magnate whose errors in investing judgment are catching up with him. He is the patriarch of a family that consists of his supportive and adoring wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon, as beautiful and brilliant as ever), a son who is so unimportant that we never get to know him, and a beautiful bright daughter Brooke (Brit Marling, an actress to watch closely) who is Miller's sidekick in his trading empire. Miller's flaws show from the beginning: he has an artist mistress Julie (Laetitia Casta) with whom he secretly cavorts, an investment in Russian copper on which he spends his clients' money to acquire before the investment falls through, he owes money to an angry loaner who pressures him to pay off his huge debt, etc.  Troubles are compounded when Miller suggests to Julie they take her car and go to a seaside summer home to get away and during that trip Miller accidentally wrecks the car and Julie is killed.  Miller calls Jimmy (Nate Parker, another brilliant characterization), the son of a man Miller befriended in the past, to pick him up. And there the trouble begins.  A persistent but crooked detective (Tim Roth, superb!) causes problems as he investigates the death of Julie and from there Miler must try to put together the broken pieces of his life by selling his company (whose worth is questionable) to escape both his imprisonment for fraud and Jimmy's imprisonment for obstruction of justice.  How all this weaves together with his wife and his daughter is left in a manner that makes the audience wonder what will happen next - should the story proceed.Richard Gere gives probably the finest performance of his career: he has too frequently been overlooked for his memorable roles in movies. Likewise Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, Nate Parker, and Tim Roth create characters we will never forget.  The supporting cast is populated with the likes of Graydon Carter (yes, of Vanity Fair fame), Stuart Margolin, Felix Solis, Reg E. Cathey, Curtiss Cook, Bruce Altman and many more. The music that highlights moments in the film is from such disparate singers as Billie Holliday and Bjork whose  `I See Who You Are' serves as an apropos closure during the film's final credits. It may be tough to witness the way the corporate world works, but few films have done a better job at pulling back the curtains to let us view those things we'd rather not acknowledge.  Grady Harp, September 12"
B009AP3HQK I found the movie very entertaining and engaging. You're watching the story play out and routing all the time for a guy trying to get away with manslaughter and fraud!  But beyond this, it lets you feel like you gain some insight into the way big money in the business world works - or could work - or at least probably has worked before.  I didn't mind the movie's seeming ending in mid-sentence.  Perhaps all that needed to be said had been said.  The movie chose its path and followed it to an acceptable conclusion both for the characters and for the viewer who is left with something to think about.  It was kind of a \"happy ending\", kind of an \"unfinished ending\" - but is there ever a finish to any story?  Some reviewers mention wanting to see him get nailed, but in a way, he is - by his wife.  The \"punishment\" he receives from her however is probably much more productive and beneficial to society than just having him spend time in jail.  While the movie was high-budget, high-gloss modern film-making, it ended like a noir or something out of the New Hollywood era of films made in the early 70s which often cut-off mid-sentence and made no apologies about it.  None needed here either really. In ending where it does, it doesn't try and force things - and it makes its point without having to.  What we're left with is a man about to donate a great amount of money to charity.. and for those that know nothing of the man's real story, he will go down in history as a great humanitarian."
B009AP3HQK I could only stand to watch this movie about 15 minutes.  I came close to watching a major league baseball game as an alternative, and that's a sad statement.  no really worth even 1-star."
B009AP3HQK Something misled me into expecting a smart white collar crime story, say like Margin Call with Spacey, Irons a.o.This one isn't it. Nothing wrong with the cast, Gere and Sarandon a.o. do their job, but the plot is, frankly, just yellow press pulp.American billionaire in his 60s runs into headwind on two fronts at once. His risky investment in Russia faces obstacles, which he tries to hide by cooking the books, so that he can sell his company just in time. His private life is upset by an accident: driving at night, he falls asleep, and his girl friend dies. He tries to hide his involvement from the police, and that becomes a race of time in the course of his company sale. His wife knows about it all, as wives do, and blackmails him. His daughter, who works with him, finds out about his con games and threatens him... That seems to be all the pressure a man needs in life.That should make a good suspense possible, if not a very original case, but the movie fails to interest me. I also see a serious flaw in the plot line: how can the man, Gere's billionaire, expect to sell the company and not be caught afterwards for the faked numbers?"
B009AP3HQK I enjoyed the movie. Would have liked a different ending but then again it would have changed the effect I think they were looking for with approaching it the way they did. The sad truth is that there are many folks who get away with murder and a whole lot more and it is simply because they buy their way out of the situation.  Which is how this man seemed to solve everything."
B009AP3HQK Very good movie and I might even watch it again. Richard owned his character, as did Sarandon. Loyalty verses deceit..no real winners."
B009AP3HQK Had not heard of this film, but turned out to a pretty good film. Don't know that I would have paid money to see it."
B009AP3HQK I like Richard Gere and usually watch whatever movie he is in.  This was a great story about one lie leading to millions more.  It wasgood watching."
B009AP3HQK Robert Miller's (Richard Gere) life is falling apart around him and nothing seems to be going his way. He plots an elaborate scheme to defraud a bank who is a potential buyer of his business out of hundreds of millions of dollars to save his reputation and money. He truly believes the world revolves around five things, M.O.N.E.Y.. A bad investment has cost him, his partners and shareholders their investments and now he wants to save face and still be seen as a brilliant hedge-fund manager.A series of mistakes can cost him his family, his freedom and his money in a matter of days and the elaborate plot unfolds. Can he manipulate the system to save all that he holds dear or will he face the consequences of all of his actions......This is a well written thriller that features multiple actors in the cast that are among the top of their field. It is a very good story about how a man with money can manipulate the system to overcome his serious character flaws and criminal acts. My wife and I enjoyed the movie and we rated it as a 4 star film. I felt that it was well written and acted but at times it dragged and moved very slowly."
B009AP3HQK I had high hopes for this movie based on some of the other reviews and the fact that I like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately, there were few redeeming qualities about this movie and their acting wasn't among them.The storyline fell flat, the acting was shallow, and Richard Gere's character was a total A-hole. Didn't care what happened to him at all. And it turns out that his wife, played by Susan Sarandon, was just as bad. She really didn't care what he did or how he did it as long as he didn't bring his problems \"to their doorstep\" or get their daughter in trouble (the daughter was the firm's CFO).The entire film felt like a made for TV movie, not a national theater release. Actually, it felt like a Lifetime channel made for TV movie!The only redeeming character was the young man who begrudgingly helped Gere's character. He was the only one who had a heart and deserved leniency. He and maybe Gere's daughter.The kicker for me though, was that the movie was so poorly done that they put Susan Sarandon in a cheap prom-like gown to go to a charity ball. Now, keep in mind that Sarandon and Gere's characters are multi-millionaires in their mid-50s. So why in the world would she be in an ill-fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown?Why do I care about the dress? Because it just highlighted the fact that the writers and directors did not pay attention to small details that would have made this film more believable and more worth watching. As it is, Arbitrage was a thrill-less drama with a stupid ending that should have left me wondering what would happen to Gere's character. Instead, I was left wondering why in the world I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous movie."
B009AP3HQK There are so many strands of story lines, and to be perfectly honest - I haven't the faintest if they ever connected.  The worst part is that I got to the end and I didn't even care anymore. Hedge funds, missing assets, lovers, accident, dead lover, penguins, photoshop...okay, okay...there weren't any penguins...I don't think.  Gere and Sarandon are always good.  They could do an episode of 'Keeping up With the Kardashians' and it would be good...I may even watch 'Honey Boo Boo' if they showed up on there, but the rest?  I couldn't even tell you who they were now and it's been less than 10 minutes.  Okay...I lie a bit, but seriously...my official statement about 'Arbitrage' is meh.  What is arbitrage anyway? And do I care?"
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere wasn't up to his usual sparkling acting in this. Maybe it was just that the character he portrayed was a bit tired, but I felt it was deeper than that - Gere himself seemed to be pushing himself in this."
B009AP3HQK Not sure what to expect from this movie, I was not overly excited from the description of this movie, but I did find that this was a decent enough dramatic thriller that makes you wonder how things will end.  Although the story is not terribly original and seems to borrow from the pages of the news it does a decent enough job to give you an entertaining story.  The acting is solid and the story entertaining, although it has some plot holes for sure.  Its worthy of a rent, but not sure it would bring you back over and over to watch again and again."
B009AP3HQK We did not think this was Gere's career-high.  Sarandon, usually wonderful, didn't have enough to do and appeared to phone this in. Big waste of money - don't fall for the great reviews."
B009AP3HQK This movie is not just about wealth and greed.  It is about moral bankruptcy.  And, by the end of the film, we learn that moral bankruptcy can have many faces.  There are those who are directly complicit in egregious conduct -- and there are those who simply enjoy the largesse and ignore the consequences.  Of course, moral bankruptcy never ends \"simply.\"  So, I really hope that there will be a sequel.  Stellar performances by stars -- both old and new.  See it and decide for yourself."
B009AP3HQK This is a movie that mixes it up so there's a little bit of everything in the characters.  Robert Miller does bad things but he's not a bad guy.  His wife is nearly a saint, but she knows how to get what she wants.  His girlfriend is mad for him but she also uses him for her artistic ambitions.  When Miller gets trapped in a crooked \"arbitrage\" and a car crash that could both end his career and send him to prison, he tries to save his friends, family, employees, and himself.  You could call him a machiavellian with a heart.  This is a movie that keeps you on the edge and has a pretty satisfying ending."
B009AP3HQK This movie was very entertaining. I really enjoyed Richard Gere's performance. I also thought the story was well written and the plot was good."
B009AP3HQK Intended as an indictment of the one-percenters, but falling completely flat due to a lifeless script that has been done more times than Pamela Anderson has been mounted.Always affable Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, investment fund guru and billionaire. A power player on The Street with the grandiose nickname of 'The Oracle', given in response to his ability to forecast trends and seeing opportunities that the average manager did not. A man who is respected by his peers, adored by his investors, and loved by his family. He has it all. And as we get past the glossy introduction scenes, the dark and ugly revelations are quick and decidedly unremarkable.Unsurprisingly, Bob is a lying philanderer abusing the love of a good wife; a corrupt businessman who has manipulated and leveraged his company's assets into a wholly illegal and monstrously devastating position. And a self-absorbed narcissist who, when pushed, reveals his twisted inner essence. In a nutshell - evil dressed in a power suit and handsome frame.Yes, we get it. The one-percenters are moral frauds and ethical failures.Not a particular fresh revelation.And based on the brief revolting experiences I had scoping out various published society pages of Gotham, Malibu, Bean Town and the Potomac palaces - almost certainly an accurate portrait of most of the upper echelon and their stunning disconnect from us, the remaining 99%. Only $2 million dollars indeed.But an entire film restating the obvious isn't particularly creative or enjoyable.A production made worse with the stunningly linear role of the oh-so-tragic figure of Mrs. Ellen Miller, played by Susan Sarandon. Ah yes, she of the steadfast homefront, withstanding her partner's past indiscretions, supporting his weakness - loving the man for all his foibles and shortcomings until finally discovering who she had really married. And in a final&eacute; worthy of a Lifetime Channel flick - a karmic resetting of the scales by delivering societal goodness under a false banner of generosity. Cut to the award scene where she delivers slow perfunctory claps from a sitting position while everyone else is standing and cheering in admiration.Depressingly predictable.The sole presence that I found even mildly engaging was Stuart Margolin as Miller's personal attorney. I have very fond memories of the character actor as the persecuted neurotic goof from a multitude of comedies during the 70's and 80's. Screening him some forty years later as a calculating thousand-dollar-an-hour legal eagle was surprisingly enjoyable. But noting his wonderful performance was like noting a sweet cherry on top of a bored moose's steaming dung pile.I would love to say that there was something here worth spending entertainment funds or precious time out of one's life - but after thirty or so minutes I started to press the FF every few frames; skipping over ground that, quite frankly, started to put me to sleep. Literally.Destined for the OWN Channel's rotation.Movie Note:- In all honesty, to get a better sense of these people and their lives, I would strongly suggest watching \"Margin Call\" from 2011."
B009AP3HQK Lies, deception, all in the interest of leveraging another deal...amazing illustration of what occurs in cutthroat business deals in many places every day. Gripping!"
B009AP3HQK Nobody plays this type of roll which was well written and acted better than Richard Gere. He still has it."
B009AP3HQK I loved it!!!  Superb acting along with a great movie.  I recommend it to all Richard Gere Fans as well as fans of thriller movies."
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere was at his best in a movie about what money does to a person and how greedy they can become, putting their family and friends' lives in jeopardy for the sole purpose of self-advancement."
B009AP3HQK Good Movie. Has some drama and situations you wonder how he will get out of. Very interesting and a good cast, too."
B009AP3HQK ARBITRAGE is one of those movies that aspires to be more than it really is.  Despite its attempt to be a moral tale of contemporary business ethics, it's basically a story of a cheating husband having an affair that results in a tragic occurrence.  It essentially serves to show the power of wealth and the shallowness of the rich and powerful.  None of its leading characters are likeable or sympathetic, down to the self-serving detective.Richard Gere, a Golden Globe nominee, is excellent as Robert Miller, a deceptive corporate bigwig who'll do anything to maintain his excessive lifestyle.  Nate Parker gives strong support as Gere's helpful friend.  The rest of the cast doesn't fare as well:  Susan Sarandon is a caricature of every Lana Turner or Joan Crawford movie ever made.  As the corrupt detective, Tim Roth sleepwalks through the role.  Brit Marling as the betrayed daughter isn't given a lot of depth to truly involve the viewer.The film itself is slow-paced and never achieves a good momentum.Three stars for Gere's commanding effort."
B009AP3HQK Like 2011's \"Margin Call\", \"Arbitrage\" is a film that exploits the public's fascination with the world of high finance following the global economic crisis. Both films were written and directed by sons of Wall Street traders, who grew up in that environment. Unlike \"Margin Call\", \"Arbitrage\" does not attempt to say much about the financial world, much less the financial crisis. Instead, \"Arbitrage\" is a character study of a hedge fund manager whose world comes crashing down in the wake of bad decisions and bad luck. Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is a self-made magnate, owner of Miller Capitol, who finds himself in need of a lot of cash after an investment in a Russian copper mine is tied up by regulatory laws and foreign bureaucracy. He needs to sell his company to Standard Bank & Trust, and he has borrowed $412 million to plug the holes in his books until the sale. In the meantime, tragedy strikes when his mistress is killed in an accident that could derail the whole deal.Robert Miller is a relatively common name, but it happens to be the name of a real billionaire who made his fortune in duty-free shops and whose daughters frequently grace the society pages. I thought this was a strange coincidence. There is no relation to Robert Miller of the film. Miller is an energetic, domineering man who worked his way from the middle class to a Gramercy Park mansion, a stylish wife (Susan Sarandon) who occupies herself with endless charity functions, a grown son and daughter who work at his company, and an exotic artist-mistress whom he sponsors. He has a lot on his shoulders, and suddenly it all goes to pot. He can't tell anyone. He must cope the way he knows best: wheel and deal and exude confidence. Will he land on his feet? Do we want him to? He's not a bad guy, but he's not especially likeable either. He is no more or less ethical than average. Richard Gere has played this role before, notably in \"Unfaithful\", a more sophisticated film.There's nothing original here, but the cast is good. There is a practical, world-weary wife. A temperamental mistress who craves attention. A morally superior but nave daughter. A son who has proven to be a disappointment. It's unfortunate that Susan Sarandon does not have more to do. Tim Roth steals his scenes as a crooked, desperate police detective. A stereotype, yes, but Roth makes him menacing. Nate Parker is sympathetic as a young man to whom Miller turns for help and who ends up in a very bad spot on account of it. On one hand, I felt that there should be more to this story. And the police investigation into the accident strains credibility. On the other hand, stock characters are not a bad way to begin a career in filmmaking. This is Nicholas Jarecki's first effort at directing a feature and second screenwriting effort. \"Arbitrage\" looks good. And the cast elevates a hackneyed script into an entertaining and suspenseful character study.The DVD (Lionsgate 2012): There are 6 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary. \"A Glimpse into Arbitrage\" (12 min) interviews the film's producers, director Nicholas Jarecki, and several members of the cast about the ideas behind the film and its locations. \"Who Is Robert Miller?\" (7 min) interviews the cast and director about the Miller character and Gere's performance. There is an audio commentary by writer/director Nicholas Jarecki, who explains how he came to be interested in making films, this film's conception, trials in getting it made, and eventually gets around to commenting on the actual film. He goes into detail about Miller's financial situation, his character, and the motivation of characters, as well as some technical details. Comment is constant but not always about what's on screen. Subtitles are available for t he film in English and Spanish."
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere is the best part of this film. In it he plays a billionaire who stands to lose everything because of a bad deal with a copper mine and so the lies come out as things go from bad to worse.Unfortunately most of the plot points were overly predictable but fortunately the performances were delivered better.Susan Sarandon plays the wife of Gere and you can tell early on that the couple is  disconnected one. Also starring Tim Roth as a police detective.A message of rich people getting away with it but it lacked any depth or twist or anything remotely interesting enough to push it above average. Also, you had Gere and Sarandon and that was the best you could do with them?The budget for this picture was not listed (always suspicious and likely that means a loss) and it made a bit over $22M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; MORALITY FOCUSES/MESSAGE: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2013."
B009AP3HQK There may be spoilers.In a role Richard Gere was meant to play, Robert Miller is an investment tycoon who loses his way, both with his family and his business.  Miller has hedged a financial deal that invests in a Russian copper mine.  When the Ruskies hold up the currency transfer, Miller has to borrow $400 million to make the books look right for a pending sale of his company.  When the guy who lent him the dough wants it back, Miller desperately tries to close the deal before the fraud is discovered.  That is just the beginning of his problems.His daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) is also a senior officer in the company and starts to smell smoke coming from the cooked books.  Miller's wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon) heads the charity wing of the company and suspects Robert is having an affair...which of course he is.  Now it really gets interesting.  Miller had invested in an art gallery run by a young French beauty (Laetitia Casta).Driving to a late night of romance in Julie's (Casta) car, Miller dozes off and flips the car killing Julie.  Miller survives with bruised ribs, calls a friend to pick him up and attempts to cover up his involvement.  Tim Roth plays a detective who for some reason suspects Miller was in the car.  This never made much sense to me.  There was no proof but all of a sudden Miller is the chief suspect in leaving the scene of the accident.All of these story lines conflate around Miller's financial woes.  Director and screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki meanders a bit and certainly the film has a few holes, but Gere's performance is a good one, making the film worthy of a look."
B009AP3HQK This was not a good role for Richard Gere.  He has made movies I have enjoyed. \"Unfaithful\" for example. Mr. Gere just wasn't believable as a tough arbitrager.  The plot was about as exciting as watching paint dry. I fell asleep twice, the car crash woke me up once. The second time was when my dog wanted to go outside.  I gave it 2 stars for the scenery."
B009AP3HQK What a waste of talent.  The film actually looked starved for cash. The interiors, the costumes not the sort one would expect for people at the upper end of things.  The script was poor, the acting blah, no pace to speak of and (for me) the whole thing just tedious.  A pity, Gere is better than this."
B009AP3HQK Arbitrage features several interesting character studies as well as a look at the varying ethical standards of those characters -- all set within a suspenseful tale. The film starts slowly, but picks up just a few minutes into it. My only complaint is that some dialogue was so faint or mumbled, it was impossible to hear it. All the actors, even those in minor roles, did a good job. If you're a Gere fan, you'll appreciate the fact that he's in almost all the scenes."
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, what could go wrong?  The ending, that's what. Folks could rate this movie 1-5 stars based on their likes, interests, their taste in \"film\", blah, blah, blah.  It held my attention, it was mildly tense throughout the movie, but the end feels like rape.  Rape of my time and attention.  Only one time in my life have I taken note of a director... that was M. Night Shyamalan.  Sixth Sense was amazing and all my years of critiques, editing, writing, and reading, that one movie was one that caught me entirely unprepared, but satisfied.  But then, his constant and consistent failure since has convinced me to avoid anything he participates in.  Now, for the second time in my long life, a director has caught my attention. Nicholas Jarecki for Arbitrage.  Should his name ever come to my attention again I will avoid the product related to him.  All my life I've studied writing, editing, entertaining in creative forms as a matter of a love for it. Stephen King, very well loved, doesn't cross my desk after years of horrible \"non\" endings.  I'm inclined to writers like Dean Koontz and J. Michael Straczynski... people who appreciate their audiences and don't play idiocy with them. They have the guts to write a climax that leads to a sensible conclusion that satisfies the consumer.  If you think \"Highly praised\" aka \"art\" or \"artistic\" is \"just wonderful\", then waste your life watching movies like this one. Better still, find a foreign film where you can read the closed captions and miss the acting for your entertainment... personally, I would prefer a book if I have to read. You have to take this review based on its title, Instant Review... I rarely get upset unless my valuable time is infringed upon.  If you don't mind being moderately entertained for around 100 minutes and then going to the bathroom and missing the whole climax and conclusion, you'll like this film.  I can't give zero stars, one star would insult the 95 or so minutes of great acting and tension you'd expect from 'drama'. So two stars with the warning, 100 minutes are YOUR minutes and you deserve to enjoy all of those minute, not 95% of them."
B009AP3HQK Really wonderful very true view of the Rich corporate business people of our society, who use their family to make themselves look good to the outside world, yet not caring enough to be there for the people who got them there.  Richard Gere played Robert Miller and played Ellen Miller Susan Sarandon the husband and wife team, who find out quickly when trouble starts knocking on their door that their lives are about to change big time.  They did a marvelous job as always when it comes to the characters they played, as well as the entire cast with Tim Roth as one of the detectives in the movie.  A must see movie for all adults to watch and learn what the rich are all about and that is selfishness......Here is the link below for an enjoyable Friday or Saturday night movie for adults only:B00ARANA00"
B009AP3HQK Great performance of how deep someone can get into trouble.. Only the Rich people could still come out on top.."
B009AP3HQK I love Gere in almost everything he has ever done, this would be my exception.I found this movie very confusing and boring.  There is too much going on and too many sub-plots.Tim Roth was annoying as the dogged detective.My favorite character is the young black man, played by Nate Parker,  who helps Gere; he had the only part I believed.Susan Sarandon was almost invisible; if she spoke 10 lines throughout that was a lot.  And she's such a good actress.Brit Marling, playing the daughter, was an Ivanka Trump wannabe without the intelligence, beauty and sense of style and humor.  Bad choice.I would be astounded if Gere got an Oscar nom for this as people who are interviewing him are all saying.  He seems humble and probably knowsbest that this was no stellar performance of his.Don't waste your money, as I did."
B009AP3HQK I thought it would be like most of his movies; action-packed and fast-moving with a lot complicated scenes to figure out. I was very disappointed. The concept would have been ideal but the movies started too slow for me so I move on to another more interesting movie."
B009AP3HQK Very solid film. Good acting, just enough suspense and twists that kept the movie interestingly fresh. I found it to be a cross between Wallstreet and a drama somewhat similar to Unfaithful, (with Gere as well) but without the explicit material. It took quite a few scenes to realize where the movie was going, but once a certain incident happened, it really pulled me. Not a whole lot of action which I'm fine with. I just thought I'd throw that out there for those hoping to see a 20 minute car chase with loud machine guns popping off every second. I have to note that Tim Roth is amazing as the head-strong detective. If you like movies where very wealthy and powerful men have they're lives turned upside down and then try to wash they're hands of it, I think you'll enjoy this too. I wish Hollywood would make more throwback style movies like this and get them into theaters. I'm sick of sequels and CGI."
B009AP3HQK \"Arbitrage\" (2012 release; 100 min.) stars Richard Gere as Robert Miller, the owner and CEO of Miller Capital, a Wall Street investment firm. Soon enough into the movie, we learn that Miller has all kinds of business and relationships issues/problems, and in fact each of these problems could've easily by themselves filled a whole movie: from the business side, it appears that Miller's firm is mysteriously short $412 million just at a time when the firm is about to be sold at a large profit. Miller borrows the funds to cover up the hole, but that puts only more pressure on him as the lender now wants the loan repaid. From the personal side, Miller is having an affair with Julie, a French up-and-coming art gallery owner. Late one night, as Miller and Julie are diving off, Miller nods off, causing the car to flip over and Julie is accidentally killed. Miller decides to flee the scene.At that point we're maybe 20 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would truly ruin your viewing experience. The tension does not let up, as we watch and wonder (i) whether Miller can pull off the sale of his company despite all of the financial and accounting irregularities, and (ii) whether Miller will be able to get away with the accidental death of Julie. You'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out.Several commments: this is the first feature from writer-director Nicholas Jarecki, and he shows a lot of talent and promise. At times the movie felt very Hitchcock-like. Second, the acting performances are excellent throughout, but there are two I'd like point out: Richard Gere, of course, now at age 63 and in his best role since \"Unfaithful\" in 2002, and he is already being mentioned as a serious candidate for a Best Actor Oscar nomination; and also Brit Marling, who plays the Ivanka Trump-reminding role of Miller's daughter and right-hand person in the company. I saw her earlier this summer in the excellent indie movie \"Sound of My Voice\" (which she also co-wrote and produced) and she is rapidly rising amoung the ranks of today's female actresses (except that she also directs, writes and produces!). Keep an eye out for her, as she is definitely going places. Meanwhile \"Arbitrage\" is a thoroughly entertaining financial and crime drama. The movie house where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and as Bjork's \"I See Who You Are\" starting playing over the closing credits, there was an applause from the audience indicating its approval and then some. \"Arbitrage\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
B009AP3HQK I love Richard Gere and he was the reason I recently purchased this item.  He did not disappoint.  The writing and all the acting is so good.  The storyline is totally believable.  I used to work for an Investment Specialist and know how this could happen. There is lots of suspense, drama and, of course, some a love triangle.  Highly Recommend!"
B009AP3HQK Richard Gere makes a few attempts in this film to be the decent actor he has been in the past. Howev
B009AP3HQK This film is a big waste of talent.  Richard Gere at 60 still is charming and has a great hair cut.  Poor Susan Sarandon didn't do so well.  Somehow they managed to make her look fat and unattractive.  The others are uninteresting.  Some attractive but boring blond girl plays their daughter.  You'd think a child of theirs would have some personality but no.  There's a detective who does a bad Columbo impersonation.  I'm ashamed that I sat through the whole thing.  I kept watching just to see how the guy's troubles would end up and then....it was over!  What happened to him?  Frankly I didn't care much."
B009AP3HQK I rented this movie because I heard good things about Richard Gere's performance and I am a fan.  I agree that some of the movie was predicatable but the final resolution was not.  Gere's performance was great as was most of the other cast members.  It would have been nice to see more of Susan Sarandon but waht she does at the end makes up for her small scene time.  Worth watching at least once."
B009AP3HQK I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere.  Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it."
B009AP3HQK Arbitrage(released Jan/12) stars,among others,Richard Gere as Robert Miller,Susan Sarandon as Ellen Miller,Tim Roth as Det.Bryer,Brit Marling as Brooke Miller,Laetitia Casta as Julie Cote,Nate Parker as Jimmy Grant,Stuart Margolin as Syd Felder,and Chris Eigeman as Gavin Briar.Yes,the name says it all,the title meaning taking advantage of a disparity in markets and reaping profits,ideally,with zero cost.And the film is all business too,with all the actors here turning in a very good performance.The story finds Gere as the head of a large corporation.Things seem perfect in his world,with a lovely wife,daughter and a thriving business.Slowly we learn things are not all that rosy.He invested heavily in a copper mine in Russia and at first things were rolling along tremendously.Later the countrie`s export rules changed and Gere was left holding the bag and had to fork out millions he didn`t readily have.He took from his own investors to plug the financial gap in the books;taking from Paul to pay Peter.In the end it still left a $400,000,000 gap that he plugged with a friends money.However now the friend is calling in his loan just before a rival company is about to possibly buy Gere`s company,which would close the gap.One night he visits the gallery of a young French girl who is a budding artist,who he bankrolls and has had an ongoing affair with for some time.They take a ride out to a place of his outside of NYC that he owns.On the way he briefly falls asleep and the car flips over several times.His amour is dead and he is devastated and panicking.He makes a phone call to a young man.His father,who used to work for him,and asked Gere,when he passed away,to keep an eye on as he grew up.He asks him to come and fetch him and take him home.On the way to make the call the car Gere had been driving blows up.Gere arrives home and disposes of the security camera evidence in his apartment and burns his shirt which had blood on it.As the movie progresses the heat gets turned up ever slower,whether it is the police sniffing around Gere,and/or the police putting the heat on the young man.Also the man responsible for wanting to buy his firm keeps putting his offer off,while he keeps sending underlings to negotiate for him,which stresses Gere ever more.Adding fuel to this ever growing out of control fire,is Gere`s daughter who is his chief accountant.She has discovered the gap in funds and is pressuring him to come clean on the reasoning behind it.Working for Gere is his lawyer,who is pulling every trick out of his hat he can for Gere.He has obtained an excellent lawyer for the young man who picked him up that fateful night,and who now the police are attempting to indict.Gere also is forced to tell his daughter the truth about the gap in funds and she is devastated that he not only hid it from her but that she could also lose her license.The two don`t part on friendly terms.At the height of all the heat,Gere is finally able to have a tete a`tete with the man who has been offering to buy his company.Gere gambles by coming on strong and gets his asking price and a signed deal on the spot.That is one major hole plugged.Then it is discovered some crucial evidence in the case against his young driver has been falsified and the case is summarily dismissed.Just as everything was set to blow up in his face,everything now starts to deflate and Gere,his finances and employees are all saved from disgrace.However there remains one last cog to be fixed....his wife.She confronts Gere and knows he wasn`t telling the truth about that fateful night and she also knew about the affair with the girl who died.For silence she wants him to turn over a major charity event`s holdings to her.He balks but in the end,if he wants his freedom,he will and he does.The film ends as Gere is attending his charity function to receive an award,with his daughter doing the intro and saying all the right things,with his ``loving`` wife by his side.As he stands ready to speak....fade to black.An excellent spot to stop the film on.This plot may seem like a variation on a theme,with yet another inside look at big business,how they operate,how corrupt they can be and how they wield their power.Goodness knows there has been enough of those types of films over the years.But this film has enough of a good plot,and some fine actors on board,to pull it off quite gracefully.I was surprised seeing ``Angel`` from the Rockford Files,Stuart Margolin,who turned in a very fine performance as Gere`s lawyer.There is a plot gap that,for me,was quite big.The police never did know the driver of the car that night,though they had their suspicions.Every car has a VIN(vehicle identification number)and even though the car caught on fire,it should still have been obtainable.They would have known right away who the owner of the car was through that.But that would have meant a shorter film,or a plot going in another direction than the writers wishes.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is some commentary.All in all a surprisingly good film and look at the head of a financially questionable company,who finds himself in trouble way over his head.Through a lot of string pulling and sheer luck he gets out from under it all.But at what cost.Recommended."
B009AP3HQK Started out great and built up wonderfully, then the plot got a little ridiculous towards the end. The acting however made it easy to suspend disbelief. Great great actors."
B009AP3HQK This is a very watchable film and it held my interest throughout.  Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and the rest of the excellent supporting cast are what makes this film go.  This is a financial thriller right out of today's headlines.  Richard Gere is a financial magnate who has made a large and unwise investment that has threatened to take his firm down.  He is groping for a financial lifeline, and therein lies this interesting story.  This is a thinking-person's film, but it tells the story very well.The problem with the film in my opinion is the unsympathetic nature of most of the characters.  Gere comes across as an unlikable hypocrite and his wife is no better.  The rest of the characters are swept up in Gere's amoral and immoral schemes, and somehow mostly come across as unsympathetic saps.  Well, that was my take on it; yours may be different.  Despite this flaw, this is an entertaining film that is worth watching.  RJB."
B009AP3HQK Very good movie that in some ways reminded me of Wall Street, but with an added plot twist that made the main character more desperate. That plot twist is Gere attempting to cover up a car crash that kills a woman in his car. You can feel his fear as he try's to pull of a deal to save his empire while covering up. Well done."
B009AP3HQK Ending ruined the whole movie. What was that? It's like they got bored with their own story and just gave up. Bummer."
B009AP3HQK Great movie and good storyline. Well acted. Love anything with Richard Gere in it. He just ages well, plays his character well, and fun to watch."
B009AP3HQK Yeah we've seen films like this before.  Good ones too (\"Wall Street\" and \"Margin Call\" come to mind for me).  But this one's pretty good too.Gere said (I'm paraphrasing) that this was like a film from the 1970's when films went into characters a bit more deeply, and also that it reminded him of Sidney Lumet.  I totally agree with those characterizations.  The plot didn't knock me out, but it's an enjoyable film."
B009AP3HQK Although I dislike the thought this could be or is true to such situations, it is probably more truth than fiction.  In that respect it is a good movie.  Gere is very good in this role as he has been in most of his roles.  It is worth watching.  Entertaining."
B009AP3HQK Great acting, engaging story with plenty of intrigue. I had read positive reviews and it did not dissapoint. I reccommend"
B009AP3HQK (SPOILERS) Feel as if I've seen a variation of this character so many times in film, super rich, caucasian, male, and still do not understand him...perhaps I never will.  Loved the actors, but the story...nothing new, why tell it.  Not to rag on the filmmakers, in the commentary the gentleman explained it took him forever to be allowed to direct.  But why this story.  Does every well off male character of a certain age have to have a mistress 20-30 years his junior and be a scum bag (lying to wife, cheating investors), ugh.  Such an unflattering picture.  I still do not understand what made him tick.  Maybe I'd need to be male to understand what drives him; as a woman, I'm sorry to say, he makes no sense to me (I may just be too slow, honestly).  Basically, in my opinion, the character in this film is presented as a successful, powerful businessman, but it is also clearly shown in the story that he is a criminal just smart enough to manipulate the system (legal system, capitalist system), to stay a step ahead of the authorities.  How is living your life a lie equal to success.  To me, the character was a liar, a cheat, and a criminal; and as he chose to live his life the way he did, he seems stupid, not smart.  But almost all the characters surrounding him either ignore his shortcomings (his wife), or maybe most just don't see them.  His daughter seemed shocked by his revelation of criminal activity, as if she knew nothing about him - it's not believable that the characters closest to him would know so little about him - he's not suddenly behaving this way, he's been behaving this way for a long time.  How could his adult children not have a clue to who he is.  He's not a flawless liar - I think his kids were underwritten.  Had the writer/director presented the character in a way I could understand, I would give the movie 3 stars, but I am still as confused about this type of fictitious businessman as I've always been, so I gained no clarity from the film.  Also disliked the women characters; the wife character (played by Susan Sarandon, a great actress) displayed no power until the surprise ending, so her sudden power at the end is not set up properly; and I'm so tired of seeing stupid women characters as mistresses to some dog who strings them along - can't we have a gorgeous mistress dump some jerk and go to school to get her masters degree or Ph.D; and the daughter had no power in the story, just a title.  Basically the Richard Gere character disrespected all the women - how is that attractive to any woman viewer.  Anyway, disliked the character Mr. Gere played (liked his acting, of course), and just wanted more from the women characters.  Hope the writer/director will try again and do better.  Regarding the use of the N word in the story, as a middle-age African American woman, it indicates to me how disrespectful the film business treats minorities with less financial power - the film business has a lot of powerful Jewish people, I very rarely hear Jewish racial slurs in the movies I see, but I often hear the N word - racial slurs shouldn't be in film stories unless they are sprinkled throughout for all the races, which they never are.  Just a thought to the film maker for future projects.  Maybe he'll think about it.  For instance, whatever his ethnicity is, how would he feel viewing films that lobbed racial insults at his group, at his ancestors.  There are alot of different people in an audience - not just the people financing films, all races view them.  I think we need to move abit closer to the concept of world film, i.e., respecting all life and thinking long and hard before inserting insulting racial slurs in film.  Can't hurt and it may help."
B009AP3HQK It is always nice to get out while you are on top, before you are caught with your finger in the pie. This is what a dishonest, cheating Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is attempting to do. This is a semi-crime drama that comes at you rather fast with no time for character build up. Robert Miller is unlikeable, but the film doesn't build character for anyone else. I found myself rooting for minor characters who are more honest than Miller, but not puritanical.Brit Marling as the overly smart daughter played a convincing role, but Susan Sarandon as the wife did not have the lines she needed to excel. The individual scene dialouge was predictable. The film is more of a crime drama with the financial empire and deals being part of the background dealings setting up Gere's character.Might be worth watching once. A film you will forget an hour after you have seen it. Not a keeper.Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief sex, no nudity"
B009AP3HQK A very different ending that's for sure.  Richard Gere carried this film and deserved his Golden Globe nomination.  The movie has you rooting for the bad guy."
B009AP3HQK \"The more time that passes, the more lies that are told the worse it gets for him.\" When Robert Miller (Gere) the head of a hedge fund company tries to sell off the company he runs into a few snags. Wanting to get away and relax he and his mistress decide to head upstate. When they get into an accident a series of events begin that threatens the futures of all involved. I have to say that I have never really been a big Richard Gere fan but after looking back over the movies he has done lately I may have to re-think that. While he hasn't been in any really big movies he seems to be consistent and his movies are really entertaining and tense. This one is no exception. The first 20 min or so is a little slow but then it really picks up and grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, when you feel you can finally breath. This movie has it all: lying, cover-ups, death, deception, cheating, company embezzlement the movie has it all. I highly recommend this. Overall, very entertaining and tense. Keeps you watching all the way to the end, which seems to come too soon. I give it an A-."
B009AP3HQK This is one of those movies where one little mistake escalates into a massive tragedy.  Gere is great in this movie about a man whose seemingly perfect life is not all that it seems.  Everything turns to chaos when Gere&#8217;s character (under the influence of alcohol) flees the scene of an accident only for his lover to die in the car.  Everything then spirals out of control while he desperately attempts to cover the tragic events up.  I felt that this movie was well-acted, suspenseful, and very entertaining.  If you are into a dark thriller that touches on corruption, politics, and the proclivities of the upper class, you are sure to enjoy this one.T.S.

B009AP3HQK \"Arbitrage\" stars Richard Gere as a Wall Street hedge-fund tycoon Robert Miller. He is a family man, shrewd businessman and suave womanizer, who is on the verge of disaster. I should not write about here what kind of disaster (that comes in two forms) awaits Robert on his 60th birthday. All I can say is that, written and directed by Nicholas Jarecki, the film keeps us guessing what's next, following the story of this complicated man struggling to save what he holds dear.But the reason the film works is the presence of Richard Gere (nominated for Golden Globe), one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. You may not like the man he plays, but Gere makes the tormented protagonist more interesting than the usual stock character. The cast includes Susan Sarandon, Tim Roth, Brit Marling, Laetitia Casta, Nate Parker, and Graydon Carter, editor of \"Vanity Fair.\"As a thriller or a morality tale, \"Arbitrage\" does not offer anything new, but with Richard Gere's superb performance and Yorick Le Saux's lush cinematography, the film is a pretty entertaining ride."
B009AP3HQK Outstanding acting and a excellent movie. Every single actress and actor was very talented.  The movie was both suspenseful and thoughtful.  Basically, it was a character study of the morals and ethics of a ruthless business person and of those he manipulated and used to his advantage.  It gave a very thoughtful insight into the main characters justification for his actions, as he tries to tie his behavior within the acceptable boundaries of the ethics involved within human interactions. Unfortunately, the main character displayed all the signs of being a sociopathic narcissist. Ending? No there was no real ending, because in his world and sometimes in the world of business in general; as long the end (bottom line) justify the means (getting there) there is no blame. No one was really hurt...just a potentially disastrous near miss.  Life and business goes on as usual in the pursuit of gold and recognition..."
B009AP3HQK There are much better reviews on here that I intend to write, so if you want spoilers, look there.Being anti-Wall Street, and with an innate hatred for the bankers who get away with it all the time, I tried to sympathize with the Detective who felt the same. Why I couldn't genuinely root for the good guys, I can't say. That's the effect the movie had on me, and the main character."
B009AP3HQK Well-known cast with a story-line that was just average.  Did not really hold your interest in that most of the outcome was rather predictable.  Felt more like a TV movie.  Worth watching but just not outstanding.  Susan Sarandon's role was rather limited in scope."
B009AP3HQK I was skeptical going into this movie. Nothing really good can come out of Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere when they want to \"denounce\" corporate greed. Everything was clich&eacute; in this movie. Down to the donation of 2 millions to a cancer research foundation, that will be used to make the doctors more rich and famous for nothing. They will use the funds to have \"meetings\" in exotic places in order to \"share the information\" (I haven't seen a scientific meeting downtown Detroit in a while). They will use the money to have big dinners and share big awards between them and patting themselves on the back. No drug that will cure a real disease will ever come out from these big donations and galas. In spite of this, people still believe that they are doing the right thing by donating money to these foundations. What a waste!The plot is somehow complicated and we are not getting a real answer because the movie just ends!  Robert Miller (Gere) is a hedge-fund magnate (immediately you think he is the bad evil guy who deserves to die!) who has manipulated the books because of a bad investment (where else, in Russia) that cost him 420 millions. He wants to unload his company for approximately the same amount of money to replace the money before somebody checks the books (I guess he thinks that somebody who spends this kind of money, will not check the books first for accuracy,...but that is another story). One night while driving with his mistress he falls asleep and gets into an accident. She dies and he tries to cover up.Taking lessons of ethics and behavior in life from Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon it is quite amazing. I knew immediately even before the movie started that their goal was to denounce corporate greed and arrogant behavior. They didn't succeed in their goal since his mistress is not portrayed as a great person and we don't know much about her, just that she is of French origin. His wife is a cold selfish person that nobody should care about, and he is not greedy, he is just trying to cover for a mistake. They didn't want to make a real thriller or a mystery movie. They could have taken that route. That would have been a much better film. But they decided to make a (bad) propaganda movie. Just another complaint about people with money.  But wait: aren't they also arrogant millionaires that give their money to hedge-fund managers to make more money? And when I watched the extras I saw a patronizing Sarandon and a serious Gere lecturing us about the problems of the world and what is ethical or not.  What a bunch of pretentious hypocrites!Richard Gere performance is the same as in \"Pretty Woman\" or \"an Officer and a Gentleman\". Average, nothing special. When I heard rumors of him going for the Oscars this year against Daniel-Day Lewis in \"Lincoln\" it made me vomit. This film was already nominated for the Golden Globe which is a prelude to the Oscars. The only reason they will give him an award for this pathetic performance in this pathetic movie, is because everything is rigged in Hollywood and they want to promote their anti-Wall Street propaganda. Really don't understand why the Hollywood people will bite the hand that feeds them. I don't think that the average Joe buys their propaganda: \"white collar corruption\", \"corporate greed\", \"fair share...fair share\"...blah, blah, blah. These are clich&eacute; sentences that only minimum educated people (...like the occupy Wall Street moronic crowd) believe. This is totally illogical. Nothing in this film deserves even the mention of an award. And please people, get Susan Sarandon some decent clothes. She was dressed with rags like a homeless person throughout the movie. In contrast, Brit Marling was very classy (we can tell that she already worked on Wall Street) but Susan Sarandon...was really very casual (to say the least) for a hedge-fund magnate wife.The only bright moments in this movie are the performances of Jimmy (Nate Parker) and of Detective Bryar (Tim Roth). Great acting and really great presence. But still, trying to manipulate a picture and make up a poorly pixilated license plate was really cheap and sad. Anybody can do much better these days with a computer!Two stars only for Nate Parker's performance that really saves the film from the abyss where it really belongs together with the entire pathetic script."
B009C46UEK This is a great show for toddlers. It gives them good tactics for dealing with their toddler problems. I like to watch it with my daughter, and learn the songs that go with the lessons. I sing them to her when she is having a similar problem. She also likes to nuzzle me like Daniel tiger does at the end of his show and with his dad. ugga mugga... Its adorable and I love it. I also like it because it has the same vibe that Mr Rodgers Neighborhood did. I grew up with Mr Rodgers and seeing many of the characters from the neighborhood of make believe as the adults in this show makes me smile. I think this show had made a positive contribution to my experience as a parent, and to my daughters experience as a toddler."
B009C46UEK This show is amazing! It has helped my toddler learn how to deal with things from dealing with her anger to potty training to sharing and helping through their short stories and catchie tunes (which are short enough for her to remember and repeat). Daniel Tiger is one of the few I dont mind her watching (and doesnt drive me insane either)."
B009C46UEK Lovely animation with just enough familiar characters and songs from the original Mr. Roger's Neighborhood to make it a joy to watch for parents and toddlers alike. Cute rhymes that stick in your mind like, &#34;When you have to go potty, stop and go right away. Flush and wash and be on your way.&#34; are great reminders for little ones about the right way to do things."
B009C46UEK We love Daniel Tiger!!  Notice that I said We!!  I always look at Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood when the Grandkids are visiting.  We love the stories, characters, and the songs that reinforce good behavior.  We don't have a favorite character because we like all of them.  The colors are vibrant, and even my 15 month old Granddaughter enjoys watching it with us.  As soon as the kids hear the musical introduction, they come running.  I'm glad I have this option to view it at a time when the program is not being aired on television.  I enjoy Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood as much as the children do."
B009C46UEK After Mister Roger's passing, his wife has been very protective and respectful of his legacy.  Growing with him (like a lot of 25-40 year olds), I appreciate that his name hasn't been slapped onto any rubbish that tarnishes what he spent a lifetime building.This show is based on Mister Roger's Neighborhood of Make Believe.  It does a great job of teaching life lessons to kids.  Sharing, potty training, dealing with anger/frustration, etc.  My 3 year old loves it and he's been a big fan since he was 2.  I don't know how it will hold up with him as he gets older, but this is a perfect show for him right now."
B009C46UEK My stepdaughter downloaded the Daniel Tiger series for her daughter who is just shy of 2 years old to her Kindle Fire while on Thanksgiving trip.  It proved to be an entertaining, captivating series that gave Stella a lot of chuckles and squeals as well as giving mom some respite time :-).  Highly recommended."
B009C46UEK My whole family really loves Daniel Tiger! The show is based off of Mr Rogers Neighborhood. It has catchy little tunes used when teaching the &#34;basis&#34; of the episode and the characters in the show are cute and loveable. Awesome family show."
B009C46UEK Very colorful  show, and he loved the animals~He was quite i  'awe' of them. We liked their simple yet educational storylines. The music he liked, too~Fun show for the little ones!"
B009C46UEK As soon as this is on my little one is mesmerized. She loves the songs and voices (9 months old)!!"
B009C46UEK My 5 year old granddaughter loves this show. She started watching it last year and still will ask to see it again."
B009C46UEK Great show! Sends a wonderful message. DD sings all the songs.Can't wait until we potty train and can sing the flush and wash and be on your way song ;)"
B009C46UEK It does remind me a little of Mister Roger;s but in an animated form. My son loves it and really that is what matters."
B009C46UEK Daniel the Teddy is a perfect example of just how important it is to teach toddlers the correct way to act/react to everyday challenges. He and his friend help to benefit the socialization process in children by using familiar situations and problem solving, that results in teaching lessons to our little ones.The animation is cute, fluffy, gentle and respectful. Kids love the serenity and the peacefulness that Teddy tosses their way. It's more than a learning experience, it's a life of fun and friendship."
B009C46UEK annoying. 1 yr old did not like it compared to other shows like curious george and bubble guppies... . ."
B009C46UEK Daniel tiger is a loved tv show and charecter in my family. I have 4yr old and 6yr old boys who love watching daniel tiger!!"
B009C46UEK This reminds me of watching Mr. Rogers growing up.  My daughter likes this show.  It's cute and educational.  I also like that the animation is more mellow - nothing too crazy or fast moving, which is better for the little ones."
B009C46UEK My daughter loves this show (she's 3 years old) and I think it teaches good lessons.  The songs will get stuck in your head and you won't like that, but I think that's unavoidable."
B009C46UEK My 1.3/4 y.o. Daughter likes the show, its pretty cute, kinda lame for parents but pseudo educational for little ones.We watch it on PBS too."
B009C46UEK I love that part of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is still available to children of today. I am glad that my son likes it."
B009C46UEK Kids love Daniel Tiger because he is so extremely cute.  Adults who watched Mr. Rogers love Daniel Tiger because you get to see the puppets from the land of make-believe all grown up with children of their own.  It's a calm show that sweetly teaches lessons about friendship and life."
B009C46UEK My son enjoys watching this show. It teaches so much about character. The show keeps his attention. Don't have to worry about any of the content."
B009C46UEK This is another one that the grand kids fight over who is going to see what.  Youngest wants to watch all of the season before I turn it off."
B009C46UEK My kids love this show! The tunes are catchy and help kids remember good hygiene, sharing, taking turns, how to deal with anger, etc."
B009C46UEK Daniel tiger is funny take on Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. I always found Mr. Rogers to be a bit creepy and boring but Daniel tiger works as a cartoon. it's more fun to watch and I like the music. the kids remember the little educational lessons in the songs."
B009C46UEK My 2 yr old grandson enjoys this show and watches it them over and over again. He tries to sing the songs and even stopped to run and go pee pee when the show he was watching taught him to stop and go right away when he felt the need to go. He wants to brush his teeth when he sees daniel tiger do it. It has been entertaining as well as educational."
B009C46UEK I chose to rate this show 5 stars, because it's an amazing show to watch, and my almost 17 month old daughter loves it! I love it too. It brings back memories on when I was a kid and used to watch Mr.Rogers neighborhood. The legacy lives on for Mr.Rogers. I'm glad they came up with this show in dedication to him. :)"
B009C46UEK This is a cartoon version of Mr. Rogers and they do a good job exploring many of the topics from the original show. My son loves this show and I enjoy watching it with him."
B009C46UEK I love this show for my daughter. She's two and its her favorite!  But what I really love most is the little song that goes with each segment, helping Daniel and the other characters learn about life. Those little songs help me get over the hump when she's stressed out about things like sharing on the playground, or going potty, all sorts of things.  Its all about the stuff that is completely new to a toddler, things that can be very frustrating for both of us! I only let her watch two shows, this one and Sesame Street.  Enjoy!"
B009C46UEK We watch this show all the time, and our 3 year old loves it! The show is not as apt to get her all wound-up like Dora the Explorer or Go Diego Go, but is anything but boring. It's the most modernized type of kid's show we have found yet from PBS that we really like as a family."
B009C46UEK There is really nothing not to like about Daniel Tiger. My 2.5 year old loves it and I think my 10 month old daughter has a crush on Daniel. Her face lights up when its on:)The life lessons are perect and done in such a sweet but eduacational way. LOVE LOVE LOVEEven I get excited when i new episode airs"
B009C46UEK The format is based on the Mr. Rogers series. Good story lines and no violence. This is another good preschooler show!"
B009C46UEK My kids 3 and 5 really like this. My daughter likes it because it's fun and she likes the song.My son likes the part when he goes to school and play with blocks :)"
B009C46UEK Daughter loves the cartoon, and esp. the games.................there is one game which you can add stickers or somethign everytime you tap the screen, and she loves it (but I have turn the sound down cuz it gets on my nerves)  Looks fabulous on the mini iPad."
B009C46UEK My 7 month loves Daniel. When the Tiger is on everyone must be quiet and all focus is on. I was happy to find this with Prime."
B009C46UEK Our 2 year old son LOVES Daniel Tiger and seems to live by everything Daniel Tiger does!  It's a great example for kids, like how to share, how to play together when you don't want to play the same things, how to deal with anger, cleaning up your toys, and &#34;grownups come back&#34; when they leave you at school or a baby sitter's.  Our whole family would highly recommend Daniel Tiger!  The stories, characters, and songs are adorable and everything positive we'd love our kids to understand."
B009C46UEK My three year old loves this show. Gonna be honest i did not like mr rogers naborhood as a kid i found it annoying for me daniel tiger is much less annoying than the original mr rogers naborhood, except when i have to watch my sons favorite episodes over and over again. Danieltiger actually teaches the little ones lessons how to calm down when they get upset ans sharing which my son's previous favorite show did not, so long spongebob daniel tiger is the man now in my house."
B009C46UEK i didn't know what this show was all about but my daughter sits still and watches it when i put it on. its very cute."
B009C46UEK So glad I have Amazon prime to run this over & over. Recommend this for all kids ages 2+. Free to watch on prime instant video"
B009C46UEK I (myself) haven't been privy to kiddy programs in quite a while.  (Daughter's in college) So when I was babysitting my sister's grand daughter I was at a loss as to what to choose for &#34;quiet time&#34; watching.  So I got out my Kindle Fire and SHE got to choose for herself!  What a hit!  Not only did she feel a little independant that it was HER choice but I was impressed (& comfortable) with her choice.  A kind and educational program we both got to snuggle on the couch and enjoy."
B009C46X8I Great show and can't wait for the second season to start. My boys love them and since the tv recording of them run at strange times, I like that I can purchase them on Amazon and always have them. Great series again!"
B009C46X8I My son and I have made it though all the episodes and agree that this is a great reboot.  For some reason it reminds me more of the original turtles then the versions that have come after.  I dont know if this was done on purpose but if you have read the original series you know what I mean.  It has been toned down for the audience but it isnt as silly as the cartoons and shows that have been on before.  You get introduced to everyone in this year and it opens up for a lot more in the future."
B009C46X8I I'll begin by saying that I was wrong. I'm of the generation that lived and breathed the 1987 Ninja Turtles. I first saw the trailer for this cartoon and thought it was a cheap CGI ripoff of the franchise.But then I watched the first episode and fell in love all over again. It made me feel the way I did all those years ago growing up with the Turtles. Except, unlike the 1987 cartoon, which hasn't aged well, this show looks and feels fresh. The 87 cartoon was corny and the animation was often inconsistent at best. By contrast, the writing for this series is actually pretty decent for a cartoon. Each episode is self-contained, but I like how the build upon a larger story with some continuous characters and elements. The action is well paced but also allows time for character moments. Best of all, the show is genuinely funny. Not goofy, corny, \"I can't believe I'm watching this\" funny, but some real \"laugh out load\" moments.I think this show has potential to revive the Ninja Turtles franchise. I dare say it might even be better than the 1987 series in some ways. Definitely recommended."
B009C46X8I Great for Nostalgic Fans (and probably kids too). Made by people who grew up with, and loved the 80s cartoon, and it shows."
B009C46X8I This is amazing it taught my daughters that ninja skills can also defend them not just to kick anyone butt"
B009C46X8I will please my little grandchildren and me. We love the turtles and have even bought masks to wear while watching."
B009C46X8I Turtle power"
B009C46X8I Let me make one thing clear: there is nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. Well, its CGI equivalent, anyway.It seems to do everything right. The animation is stylish without ever taking itself too seriously. It draws many of its styling cues from the hugely successful 80's series, but always in a relatively subtle way. It never merely apes its progenitor, but from the opening titles to the color of April's shirt, it constantly pays homage to that august predecessor. It even knows when to turn squarely in the opposite direction: we get the \"angry\" Raphael from the real original version of the turtles - the Eastman and Laird comic books - rather than the jokester first minted in the \"kiddified\" Archie Comics version, which then went on to become world famous in the first turtles cartoon.So this is a show that's stylish, clever, and certainly light years ahead of the 80's cartoon on any kind of technical level.And yet...For me, this series never quite pops. Something's missing here. Certainly none of the characters have the stand-out charisma of the original animated versions of Shredder and Krang. The way those two would bicker like an old married couple; the way that version of the Shredder would groan with such heartfelt outrage at each fresh ignominy visited upon him. An enormous amount of the original show's appeal came directly from that evil duo. Even Bebop and Rocksteady grabbed your attention and brought an out-loud laugh to your face in a way that nothing in this latest version does. If I had to put my finger on just one thing as lacking in this latest version, I'd have to say that it's really GOOD bad guys.Like I said in the beginning, there's nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. It's just that... Well, whatever \"X Factor\" may be, the 80's version had it, and this one just doesn't. I want it to - I swear I do. Because on the surface at least, this is a series that's making all the right moves.I want to love it. I really do.But somehow... I just don't.Theo."
B009CH0T9O After spending many years in the antique business, I am constantly amazed by the super job Rick and his group do on American Restoration.  And it is fun seeing many things I haven't seen before as well as ones I have.  Some background on items as well as the fun of seeing the look on the faces of the folks who have had some fabulous treasures to hold on to is priceless!"
B009CH0T9O I love this show!!!  I love how they take an object that someone treasures and even though it looks like crap, they know that it has meaning for their customer and they want to enhance that feeling by bringing the object 'back to life.'  What a great job they have!"
B009CH0T9O I like watching the items that people want restored. I wonderwhat people will do with these items years from now. They ll say why did I do this"
B009CH0T9O I use to watch this show on the History channel back when I paid Dish for everything, thank god I'm done with them. I love watching this show."
B009CH0T9O I always watch this series because it brings back some of my favorite memories.  The things that he restores are normally from a time period when I was a kid."
B009CH0T9O Hey don't get me wrong still watch this show it is cool BUT get rid of the drama and bring back the bringing back.  I want to see you restore not wash the laundry"
B009CH0T9O Simply a fun show to watch. To see the transformation of the various objects that are restored is amazing and educational."
B009CH0T9O Rick Dale is an amazing artist and perfectionist. He can turn a rusty piece of junk into a museum piece. We like most of his workmen too each plays a part of making dreams come true."
B009CH0T9O Great Show!  I love how they can take what looks like a 'hunk of junk' and return it to it''s originalbeauty.  I am a Amazon Prime member and I will pay the 'rate hike'.  Just looking for new seasons."
B009CH0T9O GREAT BUT THEY DONT SHOW RESTORING THE OLD ITEM LIKE LAST SEASON....BUT STILL GOOD!!! I WATCH WHEN RERUNS ARE ON"
B009CH0T9O Just a LITTLE something. I still thoroughly enjoy the show, but they've lost a step and it started last season. You don't really get to see them doing any of the WORK anymore. I thought it was really neat to see the process of how they restore those run down antiques. Now the customer drops off the item, and then, two scenes later, it's just done and being presented to the customer. You only get a brief summary of what they did, but you rarely see any of it anymore. It's a shame. I hope they get back into that some day. Still a four star show just to see the restorations though."
B009CP7SQI I was a huge fan of Bones when it originally aired.  I've read the books this series is based upon, I work with \"squints\" and I thought the writing was spot on, especially the cultural conflict between the scientists and the ordinary joe, i.e., Booth. The original seasons creatively worked through those conflicts and demonstrated how a team can be formed from this kind of diversity.  However, this season has become a characture of that original season.  The characters who had grown are regressing.  Bones is becoming every negative quality that can occur with an over inflated ego and it is not pleasant to watch.  She's superior, hypercompetitive and she doesn't seem to realize that everyone has both strengths and weaknesses -- including her.  If the writing doesn't somehow curb this trend I won't want to be around her and I sure won't tune in to watch."
B009CP7SQI The above was a quote from one of the &#34;squints&#34; (forensic anthropologist/lab geeks) in Season 6 or 7 of this show.  I found Bones on Netflix and became obsessed with this show about a forensic anthropology lab at a thinly-disguised Smithsonian (&#34;Jeffersonian&#34;) that pretty quickly and happily becomes completely hijacked by a charismatic FBI agent.  Thanks to Amazon I'm all caught up on the series.  The writing is generally very good, with scientific gee-whizish-ness alternating with funny or heartbreaking moments of all-too-human emotion from people who never forget that the remains they are working with were people.  Because of the generally high standard of the writing, I forgive the occasional clunky dialogue or wacky plot twist:  why would a serial killer become obsessed with a forensic anthropologist?  Similarly, the chemistry between all the actors, especially the two stars, allows me to overlook the occasional wooden moment. I recently watched the first few episodes from the first season over again and realized just how much the characters had grown over time.  All in all, if you have a strong stomach -- and don't mind seeing someone else's (the special effects remains-wise are really convincing) I highly recommend seeing this dramedy."
B009CP7SQI the bones season eight has had a lot of surprises in it like the on e from 3 or 4 episodes ago."
B009CP7SQI This is a great show. I have to say I liked the first seasons more, but they finally worked out most of the kinks and are on track to get back to the traditional plot lines."
B009CP7SQI Seasons 1-6, I'd give this series 5 stars easy.Granted you had to turn your brain off on certain aspects of it, but the shows in general were crafted quite well, if unbelievable.  The characters were likeable and the series took chance;  many of those chances I didn't really agree on, but still it moved the plot forward.I mean seriously malware delivered as a fractal pattern etched on the end of a bone that is scanned in and causes a whole data centers fans to shut down?I'm lucky to get a 2D object scanned in at 300 dpi, let alone have the scanning software trigger some sort of data center cascade.This last series, isn't bad per se, but seems like they are coasting quite a bit.  Humor isn't quite there, plot lines are of the single episode variety (no season wide big bad).I still watch it, hopefully, but to date, mildly entertaining at best."
B009CP7SQI it a great show and alway good story line and never get bored. i am glad it will be back next year!"
B009CP7SQI I have really enjoyed this season of Bones, Love how Bone's character is growing since she has become a mom and her relationship with Booth has grown and changed can't wait to see what else they are going to do."
B009CP7SQI WHY am I paying to watch commercials both before & after the show?! Iam NOT going to continue paying for these shows with commercials! I have a very limited amount of internet and these stupid commercials take up a valued portion! STOP MAKING US PAY FOR COMMERICIALS!!!!"
B009CP7SQI I can't say that I've ever seen a &#34;Bones&#34; episode that I didn't like, so, of course, I bought season 8 and some others.  I don't mind seeing something I like more than several times."
B009CP7SQI My 5 year old loves the show and the music..even my 10 year old was hooked for a while. We started giving other shows and movies a \"bone\" name so that he just agrees to watch them ( \"Indiana Bones\")..unfortunately he learned the difference quickly...4 stars for that.."
B009CP7SQI Now that Bones is in its 8th season, the show is pretty established.  I do love the show...I love the chemistry of the cast.  Most of the time, I even love the eccentric openings.  Sometimes, it does seem to get a little scattered."
B009CP7SQI I've been with Bones since the beginning. There were times it was a love/hate relationship. This season is by far the best so far!"
B009CP7SQI i must confess that i now watch this show because i am so comfortable with it.  the characters seem like old friends.  they are now in slippers by the fire mode, which means that they are all, except for the shrink, long term couples with kids and likely to remain so.  it is a good thing they added the shrink in, Sweets, because he is the only one with an upside down love life which provides a little bit of needed romantic tension to the show.  this show has always had a hefty romance element to it so it is risky to let them all get too comfortable as old married or married-like people.the forensic cases themselves remain well done.  as usual, we always start out with some corpse that has little to no flesh left on it which means that a conventional autopsy won't do much good for the case.  instead, one must use a forensic anthropologist, a professional who can detect cause of death from the bones remaining in the skeleton. this show continues to use a fair amount of humor around these corpses as well, from its intricate discovery in the opening sequence to Hodgkins' explosive lab experiments.Booth still has the best ability to go with the comedic aspects of the show and I don't know how the show could survive without him.  He and Bones still make a compelling couple, professionally and romantically. i do miss some of their earlier highly comedic adventures, such as when they went undercover as circus performers."
B009CP7SQI But the story lines lack the draw of the earlier years, before everyone got together and made babies.  The pairing of Bones and Booth took away the flirty anticipation that was so much fun in the beginning years."
B009CP7SQI My one wish on these shows is to watch the actors grow, like they are real. My one beef is that Brennan hasn't really changed much. I feel like in the relationship with Booth she doesn't give back to him what he really wants. To know that she has a lot of &#34;heart&#34; for him. That if he was being accused of murder (like her father) that she would be a scapegoat for him as well.Best storylines ever. I love the Pellant series."
B009CP7SQI i love each characters storyline; the chemistry between the lead characters is wonderful!!  cant wait for the next and i love the ease of using this for streaming videos.  will NEVER use the apple store again to purchase/watch shows.  and with amazon prime, lots of free shows to watch."
B009CP7SQI This is a great show, but where has it gone on Instant Video?  There have been at least two episodes aired on broadcast tv (one in Dec and one in Jan) that have not shown up for purchase in instant video.  I'm missing my Bones fix."
B009CP7SQI We like the Bones episode because it is not a serial it is a new story with each episode- there is a beginning and a conclusion within that weeks story (few exceptions that carry over but very few).  I don't lie the soap opera scheme where nothing is ever resolved.  The story moves quickly.  The characters are interesting and the relationships are evolving which adds to the interest."
B009CP7SQI I love the way the writers combine comedy with often-gruesome forensic work. It's a little bit like &#34;CSI&#34; meets &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34;"
B009CP7SQI I am so hooked on the Bones series.  I have Netflixed all the previous 7 seasons and now am ready for the 8th."
B009CP7SQI The first installment was great.  Set up their most dangerous protaganist for further threats.  Kepy Flin in the loop and it is logical because their protaganist is basically a terroist.  As the lates Jame Bond movie highlights, future ward will have a front in cyberspace.  The other good show was the bombing of the twin.  The opening scenes featured the second grossest beginning in the Bone's series.  I don't want to state the grossest, because the writers might use a variation and I don't want to give them any ideas.  But I like the way Bones develop and add dimensions to their main characters and sending Sweet out in the field without Booth was brilliant.The other episodes were watchable, but not past the three star rating."
B009CP7SQI I absolutely love this show and download episodes to my kindle so I can watch them while on long plane rides.  Love it!"
B009CP7SQI I have been ordering the episodes via Season 8 because the difficult access occurred on hulu. I can always watch the episodes on hulu, but the problem is the episodes are restricted. I do miss when the show comes out on the T.V. scheduled (Monday nights). I work late on Monday nights, and I can only rely on Amazon Instant Video. That is my access. This works for me because I can watch it over and over."
B009CP7SQI This is not a show for the faint of heart, but if you can cut the mustard with the show's ultra realistic cadavers, this is a great show. The writing and story lines are better than ever in season 8, but I could be biased. The episodes vary their focus and don't stay on just the main charaters, giving them a much wider variety of topics to keeping it interesting and not letting it get dull. The acting and dialog are good, creating believable characters and let you see both strengths and weaknesses just as you see in real life. Good Job!"
B009CP7SQI It is so intelligent is the main reason I watch it. I love the characters but the plot and science drives the show"
B009CP7SQI One word for all season's and all episodes........AMAZING!!!!!!! Will never be another of it's kind like it. Wonderful family show."
B009CP7SQI I've enjoyed previous seasons of Bones more than this current season, although it's still a very good show.  I definitely prefer watching it week-by-week on Amazon Instant over waiting for it to show up on the network's website or on Netflix."
B009CP7SQI EPISODE 24-THE SECRET OF THE SEIGE : I thought this this episode started with a bang but wimped out at the end.  I did not like the fact that Boothasked Bones to forgo the wedding without telling her why: I was furious and almost threw the remote at the TV.  I understand that he wanted to protecther from Palant but he should not hurt her feelings like he did.  He's the one who has been wanting marriage almost from the beginning and pressuringDr Brennen to ask him.  She did and it brought tears to my eyes: they are meant for each other in the progam.  Emily Deschanel is an amazing actress asis David B.  The rest of the cast is good though I absolutely dislike the Sweets character, Edison and the tall skinny guy from the loony bin.  The sets are good, special effects fine and the photography excellent. Excellent humour also.  I get very emotionally envolved in the series, perhaps toomuch but I love the Deschanel sisters.  In my opinion the most beautiful women in America: I DO NOT LIKE BLONDS, ESP. BLEACHED ONES.  I am retired andhate to wait 4 months for season 9 but I guess I have no choice.  Overall I give Fox very high marks for the high standard production standards ofthis program though I get a little antsy with some of the flippet sex talks and I wish Bones would lay off the Catholic church.  Would she say the sameabout Islam?  But good going  Fox and the producers & directors & writers.  I only gave this episode three stars because of the ending."
B009CP7SQI as with all good shows, the characters  have developed as the show goes... good chemistry in the group ... and good casting to begin with......"
B009CP7SQI Excellent quality in audio and video. Love the Bones episodes. Have all episodes in the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO on my ROKU."
B009CP7SQI I've seen every one of Bones' videos and recommend it to every one.  It is well written, witty and real."
B009CP7SQI While some of the science in this show is not an absolute at this time, there is a lot of good material here.  I might have remained in Physical/Bio-archaeology if I could have gotten an internship at the Jeffersonian.  Alas, The Jeffersonian doesn't exist.  The characters are good.  And the plots hold your interest.  I also love the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle humor.Good fun watch."
B009CP7SQI really i would have given a 4.25, but it was not an option. i am not a big fan of much on tv, but most of the time &#34;Bones&#34; leaves me happy i watched. Like the idea behind the story--brainy woman and macho man and their personal interactions. also like all the rest of the characters and the way they've been developed. very entertaining. often thought provoking. wonderful music. frankly i thought once bones and partner were married off the writers would be hard pressed to keep the story interesting. they have done very well and continue to make this story work."
B009CP7SQI Are you kidding this is the best!!  Great mystery and detection but the stars are fabulous to watch.  David B. yummy."
B009CP7SQI I've followed the story of Temperance and Booth ever since the beginning and I am charmed, beguiled and in love with all the ensemble characters.  I also really appreciate the way they've all been allowed to adapt and develop.  It keeps the story fresh and original.  I know it can get a little silly and unabashedly romantic sometimes, but the scientific appearance and jargon, the excellent writing and the interaction between the personable charm of Booth and the beautiful remoteness of Bones balances it all out, for me, anyway."
B009CP7SQI Bones is always interesting. The cast works so well together and the technical aspects are really quite impressive. I find myself watching re-runs in between seasons. Looking forward to the new season!"
B009CP7SQI What's NOT to like about this show?!  It has everything, story lines, plots, mysteries, science, good looking actors and actresses who make their characters come to life and believable!"
B009CP7SQI From the very first show I was hooked.  Long running series allow the writers to fully develop their characters are the job they have done is great.  Would like to see Zack appear in another show.  Was not thrill with the latest eposide.  Will wait for final judgment to see if I continue watching."
B009CP7SQI I am very upset with amazon. I bought this and was unable to view it on my amazon fire. I tried contacting them 3 times nothing was resolved and I did not get my money back. Finally I tried my computer it worked but I did not buy it to watch on my computer. Now I hesitate to buy videos from axon knowing they may not be playable on my amazon fire"
B009CP7SQI this is a show I look forward to weekly.  I have been watching it since it started and think it is a great show."
B009CP7SQI An oddly original take on the feelings and reactions that will long remain to the events on September 11th.  \"Bones\" begins by reading a book written by the basketball coach, Phil Jackson, and decides his principles of play could apply to her team of interns in researching the back log of unknown remains.  Predictably, they all start out competitive to one another until one case emotionally grabs one team member.  The connections to the September 11th crash at the Pentagon sherlocks its way through a myriad of clues all the while prickling the fresh feelings for that day.Sometimes, 9/11 is used dramatically in a hackneyed way, to elicit emotion or a sense of gravity.  Not the case with this episode:  the slow walk to realizing the identity of these remains and the whys of their condition alternately confuses, angers, saddens and depresses the team now determined to find out who the person belonging to the bones is.  The results are stunning and tragic and genuine.I commend \"Bones\" for this episode, presented so close to Veterans Day, for acknowledging the tragedy and grief associated with this unforgettable day, September 11th.  A beautifully crafted episode worth the elicited good cry."
B009CP7SQI For all you red meat types who like your copycat CSI programs this is one has the most entertaining characters. Most of them are 100% dysfunctional but they dress to kill and again solve all their crimes with high tech lab junk and computers. Watch it while you eat to get the most from there defleshing corpses. Obviously they never smelled a three day old rotting body. Other than that it is fun."
B009CP7SQI Watching Bones evolve with more humor and understanding of her self eccentricities, is great... Love them together with Christine...  Seeing her with her Mom when she was in & out of ??? (life, conscientiousness) was wonderful... Love Ryan O'Neill as her Dad... All the characters are just like family..."
B009CP7SQI This show is one of the best Bones has produced, but I have to complain that I bought this video for my library and it came with commercials for the channel that airs it.  What???  I shouldn't have to watch commercials on videos I bought.  That is so incredibly LOW.  This is my last purchase for a wonderful show on a terrible channel.  It starts AND ends with commercials.  If you can figure out a way to strip them out, please share."
B009CP7SQI I really like Bones and the characters that are brought up in each episode. The main characters are fun to watch"
B009CP7SQI My local channel went down the night this was aired. SO I had to buy this episode off instant video. This was the best 9/11 episode that I have yet seen from a normal tv series and that is saying alot. The cast was excellent as you would expect too.  This time they had all of the interesting helpers that doctor brennan uses at hand. These are the rotating cast members that often appear in various episodes. Here they work together and the results are very good. (one of the rotating members was killed off a few seasons ago though). Bones chemistry between it's two leads has evolved and the show contiues to deliver on top scripts and flat out well done episodes. But this was one of the show's finest hours by far. The 9/11 storyline was both touching and poignant and the relationship between the formally pure intellectual Brennan and the heroic Booth character is welcome. Brennan has evolved through her interaction from her 'family' on this show from a cold distant analytical person to a more rounded person. Of course she was like that because of her terrible upbringing to be sure. (and her giant intellect only increased this situation). Even if you have never seen aepisode of this show this powerful one about sacrifice and rememberence will affect you. As one character says in this episode:'9/11 traumatized everyone that day\" and we often forget that."
B009CP7SQI The show has changed a lot over the the past two seasons but it still has more or less the same feel it has always had."
B009CP7SQI I love the characters and the theme of the show.  It keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat."
B009CP7SQI Have enjoyed the birth and the drama of Bones' vulnerability and being a Mom;  the chemistry between Bones and Booth is still on ..."
B009CP7SQI I love this show and I would recommend this show to everyone. and it did not mess up on amazon."
B009CP7SQI I  enjoy watching both actors the direction they are taking the show, their imput as directors and how they work well together. Of course the other actors ALL work very well together."
B009CP7SQI Bones is one of those rare quality shows blending humor, relationships, educational information, well acted and told episodes. FOX has now cheapened these qualities by sticking trailer ads for their other shows. Are they so insecure with their lineup? What a shame and bad precedent they are setting!"
B009CP7SQI I have watched Bones since day 1. I have been hoping Bones and Booth would get together since the first season. So this is the season I've been waiting for. I am really glad I bought the TV pass so I won't miss even one episode."
B009CP7SQI I thoroughly have enjoyed streaming the complete season of Bones.  The season has been excellent.  I hope this show just keeps going, season after season."
B009CP7SQI I really look forward to seeing this series.  It is intriguiging and fun.  Several story lines keep you glued to the TV and I don't watch a lot of TV.  In fact, this is one of the few programs I enjoy."
B009CP7SQI This is my husbands favorite show.  I have all six seasons on DVD.  Season seven we are watching on Amazon 'on demand'.  I did not personally like this show but as my husband enjoys it I bougtht the first six seasons.  I've found, over time, this show has grown on me and I thoroughly enjoy it now.  I think I disloked the main character 'Bones'.  But as the show has evolved and they have developed the characters and their interactions I've found it to be a very good show.  Consistant good scripts and fine acting.  I highly recommend this show."
B009CP7SQI This was a really interesting season, with a lot of development in Bones' character, and shows a lot of growth in the relationship between Bones and Booth. Pelant is so creepy, though, as a villain, and I hope they deal fully with him soon! A lot of fun stuff this season with the interns, Angela and Hodgins!"
B009CP7SQI I like \"Bones\". I watch it on Amazon since I don't have cable. The characters are great and i like the way they interact and even when a show story might be weak I just enjoy the conversations. The actors do a great job of portraying their characters. So why did I give this weeks show a 2? Mainly because Hodgens unequivocally states that 911 was not a conspiracy. There is no way if Hodgens really existed that he wouldn't at least keep his mind open. This is a political statement that the viewers are supposed to gobble up. Nobody wants to believe the truth."
B009CP7SQI Some really great episodes in this season.  The characters really develop in unexpected ways and a serial killer that is more than evil, and seemingly harder to catch."
B009CP7SQI I obviously like this show or I would not have bought the eighth season.  It is a good show always, and I love the characters.  So glad the season has been renewed"
B009CP7SQI THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SHOW IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE,( EXCEPT NOT APPROPRIATE FOR SMALL KIDS)WE LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING EACH EPISODE. ITS GREAT!"
B009CP7SQI I stiil enjoy the plot lines ,actors. If you what too many episodes, the story lines become repetetive. That's why I took a break."
B009CP7SQI I love Bones.  Its so nice to be able to watch a current show you have missed.  The stars keep you interted for minute one to the very end."
B009CP7SQI to the previous seasons. It has charm. It is sort of like a good homemade soup of a tv show."
B009CP7SQI I love Bones, but had gotten a season behind and I loved being able to buy the seasons and get caught up!  Such a great show!"
B009CP7SQI Seriously. We buy these to avoid commercials if fox continues this we will stop buying these videos. Want to test us? Keep the commercials and watch your revenue fall.Update 4/2/2013Since Fox has refused to stop the commercials I have cancelled this season and will not buy any more seasons of Bones. If this persists I will subsequently start cancelling / not renew all of my Fox shows. There are plenty of providers who don't put commercials in videos I pay for so I will not stand for having commercials impressed upon me."
B009CPH62Y What a pleasure! As a kid in the '70s I loved Niekro and Hough and the knuckleball in general. It felt like a pitch from another dimension, with its own laws and mystique, and this film confirms those thoughts and adds so much more depth to a pitch seen as a trick by many. It's a beautifully made documentary with a heartfelt love of the game, and a quiet sense of humor befitting its stars.It focuses on present-day knucklers Wakefield and Dickey but also includes the other five best-known purveyors of this unique pitch. It's no surprise to see how humble they all are, as the film points out that the knuckleball is often the last stop before retirement for most who throw it, and few have ever thrown it well. Most of those who have are here, and they're all fascinating individuals united by their common joy in throwing a ball as softly and wobbly as they can.It's their love and even reverence for baseball and its myriad peccadillos that make this film so special, because nothing in any ball game is odder than the non-rotating, dipsy-doodling path of a properly tossed knuckleball. The filmmakers weave a fine tale of the pitch's history with tight edits and sweet seques that made me feel like I was back in the '70s watching games in Fenway and Yankee Stadium, where I saw some real corkers (if few good knucklers). Because baseball players and especially pitchers last longer than most team athletes, most of these guys were in their thirties and even forties when they tossed their best, and that age gives and gave them a special perspective and gratitude that one rarely sees these days, let alone in pro athletes.Just as good as the film are the extras, two hours of excellent stuff on many related topics, including longer interviews with the pitchers, discussions of the physics of the knuckleball, and lots more fun stuff for any baseball lover. I really enjoyed watching Bouton pitch at a wall in his country home's yard; you can see he loves to throw the pill as much as he ever did, which reminds one that baseball really is the most one of a kind of all professional sports and that it inspires the same love of the game in its players as it does in its fans, a love that never dies.I can't recommend this film highly enough to any sports fan. It's a complete winner, and its subjects are such total gentlemen that it really does feel like an honor to be taken into their lives for a few hours.Cheers and thanks to all of them for daring to throw the ball at 65 mph and watch some of the best hitters of all time fall all over themselves swinging like mad at it. I've avoided the inevitable metaphors so far, but in closing it must be said that in the world of baseball movies, Knuckleball floats across the plate nice and slow, wobbling just above knee high and making the competition look like amateurs.Steeee-rike three!"
B009CPH62Y I'd hoped that in addition to interviews with knuckleball pitchers, the DVD would also show pitches in slow-motion, from angles that allowed one to clearly see how the ball behaves on the way to the plate. Also some description of the physics involved, and an explanation of why there are so few knuckleball pitchers. Didn't happen."
B009CPH62Y I'm not a sports person, but I do love the fact that people love games. Such innocence! Such fascination! (See Fr. Schall for how watching a game is a foretaste of the fascination of Heaven). There is a lot more to sports than sports, if you catch my drift. And the whole tale of knuckleball, what it is, how it has lifted players up and cast them down, is worth a look. Your husband will probably love it. But non-sports oriented wives too!"
B009CPH62Y I'm a huge NY Mets fan, so this really hit home for me. A great story for any baseball fan."
B009CPH62Y The knuckleball is an enigma in the sport of baseball.  Only a handful of pitchers in the 100+ year history of the game have thrown it well enough to make a career out of it.  This documentary focuses on two knuckleballers in particular (Tim Wakefield & R.A. Dickey) in trying to shed some light on both the physical and mental side of being a baseball oddity.There are basically two distinct themes running through this doc:1. A history of the pitch, so to speak, in which former knucklers like Charlie Hough, Wilbur Wood, Tom Candiotti, and Phil Niekro are interview regarding their thoughts on their bread-and-butter pitch.2. A narrower focus on Wakefield & Dickey, delving into more the psychological toughness needed to soldier on despite being label a baseball \"freak\", of sorts.This is a great little documentary for all baseball fans (especially those who vividly remember Wakefield's long career or Dickey's magical run with the Mets) and is about as unique as the fluttering pitch itself (I can't remember any other documentary covering similar material).  It is lighthearted, emotional, informative, and serious all at the same time.The only reason I can't give it the full five stars?  I wish it would have focused on the personal stories of Wakefield/Dickey even a bit more.  Their interactions with the \"old gang\" of knuckleballers is great, don't get me wrong, but there are WAY too many slo-mo shoots of fluttering knucklers used simply to fill time/space.  The personal stories would have been compelling enough to explore even more fully.Overall, though, this is a fun little baseball documentary that is very professionally produced and doesn't try to \"ruffle feathers\" by making outrageous statements for publicity's sake.  It is clear that the filmmakers were truly interested in and inspired by their creation and that fact shows in the final product."
B009CPIQQE It sucked as a movie. The sound was scratching in spots well a lot of spots but I don't think that is Amazons fault. Withing minute from the start you knew the entire movie before it happened."
B009CPIQQE hahahahahhahhaah  this movie is EXACTLY like it's name... H-O-L-L-O-W...  Oh gosh, this was bad, really bad!  Save yourself; don't even think about pushing play.  Ha!"
B009CPIQQE Let me clarify this from the get-go: I'm not one of those reviewers who seeks to kick the stuffing out of `found footage' films.  All you need to do is peruse the reviews I've done here at Amazon or elsewhere to know that I'm entirely accepting of this sub-genre.  I'd go so far to say that I enjoy them quite a bit so long as there is some quality story, development, and characters at the heart of whatever footage the producers allege to have found.  Granted, I do believe these flicks work best as horror upstarts, but that doesn't mean I won't appreciate a few dramatic turns here and there, and, to its credit, HOLLOW thinks it knows what it's doing in presenting four young folks - two couples, basically - enjoying a weekend outing in some romantic and spooky setting.  Unfortunately, HOLLOW should've known better.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)There's a tree on a hill in the middle of a small remote village that - rumor had it - has been haunted by a local legend ... for, in the hollow of this massive, somewhat disfiguring tree, there lives a dark spirit that seeks out young lovers in the midst of some relationship strife and convinces them to commit suicide.Now, if you stop right there, I'd argue you have the makings of a possibly mystical thriller.  You have all the right elements - an evil place, an evil spirit, and an evil cause - that coulda, woulda, shoulda made for a nice picture.Unfortunately, then they made the film.Emma , a/k/a `the innocent one' (played by the lovely Emily Plumtree), and Scott, a/k/a `the alpha male' (Matt Stokoe), long for a weekend away from it all; and, hoping to share it with a few friends, they invite James, a/k/a `the jilted ex with a troubled past'(Sam Stockman), and Lynne, a/k/a `the slutty one' (Jessica Ellerby), to join them.  Emma's grandfather - the pastor for a small, country village - recently passed away, and they're heading there to make use of the premises, despite the fact that it has no electricity.  Once there, they find themselves all equally creeped out by the legendary tree of local lore, and, before their weekend getaway is over, they may find out just how real and deadly folklore can be.Some `found footage films' clearly give `found footage films' a bad name, and HOLLOW is part of that growing group of flicks made clearly to capitalize on a sub-genre but not provided enough spine upon which to build a perfect body.  In fact, all there is to HOLLOW is its twist ending - not all that big of a twist, and certainly one you can see coming from ten miles away.  These characters aren't given any legitimate depth - though I've read some reviewers who think the introduction of relationships and faithlessness accounts to `character development' (here's a tip: it doesn't) - and, instead, they're all archetypes plopped into a `locked box scenario' with very little hope of escaping.In that respect, much of HOLLOW works just fine.  There's a benign charm to some elements of the film - the introduction of the local church mythology surrounding the suicide tree, the fact that there exists more than ample evidence to support some paranormal phenomenon in the vicinity, etc. - that work well enough to establish the premise; however, when writer/director Matthew Holt essentially delivers an ending an audience knew from their very first frame, why bother at all?  Why not, instead, give viewers a legitimate reason to hang around for 90 minutes by creating characters that mean something more than just fitting the stereotype?  These are four relatively self-centered and stupid individuals who one could argue get just what they deserved for being so mind-numbingly self-centered and stupid.  Don't be shocked when they get their comeuppance.Sadly, a sense of `nothing new here' pervades so much of HOLLOW.HOLLOW is produced by (how fitting?) Hollow Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through New Video.  As for the technical specifications ... well ... the video looks and sounds about as good as the next `found footage' flick, though I'm alarmed by the increasing use of a camera at night when the characters are running while essentially filming the ground.  Sound is good, but the herky-jerky camera work really could've been improved.  Also, there's an awful lot of turning-the-camera-off (to save battery near the end), but, boy, it's sure good that they turned the camera on just as something was about to happen!  (Don't give me that gobbledy-gook about them \"needing the light,\"either.  I didn't just fall off a truck.)  As for the special features, there's only a two-minute \"story behind the scene\" wherein the director gives you his two cents about how and why they shot the ending the way they did; it's interesting, but it ain't all that special, nor much of a feature.RECOMMENDED only if found footage films are REALLY your thing because, otherwise, I'd be hard-pressed to see what value one might find in HOLLOW.  It isn't that it's poorly made because, in most instances, the production quality is there.  While I wouldn't agree with some stylistic choices made, I strongly disagree with those who think there's a winning 90-minute story here because there isn't.  At best, it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out into 90 unnecessary minutes.  Once you experience the \"engrossing and effective\" ending (their advertising words, certainly not mine), perhaps you'll agree.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of HOLLOW for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B009CPIQQE The &#34;found footage&#34; approach worked as a novelty in The Blair Witch Project.  Once was enough.  This one appears to imitate that style.  We could not enjoy the shaky amateur photography used in such films.  For that reason, we watched only ten or fifteen minutes of this one before moving on to something else.  In fairness, it may have had some good points, but we did not stay to find them."
B009CPIQQE Utilizing the increasingly popular \"found footage\" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, \"Hollow\" takes a rather slight story and serves up exactly what you might expect. It seems like many absolutely loathed \"Hollow,\" but I think some of those people were expecting a full-on horror show. There is some creepiness, but this presentation doesn't show you much of anything that will actually scare you. It tries to get you to jump at jarring noises, that's the extent of its thrills. Neither particularly good or bad, this is a film with limited ambition or originality. I watched this with a friend, and when the movie ended--he turned to me and said \"well, that was just what I thought it would be.\" It's not that either of us hated the film--far from it--we simply thought it lacked any real element of surprise. It's reasonably well made and the actors are appealing enough. It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint. You've seen it all before and oftentimes better.Four friends venture to the countryside to a family estate for a weekend. Set in Suffolk, England, the house borders a creepy monastery with a history of driving local youths to suicide. The friends, comprised of two couples, make the best of things with no electricity and increasingly mysterious goings-on. As usual, it doesn't occur to anyone to leave until things have progressed too far. As an extra annoyance, they decide to film absolutely everything. Yes, this is one of those movies! Someone is always holding a camera! Tension, and even madness, starts to infiltrate the group. Can they work against a curse? Can they survive a murderer? Can they stay united? Just what is out there in the hollow? And for goodness sake, that's the best darn camera battery I've ever seen! If you want complex mythology to explain the nightmare, it's never really developed in any depth.For all that, though, \"Hollow\" is surprisingly well acted. What the screenplay lacks in horror, it makes up with some actual character development. The primary quartet are all quite believable. Emily Plumtree, Sam Stockman, Matt Stokoe, and Jessica Ellerby play the four leads. As the stress of the weekend starts to divide them, each turns in a performance that was more convincing that I had anticipated. Seriously, I think they all have the potential to go on to bigger projects. As much as I want to recommend \"Hollow\" for this reason, though, I'm still unable. The back story is both derivative and only vaguely explored. And in a movie that is trying to ratchet up the tension, this is a fatal mistake. I'd personally be happy if I never saw another \"found footage\" thriller. Too often, the genre lends itself to sloppy storytelling. Performances at 4 stars, plot at 2 stars, scares at 1 1/2 stars. The DVD/Blu-ray packaging might convince you that this is a horror story, but it's really a piece about relationships under duress. KGHarris, 2/13."
B009CPIQQE I liked the story about the tree. The strange happenings were creepy and even though I expected some supernatural outcome the ending was feasible."
B009CPIQQE So, I like the combo pack distribution method. You get both the Blu & the DVD in one simple package. Good stuff.It comes with basically one special feature, an AMEX sponsored \"behind the scenes\" featurette. Other than that' it's just the movie, and maybe a few trailers for other movies.That said, the movie itself was pretty middlin'. Not great, not terrible. But, in the end it really didn't amount to anything. Backstory was vaguely interesting. Supposedly some evil things dwells in a hollow tree and causes people to commit suicide, or something?You never actually see the supposed \"thing.\" As with so many \"found footage\" films, it's just a bunch of people running around screaming about things you never actually. But it's in the dark so it's a little creepy. You keep expecting something to jump out of the dark and go \"Boo!\" Sadly, the only thing going \"Boooo...\" is the audience. Nothing ever really happens... The backstory isn't ever entirely explained, the characters are kind of boring. There are lots of shots of nothing. Like watching the windshield wipers, or pointing the camera at seagulls, or pointing the camera at the ground while walking (or running screaming). There seem to be a number of \"cinematic transitions\" that have no real explanation within the bounds of \"how a handheld camera works.\" So, either the 'police' 'edited' the video to make it more interesting, or well obviously it's a 'movie.'In the end, there was just too little going on, too many scenes of nothing interesting going on and no explanation for everything that happened and you never actually SEE anything scary it's all just the psychological terror of running around in the dark and THINKING you MIGHT see something scary.Can't really recommend this over any other 'found footage' flicks. It's moody / atmospheric, if only 'cause portions of it at filmed in the dark. Otherwise? Not a whole lot going for it.I'd rather recommend watching the originalBlair Witch Project, theParanormal Activityseries, or a personal favorite,Grave Encounters, which actually gives you the creepy visual stuff so many others are lacking..."
B009CPIQQE Hollow (Michael Axelgaard, 2011)Sometimes, during those brief moments of lucidity when my head clears a little and I can step back from the Netflix Instant queue, I ask myself why it is I continue to watch movies in subgenres that were played out before they even got popular. I never come up with a good answer to the question (and I'm never lucid long enough to go digging, really). Case in point: the found-footage film, an offpsring of the mockumentary that is, ultimately, an offshoot of the popularity of 1999's The Blair Witch Project. I've seen maybe a half-dozen found-footage films I would consider watching a second time; I've seen maybe one hundred found footage fil
B009CPIQQE This is one of the worst foreign films of the year in my opinion. Definitely skip it cause there are much better ones out there to be viewed."
B009CPIQQE It was a good spooky movie.  I saw that some of the reviews weren't very good, but I thought the movie was great.  Lots of atmosphere, and I even shut my eyes a few times.  It is not a slash and gash and is nothing like Blair Witch which I unfortunately paid money to see.  If your expecting a bloody horror kill fest this movie is not for you.  If you want to feel scared of things that go bump in the night, this is the movie for that!  I guess the word for this movie is unnerving..."
B009CZ4QMW I was happy with this pilot.  Clearly, the doctor has a lot of history with the mob to sort out, all the way back to her dad.If it's handled well, this could make for a very interesting season.  I look forward to finding out.The pace of the pilot was a little frantic, but there's always so much to cram into the first hour of a show, so it's to be expected."
B009CZ4QMW Good story and good actors. The main actress is reasonably hot - which makes up for the reality gaps when it comes to the scenes in the hospital. So it has all the ingredients for a successful show. Not sure what all the complaining is about. They even gonna cancel it and going backward and forward about when. Hopefully they stick to the full season with all 13 shows."
B009CZ4QMW This is one good show. It is interesting in its story as well as well written and well acted. The Chicago mob types are quite real..almost as real as Sopranos guys!! I cannot believe that Fox cancelled. I do recommend that it be bought even for the one season - its good and the story does wrap up and does not leave the viewer hanging as do so many other cancellations. Carol T"
B009CZ4QMW From Josh Berman (\"Bones\", \"Drop Dead Diva\", \"Vanished\") and Rob Wright (\"Charmed\", \"Walker, Texas Ranger\", \"The Magnificent Seven\") comes the medical drama series \"The Mob Doctor\" which premiered in September 2012 and finished in January 2013.The FOX series starred Jordana Spiro (\"My Boys\", \"Trespass\", \"Must Love Dogs\"), William Forsythe (\"The Rock\", \"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"The Devil's Rejects\"), James Carpinello (\"The Punisher\", \"Gangster Squad\"), Zach Gilfrod (\"Friday Night Lights\", \"The River Why\"), Zeljko Ivanek (\"Donnie Brasco\", \"Argo\", \"Hannibal\") and Jaime Lee Kirchner (\"Mercy\", \"Carlito's Way: Rise to Power\").\"The Mob Doctor\" revolves around Grace Devlin (portrayed by Jordana Spiro), a surgical resident who is trying to protect her brother Nate (portrayed by Jesse Lee Soffer) from being killed by mobster Paul Moretti (portrayed by Michael Rapaport), unless Grace does one job and that is to kill a man that has entered the hospital that Moretti wants dead.Grace meanwhile is helping out a mobster named Constantine Alexander, who was released from prison and has been a father figure to the family since her husband was father (who worked with Constantine) long ago.  Working for Constantine is Grace's ex-boyfriend Franco Leoni (portrayed by James Carpinello).But Grace is currently dating Dr. Brett Robinson (portrayed by Zach Gilford) and although she despised her father (who was always drunk and hurt the family), she has wanted to know who killed her father.When Grace decides not to help Moretti, Moretti comes after Grace's brother but when he's not at home, he threatens to kill her mother.  This leads to a confrontation between Grace and Moretti in which a car chase leads to Constantine's home.  When Constantine tells his former subordinate to drop his gun, he starts telling Moretti how he's nothing and he should shut his mouth.Constantine shoots Moretti and this gives new life to the former criminal who realizes, being a mobster is the life he enjoyed and now he has come out of retirement.He tells Grace that if the family leaves town, her family is safe.  Otherwise, if she stays, she must continue to honor the deal with Moretti, which has now transferred to him.Grace agrees to do Constantine jobs as in helping mobsters in hiding or people of interest who require a doctor.  As for Nate, he doesn't like the fact that his sister has to do these jobs for Constantine, so he begins working for him.Meanwhile, Grace's relationship with Constantine is strained when he finds herself having to help out criminals.But as things seem to be going OK, what Constantine doesn't know is Paul Moretti is still alive (and is helped out by Franco) and now Moretti wants revenge.VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"The Mob Doctor: The Complete Series\" is presented in 1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital. Picture quality is good for what one can expect on DVD. Lighting is well-done and for the most part, most viewers will be pleased with the picture quality of the series on DVD. As for the audio, the series is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1. Dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"The Mob Doctor: The Complete Series\" comes with no special features.JUDGMENT CALL:We have seen many medical shows on television and today, they continue to be popular.But how can one created a medical drama series but not be considered another copycat?  Josh Berman and Rob Wright decided to throw a crime element and what if a doctor must secretly provide medical services to a mobster.While the concept was rather intriguing, the fact that the series revolves around a major mobster having to call a doctor for medical services, does get a bit overboard.Fortunately, the series is interesting in the fact that the main protagonist, Grace is not so thrilled about working with the mob and having to be under mobster Constantine's beck and call.Keeping her illegal medical services secret and trying to have a normal livelihood with boyfriend Brett, meanwhile her brother Nate is getting deeper involved with a crime family, her ex-fiance Franco is working for two mobsters who want each other dead and with so much going on in the criminal world, she's busy as it is at work.  Trying to be the best doctor and trying to solve intriguing medical cases (as her fellow doctors are doing as well).Meanwhile, you have one mobster who is thought to be dead, is very much alive and is trying to kill the mobster and all mobsters who have crossed him.There is no doubt some fascinating twist and turns in this drama series but unfortunately, viewers are not going to get any more episodes of the series as FOX had cancelled it three months after the series premiere.  The series was panned by critics and due to the plain title that turned people off and a storyline that combined the underworld of criminal organizations and a surgical resident, it was not exactly winning over viewers.  And it didn't help that a month into the show's release, the cast were not even sure why the show wasn't cancelled yet. (Note: It was reported that FOX refused to cancel \"Mob Doctor\" because the network only featured three new shows and waited for the other networks to cancel a new show first.)But at least FOX let the show complete its 13-episode run unlike some shows that are just canceled with no closure for fans.Granted, writers were able to end the series with the final episode but it seemed as if it was a tacked on ending just to complete the series.  Grace had been portrayed as a moralistic character and the final actions were not what I expected of her.  But there had to be an ending to give closure to fans of the series.\"The Mob Doctor\" was not a bad series, in fact, I was entertained by it.  It's just that for a medical drama series, it focused solely on Grace Devlin and very little on its supporting cast.  With most medical dramas, they tend to rely on its ensemble cast and various storylines that revolve around them.  With \"The Mob Doctor\", too much was focused around Grace and with most surgical residents very busy, it was just hard to see this character always off doing underground medical services and trying to coverup illegal activities at the hospital.Overall, \"The Mob Doctor\" is for those who enjoyed the series or people looking for a short 13-episode drama series that combines medical drama and the mob underground.  It's not terrible but the series does get entertaining at times and may be worth someones time."
B009CZ4QMW Fox has really had a problem with their Monday at 9PM timeslot since \"24\" concluded.  First they cancelled the excellent \"Chicago Code.\"  Then they cancelled \"Terra Nova\" just as it was showing improvement.  Now this excellent series.The show is a nice combination of a medical series and gangster drama.  Dr. Grace Devlin an ER doctor at a Chicago hospital owes a favor to gangster Constantine and must come running whenever he calls.  Jordana Spiro, a very pretty and excellent actress plays Grace and she is very enjoyable to watch.  William Forsythe, who during the 1990s played Al Capone on a two season reboot of \"The Untouchables\" plays gang boss Constantine.  Half-way through the season, Jennifer Beals comes on board for a few episodes as a female mob boss.  (Beals just keeps getting better looking with age.)Anyway, this excellent series was DOA on Fox.  I would tell friends how good it was and most never heard of it.  I watched every episode and don't think that there was one dud.Well, the Producers obviously knew that the show was finished after its initial thirteen episodes.  So they finished the entire series off in a very logical and satisfying way.  Thats why I highly recommend this set.  You will be seeing an excellent series and know that it will have a satisfying conclusion, not a cliff hanger.If you missed this series (like most of my friends,) I cannot recommend this series enough: a well-written and interesting concept and the eminently watchable Miss Spiro.  Highly recommended."
B009CZ4QMW It just isn't close to life..She is running around like a chicken a real Doctor doesn't do that...I don't know just could get into the show that much. Mobs and medicine is one of my favorite you see I'm a movie buff..."
B009CZ4QMW I love this show so much I purchased the entire season. The sad thing is the network cancelled it. I can't believe that such a great show too. They keep the stupid ones on air. Go figure. The quantity all around was very good."
B009CZ4QMW Fox accepting this series is a total waste. Another medical drama mixed with espionage and a female lead taking over and stuff (boring), yet I am glad it received a proper series finale."
B009CZ4QMW NO SPOILERS:UPDATE 1/7/13:Having (sadly) just concluded watching the series finale, I feel compelled to update my rating from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2.  The series got progressively better.  I watched the last 4-episodes back-to-back to.  The \"majors\" seem unwilling to give a program a chance to build an audience, which is a shame here.  If you have not watched in real time, watch on video.I generally don't gravitate toward medical dramas, though organized crime is another matter altogether.  So it would be fair to say that \"you had me at Mob!\"  The second word \"Doctor\" was almost inconsequential.  Also, the new Direct TV DVR allows the recording of 5-programs simultaneously with 800-hours of storage capacity.The show stars:\"My Boys\" Actress Jordana Spiro (Grace) is a Chicago \"South-sider\" made good. Her on-the-books job is that of a hospital Resident.  Grace also moonlights for the the mob, as pennance for her brother's debtsWilliam Forsythe (Constantine) who is no stranger to playing mob roles, is an \"OG\" and seemingly retired mob boss who is recently released from prisonMichael Rapaport (Moretti) took over Constantine's turf when he went to prison and is holding Grace hostage to her brother's debtsWhat kept me interested through the first 3-episodes are all the dynamics at play:1.) Grace juggling life as an Resident with working for Moretti.  She also has a Doctor boyfriend, though may have feelings for her Ex who is a mob enforcer and right hand man to Moretti.  There is an on-going competition with another Resident that has hospital connections and her constant moral dilima re: how far she is willing to go.  And then there are the frequent flashbacks to her less than pleasant childhood2.) Constantine wanting to take back what Moretti has3.) Moretti wanting to retain control4.) Grace's Ex in the middle\"Mob Doctor\" is different than anything that is currently on network TV and the pilot opened to \"so-so\" numbers.  However, each of the following 2-episodes have fallen to a ratings level that generally spells cancellation"
B009CZ4QMW Good Characters, Great Stories in a Great City. Good writing and lots of fun. 5 stars easily. To me i cant see how anyone would give it less than 4."
B009CZ4QMW The concept of the show...that the doctor has to compromise her principles by doing jobs for the mob to protect her brother just didn't work.  I can't imagine week after week is not my cup of tea."
B009CZ4QMW As usual, I find a good show I like and it gets cancelled! Good show! There's just something about mafia movies. All the tough talking guys!"
B009D4PG62 actually, the beginning of prom, already shipping water (why is it that the rest of the planet is unaware of the cool cave paintings, why was there no debate about the wisdom of unleashing an expedition into deep space, with such slight consideration of consequences, why wasn't the crew prepped for at least months prior to takeoff, instead of receiving a 15 minute briefing after arrival, and where is the rest of the goddamned crew?  ad nauseum.  still, it was about the only coherent segment of the thing, and seemed promising, even after excusing the instantaneous fast forward from cave to space...a VERY bad sign.  when this prick tease of a film wasn't straining itself disfigured to \"strand\" in alien elements (obviously, in order to pull in the same alien fanboys who will never stop insisting this debacle was a perfected meisterwerk...oh, yes, and to jam theatres with them), it was failing incessantly to either develop characters or sustain logic. already forced to forgive a lame beginning, i was entirely unable to locate a coherent middle or ending of a film that had been ridleyed to death with (here it comes) plot holes, and meaningless \"clues\", a la lindelof.  no story, no logic, no thanks.  i see he has actually made an emblem of the one serious mar he forced upon bladerunner, which would be the assinine intercalation of the unicorn puzzle dream.  once again, deckard's partner could have shared an interest in them for far too many reasons.  \"take that, you vulgarian fools!\" would be the meaning of that pathetic gesture, so very characteristic of ridley in a snit.  fine.  take THIS, you pompous twit: i couldn't care less where this doomed attempt to force meaning on prom I leads.  been lead down that path one too many times.  even for an egomaniac, did you really think i would be willing to WAIT for a story to happen, one movie too late?  you keep it."
B009D4PG62 Very disappointing in the movie now. Plenty of great effects but not a great story or acting or anything. Just thought it would be much better."
B009D4PG62 Gets you curious which is all it is designed to do, I actually watched this after the feature which I really enjoyed"
B009D4PG62 while I think the kicker at the end of the movie is kinda our comeuppance Ridley Scott yeilded to the out cry or outrage for a prequel"
B009D4PG62 Some people did not like the Prometheus but I have watched this several times. Sure, I want more storyline, background etc. but this is a great prequel."
B009DB82WK This is a new take on the old version 10 days instead of 7 ..all alone, no camera crew juwst les stroud and his knnowledge of survival entertaining and informative 2 blades up"
B009DB82WK This season is VERY short--only 4 episodes--but Les rocks! I was so bummed when the original show went off the air, and thrilled to find this!"
B009DB82WK Some very minor spoilers ahead !!!I like the fact that the shows are longer, but seems to me like he spent more time on writing poetry than showing us survival skills, details, and maybe detailed advice from his own experience, talking about the gear, instead he makes sure his speach sounds poetic. Also I know from past shows that he does usually have a satellite phone with him, when he does these things, I dont know if thats still the case( probably is, condsidering he has a family) which is not that big of a deal, especially considering that \"Bear Grylls\" guy, who has like 5 people with him giving him food, and he only surives in places that are within a walking distance of a hotel.Now granted this guy kind of cheats too, cause what they do is they pickout a place, survey the land, and then talk to a local surival expert of sorts, who tells them which weeds are edible, and which animals are in season, etc.... in a real surival situation how in the hell would you know if you can eat the sea weeds, what frogs are poisinous and what are not. Thats kind of not real surival if you got a phone,(whether or not he actaully uses it in the ten day period or not, its still there) part of being in a surival situation is being scared shi**less, knowing that you have absultely NO contact with the outside world. You have NO idea about local weeds, or animals, or possible shelter, much different than having surveyed the land with an expert before hand.You can see the scared look on his face when hes walking down the cliff and screws up, you can tell he was scared for real, his heart was pounding on camera, thats the kind of feeling you get in a real situation, as a matter of fact he even said it himself at the end of the show. Also just like the previous shows, this whole show is preplaned for him to go to a specific location so his extraction team can come get him. At the end when he tried to make signal fire, you can tell the extraction team knew exactly where he was, whereas in a real surival situation he would be Shi**ng up the creek without flares or something,...B
B009DB82WK We love this show. Sorry it didn't continue. Wish it was free, but worth 1.99. If you like this show try Dual Survivors."
B009DB82WK My only wish is that they could release the season's episodes faster.  The wait is far too long between episode releases."
B009DB8UFY My 3 and 4 year olds love it!  Great that there are so many seasons of it here!  Not our old Mickey though..."
B009DB8UFY My 6 month baby girl loves to watch this tv show, and also I like it because they teach her some value things."
B009DB8UFY Toddler loves this show, He claps and tries to copy what they say and do, entertaining with all the Disney character everyone loves, wish there was more learning tools involved though. Maybe for older toddlers"
B009DB8UFY My kids love Mickey Mouse and I love the characters, and the lessons it sneaks in. Just don't like watching it a million times a day lol"
B009DB8UFY My daughter, like all kids, loves Mickey and Clubhouse.  We watch it on her Kindle Fire HD and it's fine and plays fine."
B009DNVLH6 If you love Survivor then you will love this season. It is the same format that has been working for years."
B009DNVLH6 Great season! I'm a newcomer to Survivor and I love being able to see the seasons I missed. This season is the first with Russell, I've seen him before on a later season, but had no idea what a great player he was until I watched this season. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to buying more seasons as they become available."
B009DNVLH6 I love every season of Survivor.  It is nice to be able to rewatch old seasons while waiting for the next new one to begin!"
B009DNVLH6 Russell Hantz is the king of survivor. He is the best strategic player the game has ever seen. Without anyone knowing he threw socks in the fire, and poured out water bottles. He even lied about being in Hurricane Katrina. It's crazy that you still root for him even after he does all these things. He is the king of the hidden immunity idol and finds three in the game without any clues. He convinces people to flip alliances and is responsible for 80% of the people voted out of the game. He tries to create an alliance with every one and figures out who is on his side and who isn't. If you threaten Russell you got to go. Russell may be the reason his team loses every challenge because he sabotages the camp. He doesn't need the numbers at a merge because of his master manipulation. A lot of people in the game only get showed 2-3 times talking the entire game because Russell is much more interesting and he's got a lot to say. Buy this season if you are a fan of survivor."
B009DNVLH6 I LOVED ALL THE SURIVIOR SEASONS."
B009DNVLQW I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THIS PROGRAM.  I LOVE TO SEE THE CAST TRY AND WORK THINGS OUT."
B009DNVLQW I have been a fan of the show for years and would watch any of the seasons. This one is just as good as the rest."
B009DNVLQW I enjoyed this season from beginning to end. I'm a big Survivor fan and this is easily one of my favorite seasons. Very entertaining."
B009DNVLQW Just look at the cast and see for yourself how many Survivor bad asses they got for this season. You know it is gonna be good for that reason alone. I highly recommend that you watch past seasons of survivor before watching this one. Having familiarity with the characters is crucial to your enjoyment, plus they will give away spoilers to past seasons outcomes in this one. It does not go down as my favorite season ever probably for selfish reasons, some of my favorite characters were ousted earlier than I would have liked and some of my least favorites advanced on."
B009DNVLQW To be fair I'm not even quite at the merge yet.  What a great beginning and premise!  Many of my old favorites as well as some I wonder why in the world the producers would ever invite them back.  Then my favorites (villians and heroes) bite the dust and increasingly what's left is becoming drudgery to watch.  The intense narcissism that pervades so many of this crew (and some of every season)--not the least of which is Russell and Coach--is annoying and I wish Survivor directors would delete those displays of psychopathology and focus in on, well, anything else.  Breaking out of the predictable formula more is also a recommendation.  And the locale?  Some unnamed Pacific island, I guess. Same-0, same-0.  Come on, try something new and unique--like the Green Mountains in Vermont or the Appalachian Trail.  Of course, that means the participants will be dressed and not showing off their sometimes disturbing assortment of swimsuited bodies--but that formula has become stale and numbing.  Anyway, it is fine entertainment and I keep watching, so there is appeal."
B009EGGA3M Actually that's a pretty good comedy with a good set of actors. A little unbelievable, but fun none the less. Recommended."
B009EGGA3M This is a quirky movie but it is delightful in it's attempts at slap stick humor.  It is not my normal movie to watch but I appreciate some of the leads. They did a good job. It is family friendly, for the most part, and just a fun show to watch and enjoy without having to mental engage to much."
B009EGGA3M I loved this movie! I'm a huge fan of Katherine McPhee, this movie was great with drama and also had it's fair share of funny moments."
B009EGGA3M This is a kind of dumb, lightly entertaining movie with two mis-cast leading actors.  He does not match her in any way and imagining them fall in love is just creepy.  Sorry, it wasn't the best movie, but I didn't turn it off so I gave it a three."
B009EGGA3M Brian Lighthouse (Dave Annable) photographs pets in clothes for a living. His new assistant Tonya (Mena Suvari) is sexy, playful and is in love with Brian who for some reason avoids her advances. Through some poorly scripted circumstances Brian finds himself in a position where he must marry Masha (Katharine McPhee) the daughter of a crime boss (Ken Davitian) in order for her to obtain her green card. After a year, the marriage will be annulled and she will then marry the overly jealous Vinnie Jones. Dad and Vinnie forbid consummating the relationship, even as they honeymoon in Tahiti.Brian's under utilized mom (Kathy Bates) offers little in the way of helpful advice as she is a stay at home mom. The poorly conceived plot drags along and then at about 45 minutes into the film, we get the twist and the movie becomes a watchable comedy, formula and all. This will work as a date night film and perhaps a teen family night. Mena \"Kitten\" Suvari steals all the scenes. Her part was written better than Katharine McPhee.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some sexual double entendre."
B009EGGA3M This is a fun, cute movie- blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
B009F11B7Q Even though it is a short one (13 episodes) it was a good series. Kept you on your toes throughout, wondering what would happen. and It ended well"
B009F11B7Q Time constraints being what they are, a forty five minute episode doesn't allow too much for character development. Look beyond that, though and elements of plot for this show are developed at a level which invite comparison with the various types of gasoline you can buy at the pump. There's regular, unleaded and then there's super. Plot wise,  last resort seems to consistently be of the super variety, the octane of which is of the highest combustibility. Starting from the opening scene of a damaged Seal crew racing across the &#34;Indian&#34; ocean in search of rescue, only to be unwittingly pushed up out the water by the rescuing nuclear submarine, the plot  quickens from there. The writers found a thread allowing  consistently solid plot developments, each carefully calculated to escalate the tension  further, while maintaining the integrity of the  plot. Sort of like the most combustible of gasoline varieties with a high flammability point, allowing  consistent, powerful explosions to provide the best mileage. As for the acting, the directors on the show betray an intimate knowledge of stagecraft, rarely allowing pat allusions to degrade the nobility of the emotions the characters are seeking to portray. All in all some of the most invigorating  and dynamic tv out there."
B009F11B7Q Bought this for my husband. And he watches it as soon as a new episode pops up. If he's happy then I'm happy!"
B009F11B7Q I just saw the last episode of this series just a few minutes ago. I am hoping the DVD is coming out soon. It is too good for TV. This series in a way is like the mini series of old. I watched all the previous episodes on demand today.It was amazing rideAndre Braugher is amazing  as Marcus Chaplin, the captain of the nuclear submarine Colorado. He and his second in command Sam Kendal (Scott Speedman)  are told to do a nuclear strike from an unsecured line. When asking for repeat conformation, his sub is fired on by another US submarine. It has overtones of Fail Safe with all the political intrigue. The tensions is high & powerful. It does not let up until the final episode...and still there is air of mystery at the end. You wonder who is a friend and who is a traitor, both in the crew of the Colorado and in Washington DC.The supporting cast including Daisy Betts, Robert Patrick, Jessy Schram and Sahr Ngaujah who adds to this piece so well. It is not a star vehicle for any actor. It is a character study drawn over 13 episodes. There are no weak performancesIn a way, I am glad this show lasted only 13 episodes, it was complete. Loose ends were tightly tighten and it works. I do not think this show should have gone further than this 13 episode arc...it began and ended!  It is filling and leaves you wanting more..isnt that would a good series is all about.I will say this, this show is better thanMissing: The Complete First Seasonever wasBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD"
B009F11B7Q Like most other reviews here I loved the premiere, but every episode since has just gotten worse.This last episode \"Another Fine Navy Day\" was the worst yet. Seemed to me it was more like a stalling tactic - that the writers didn't know where to take the show - so they just drugged everyone and we have to sit through 45 minutes of stupid hallucinations that simply annoyed me. I found myself fast forewarding through parts I was so disappointed.The writers had better get on the ball with the next episode or risk losing more and more viewers."
B009F11B7Q Uh ... the \"stuff\" is not moving along very fast .... I am getting a little bored at all these stalling tactics, get on with it."
B009F11B7Q first, i could watch anything with Andre Braugher in it.  he was abaolutely wonderful in the latest ray romano vehicle about three middle aged friends.  i was sad when that show was cancelled as he had done a brilliant job as the son taking over the family business, he plays the captain of the nuclear sub here. however, i am worried about some of the rest of the casting, there is a huge remaining cast which seems to have been primarily picked for looks over talent, especially all of the women in the cast. Andre Braugher going head to head with ray romano is one thing.  his being stranded on a tropical isle with a cast which looks straight outof a lifeguard show is quite another.the premise is interesting but sticks us with this huge cast on a tropical isle. essentially, a US nuclear sub goes rogue with Andre Braugher at the helm. it is now at war with the US and is located with 17 nuclear warheads on an island formerly occupied by NATO. the ship went rogue when it received a possibly bogus attack order to annhilate pakistan.this show could go either way but it needs a fast infusion of other first rate acting talent."
B009F11B7Q As I write this review I have only watched a few of the freebee pilots and I am amazed at the fantastic quality of this series. I am looking forward  to continuing to watch the rest of the season and hope there will be a season 2. Oh, by the way, did anyone else notice that the landscape is the same as the series \"LOST?\""
B009F11B7Q Action and drama. The shows gives you a great balance of both. Amstrad Baumgaedner steals the show. His acting is top notch."
B009F11B7Q If you want a roller coaster ride of strained loyalties, enemies at every corner, deception and backstabbing with fierce loyalty and devoton to duty...watch LAST RESORT!First episode, a misslile strike order, cruise missile attack on a submarine and a nuclear detonation and this show is JUST GETTING STARTED!"
B009F11B7Q From creators Shawn Ryan (\"The Shield\", \"Welcome to Hollywood\", \"The Unit\") and Karl Gajdusek (\"Oblivion\", \"Trespass\") comes \"Last Resort\", an American military drama which aired on ABC from September 2012 to January 2013.The series would star Andre Braugher (\"Homicide: Life on the Street\", \"The Mist\", \"City of Angels\"), Scott Speedman (\"Underworld\" films, \"Felicity\"), Australian actress Daisy Betts (\"Shutter\", \"Caught Inside\", \"Persons Unknown\"), French actress Camille De Pazzis (\"Le Premier Jour: Du Reste De Ta Vie\", Quand j'etais chanteur\"), Dichen Lachman (\"Dollhouse\", \"Neighbours\", \"Aquamarine\"), Daniel Lissing (\"Crownies\"), Sahr Ngaujah (\"The Signal\", \"Stomp the Yard\"), Autumn Reeser (\"The Girl Next Door\", \"The O.C.\", \"No Ordinary Family\"), Jessy Schram (\"Unstoppable\", \"American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile\") and Robert Patrick (\"Terminator 2&#8243;, \"The Unit\", \"Walk the Line\").While the premiere of \"Last Resort\" brought in over 9 million viewers, due to drop in viewership, ABC decided not to take on a full season but did air the 13 episodes that were created, including a season finale which would give fans closure.And now \"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" will be released on DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\"Last Resort\" revolves around the crew of the U.S. Navy Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, the USS Colorado.  The crew led by Commanding Officer Marcus Chaplin (portrayed by Andre Braugher) and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal (portrayed by Scott Speedman) pick up a U.S. Navy SEAL team off Pakistan's coast.While everything is going perfectly fine inside the USS Colorado, Lt. Grace Shepard (portrayed by Daisy Betts) receives an encoded message to launch nuclear ballistic missiles at Pakistan.But because a nuclear missiles on a country would kill millions and the fact the message came from a channel that would only be used only if the White House was destroyed, as Chaplin checks on American news, there is no mention of any problems in the United States.  So, Chaplin asks for confirmation from the U.S. government of why the order did not come in proper channels.Unfortunately, some of Chaplin's crew such as Commander Master Chief Petty Officer Joseph Prosser (portrayed by Robert Patrick) and others  question their Commanding Officer for not following direct orders to launch the nuclear missiles.Immediately, the Deputy Secretary of Defense William Curry dismisses Captain Marcus Chaplin for refusing to follow orders and Lt. Commander Sam Kendal is made acting captain. But before they launch the nuclear missiles, Kendal also requests the order to come in through proper channels.  Because of his refusal, an American tomohawk shot by the USS Illinois is sent to destroy the USS Colorado.While the USS Colorado is hit and there are a few casualties, the crew try to question why they were fired upon.  Meanwhile at the island of Sainte Marina, NATO is observing the tomohawk missile and seeing American government reporting it as missile attack by Pakistan.  In retaliation, the U.S. shoots two nuclear missiles on Pakistan.As America reports that the USS Colorado has been sunk by Pakistan, the USS Colorado rises underwater and the crew take over the Sainte Marina.  When they find out from NATO's Sophie Girard (portrayed by Camille De Pazzis) that it was the USS Illinois that attacked them, both Speedman and Chaplin are shocked.  To make things even worse, the government using other channels to communicate with other members of the crew try to get them to eliminate both Speedman and Chaplin.Knowing that their duty is to protect their crew and serve the United States, they record a video featuring Chaplin about how their intention is to protect the crew of the USS Colorado but because America tried to kill them, any country that tries to get near the perimeter near the island will be treated as the enemy.  And because there are 17 nuclear missiles, they will be used against any aggressor.So, as the USS Colorado makes Sainte Marina their main base, they must deal with the island natives who are not happy with the crew being on their island, they must deal with other countries trying to gain possession of the submarine (for its nuclear missiles) but also crew who are receiving messages from the government to eliminate Speedman and Chaplin for treason.  As the crew of the USS Colorado are also treated as criminals, Speedman and Chaplin must also deal with descending morale.Meanwhile, back in the U.S., Sam Kendal's wife Christine (portrayed by Jessy Schram) is being used by the government to get to Sam, meanwhile Kylie Sinclair (portrayed by Autumn Reeser) is trying to get information about the Perseus technology that is on the USS Colorado, a technology that she and her family built.  She knows from her govt. sources that the USS Illinois shot the Tomohawks and the USS Colorado and the USS government is involved.  But because of her knowledge, the U.S. government is watching closely over her, and worried she may be causing problems.With these growing problems, what will happen to the crew of USS Colorado?  And will they prove their innocence.VIDEO & AUDIO:\"Last Resort\" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 169 televisions. This is one of the few drama series on television where a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors, to there is good natural lighting and the series does look good on DVD. I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the series looks very good on DVD.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music and special effects always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. Did notice really good surround sound use for \"Last Resort\" with surround channels and rear surround channels being used.The show is presented in English SDH, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" includes the following special features:Making the Pilot - (4:18) A featurette on the making of the pilot.Profiles in Courage - (4:39) A featurette on the characters of \"Last Resort\" with interviews with cast and executive producers.Conn Artists - (4:29) The artists and production designer Jim Spencer and set designer Brenda Meyers-Ballard) talk about the conn room inside the submarine and how they design and built it.Anatomy of An Episode: Voluntold - (4:50) Behind-the-scenes of the making of the fourth episode \"Voluntold\" featuring director Stephen DePaul, Jessy Schram, Jay Hernandez, Andre Braugher and more.Grace Under Fire - (4:48) Dais Betts (Lt.

Who can imagine the Commanding Officer of shooting a nuclear missile near the White House?  Who can imagine how far a corrupt government would go?Yes, this is nothing new.  We have seen similar situations in dramas such as \"24&#8243;, we have seen betrayal of military members in films such as \"Platoon\", but what makes \"Last Resort\" so interesting is that it has never been done before.  A submarine carrying nuclear missiles and its crew landing in an island and literally taking it over.  An island where a drug runner has ruled hand over fist, a crew that is torn by its duty for the military without asking questions and a crew that is moralistic and would not nuke any country without a reason through proper channels.Throw in a cast of people who have their positives and negatives and you wonder how they will change, if they do change, throughout the series.Captain Marcus Chaplin, the honorable Captain who honors his country but also protects his submarine and its crew.  XO Sam Kendal, a man with honor but also a man who has been trying to find himself and possibly giving up too much of himself to the military, rather than to his wife.  Lt. Grace Shepard, the admiral's daughter but a woman who wants to prove that she got her position because of her skills and experience, not due to nepotism.Throw in characters such as the Navy SEAL James King, who he and his men are hiding the truth of what their mission was before being picked up by the USS Colorado.  Sophie Girard of NATO who has her obligations to her work but finds herself falling for XO Sam Kendal.Meanwhile at home, Kylie Sinclair tries to expose the truth about the government's lies, about a corrupt president and depending on Christine Kendal, wife of Sam, to bring out the truth of what happened to the US Colorado.And so many other characters that impact a storyline, similar to a series like \"LOST\", which may have many characters but yet, are utilized when the storyline is needed.There are so many things that could have gone wrong with \"Last Resort\" but the writing and the characters kept you coming back for more.  With that being said, it also comes down to one with an open mind, to accept things that may be farfetched or crazy.I can see some being turned off by how the series portrays a corrupt United States government.  How some may be turned off by military taking things into their own hands.  And perhaps the many characters and episode after episode of uncertainty.  Who is good?  Who is bad?  Will this crew member turn on you?  Or will the drug runners or the island natives end your life?It's not a simple series nor is the storyline simple...it features a complex conspiracy that tends to manifest until the final episode which the writers had to create closure and for the most part, they did.The series also has solid talent.  Andre Braugher does a magnificent job of playing Captain Marcus Chaplin and to see how his character evolves from beginning to end.  For Scott Speedman, it's good to see him play a role outside of \"The Underworld\" half Lycan/half vampire character or the problematic character on \"Felicity\" that he had previously been known for.Also, to see Autumn Reeser in another solid role, much different from the role that she was known for on \"The O.C.\".  And it's great to see international talents such as Australian actress Daisy Betts as Lt. Grace Shepard and French actress Camille De Pazzis as Sophie Girard.As for the DVD, \"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" features good picture quality on DVD with a good amount of shots done outdoors.  Also, a soundtrack that utilizes the surround channels quite frequently.  And there are also a good number of special features included on each of the three DVD's.Overall, I will give ABC the benefit of the doubt as I have seen many canceled series never receive any closure.  I'm glad the network gave \"Last Resort\" writers a chance to end the series, the best way they can.  It's an acceptable conclusion and so for anyone wanting a military drama that will be different than anything you have seen on television, a drama that is full of excitement and intrigue, then \"Last Resort: The Complete Series\" is a military drama worth watching!Recommended!"
B009F11B7Q If someone had told me a year ago that I'd be hooked on a submarine show, I would have told them with conviction that would never happen.  And, I would have been wrong: the acting, scripts, location, action, CG--can't think of anything I don't like."
B009F11B7Q A bit far fetched, but entertaining none the less. It shows how powerful people get what they want with a little help from Hollywood theatrics."
B009F11B7Q Good acting and most of all multilevel.  Stressing that the biggest conflict is over two sets of good guys and gals.  On one side the thoughtful patriots and on the other side the concerned patriots.  In this day of weapons capable of wiping out millions of people, strict protocols are absolutely necessary before these weapons are used.  It is ironic that the thoughful side based their decision in part upon the fact that these protocols were not \"strictly\" followed.  The concerned side says that we don't have to right to second guess orders as long as the protocols used were \"in the ball park.\"This was not developed to clearly, in future episodes the loop hole used by the good guys can be emphasized.  But the acting and directions are great."
B009F11B7Q Bad show. Not sure why this was made.  It is sort of like the book &#34;on the beach&#34; but not good. It was cancelled quick which should tell you all you need to know"
B009F11B7Q \"Last Resort\" is a decent show that, unfortunately, didn't rope in a lot of viewers, thus it was cancelled midway through its first season.  The creators of the show, however, advanced a bunch of storylines in the final episodes such that \"Last Resort\" played out like a TV miniseries.  So, if you happen to regard this show as something that leaves you hanging due to premature cancellation, guess again.The series involves a U.S. Navy submarine called the \"Colorado,\" which is given a suspicious order to nuke Pakistan, an order which its captain--well-played by Andre Braugher of \"Homicide\" fame--disobeys.  Pakistan then gets nuked anyway (by someone else).  The Colorado's captain and crew are then blamed for the nuclear strike and have to go rogue, stationing themselves on a South Pacific island while they attempt to determine who they can trust and what the truth is.All in all, a pretty good show.  While it didn't attain greatness, it was an enjoyable if short-lived ride.  Worth a look."
B009F11B7Q I have heard this show will be cancelled. This was disappointing news to say the least. I always looked forward to each new episode. The episodes flew by because the episodes were intense and left me wanting more. I do not know if the networks read our reviews on amazon. But personally I would rate this show as more than five stars. Maybe the network should try a different night to air this show to avoid cancellation. I wish they would gve it one more season and try another night."
B009F11B7Q LAST RESORT looks good on paper - a different storyline than the now dreary cop shows that keep morphing with new titles each season: Andre Braugher and Scott Speedman have certainly paid their dues and are very ready to be the leads in a series. Using a submarine as the base at first seems solid in concept (claustrophobic but in a way that allows it to be a microcosm of human behavior), but that sub can't stay submerged long enough. The story blisters into some flashbacks, pops open the lid of Washington DC in a not too unfamiliar manner (these days), and adds a very rapid new bas on a tropical islands where it seems that the crew plan to establish a new world, having been the victim of misguided US military tactics and potential in a nuclear war with Pakistan.The cast includes some female characters who seem to have a potential for becoming important figures in the story - the supporting cast includes Daisy Betts, Camille De Pazzis, Dichen Lachman, Daniel Lissing, Sahr Ngaujah, Autumn Reeser, Jessy Schram, Robert Patrick, Matt Gerald, Omid Abtahi, Max Adler, David Rees Snell, Michael Ng, Jessica Camacho, Will Rothhaar, Bruce Davison, Daniel Bess, Jodi Jarvis - but the show falls apart in the midst of all the commercial breaks that for once seem more interesting than the series itself. It all feels a bit silly.  Grady Harp, September 12"
B009F11B7Q The extreme hollywood portrayal of the likelihood that a submarine captain would go rogue armed with nuclear weapons. . ."
B009F11B7Q A tense and exciting show. We enjoyed it very much. Gives a lot of thought into what a government can and would do for its own benefit!"
B009F11B7Q I love this show ! such good acting, and story, it is a favorite already! Watch you will get hooked! I love the values these Men And Women stand on. stand by The show it rocks, hate to see another superb show be cancelled early, way better than those CSI, Law n order shows(too me). I hope you give it a shot like I, you will be glad that you did."
B009F11B7Q MINOR SPOILERS:So, within the first 15-minutes there is a Seal Team rescue by the submarine, the submarine crew dancing to \"La Bamba when they cross the equator, a back channels order to fire 4-missiles (which will kill 4.3 million people), the same sub having to dodge a \"Tomahawk\" missile and oh yea, the extremely hot and quite toned Autumn Reesner half naked in form fitting black lingerie straddling a Congressional Aide!The last time I was this excited about a network TV show (CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox), the year was 2001 and the show had 2-numbers in it's title (between 1 & 5)!Let us start with the excellent cast:Andre Braugher (most recently of \"Men of a Certain Age\" & \"Homicide\") - as Capt. Marcus ChaplinScott Speedman (Felicity and The Underworld Film Franchise) - as XO Sam KendalDaisy Betts (Australian \"Soap\" Actress) - as Lt. Grace Shepard(and a Rear Admiral daughter)Camille de Pazzis (French Actress and Face of Lancme) - as Sophie Gerard, French National and Head of the NATO Facility on Sainte MarinaDichen Lachman (Australian Actress, \"Dollhouse\") - as Tani Tumrenjack, Owner of Sainte Marina drinking establishmentAutumn Reesner (\"The OC, \"Entourage\" & \"Hawaii Five-O\") - as Kylie Sinclair, a lobbyist for her family's weapons manufacturing companyDaniel Lissing - as James King, Navy SEALSahr Ngaujah - as Julian Serrat, the local despotBraugher and Speedman bring the acting \"chops\", Reesner, Betts, Lachman & de Pazzis are sure to keep the male audience awake and ensure positive directional blood flow, while Lissing will appeal to female views.There is political intrigue, adaptation to their new island home and the dynamic of family relationships back in the USA.  There are so many interesting directions and plot lines that can be developed.  I have my fingers crossed that there is no dramatic fall off from the premier.  I don't know enough about subs and the workings of the military to point out inaccuracies, though I have to believe that poetic license has dictated that they will exist.  However, \"Last Resort\" in an 8:00 PM Thursday timeslot was such a pleasant surprise that I will continue to watch the episodes day of (as opposed to queuing up multiples on my DVR).YMMV, though IMHO, \"Last Resort\" is the only new premier major network *5 to date!"
B009F11B7Q Maybe too many subplots and questionable casting in a couple of cases, but it's the premise that interests me and keeps me watching to see where it goes."
B009F11B7Q I am really suprised after watching the first episode. I feel I am going to be hooked. I don't want to give away anything, but the acting is great, and t
B009F11B7Q This is definitley a thriller, Why is the United States waging war on Pakistan ?  The suspense is GREAT. Ihave enjoyed it from the first episode. I hope that there will be a second season. Andre Braugher is outstanding as is Robert Patrick. And all of the cast as well. Can't wait to see the entire season."
B009F11B7Q I love this show.  I like the way it protrays women in an important role.  The show is very exciting with lots of action."
B009F11B7Q WTH Writers? Are you trying to tank the series? This was actually a shocker series for me, episode one was a hit, the episodes after are typical but all still pretty good. And then.... \"Another Fine Navy Day\". In this episode we take action drama, adrenaline, guy show and cuddle it a little, make some very feminine slow, shocking day time soap opera drama. Maybe to attract more women? I am not sure, whatever it is, if you follow this with the same kind of trash, you will likely tank this series very quickly. It's as if the writers took a break and the overly effeminate romance novel day dreaming secretary got to change the pace and twists in the show. Sure it was going in the same direction, it isn't the story exactly that has changed, it is how it is being delivered. This episode was so bad. You were doing so well, don't do this again, or you will find it hard to get another season."
B009F11B7Q This was a great program. Loved it. Liked the story line, interesting characters. It is a shame it ended. Fun while it lasted."
B009F11B7Q Thus is the best show on ABC this season. I can't wait for it to start again in January. It is exciting a real nail bitter."
B009F11B7Q A big rave for our capable captain. Been watching him since \"Homicide,\" and he continues to amaze. Good ensemble with his crew although I'm having a hard time sorting out the many other characters on the island. Thought \"Men of a Certain Age\" was really good and sorry to see it go. Good ensemble piece, but nobody was watching."
B009F11B7Q Best new show of the season, one of the strongest pilots ive seen in quite some time, hope it stays great as season continues."
B009F11B7Q Great show, ending was very good, plots throughout was diverse enough for anyone's taste. Lots of action and  human interaction , Very good"
B009F11B7Q If you into drama with action this is a nice one with some twists and mystery.  Though something in the story seem a little off from what military would do.  Its fun to watch if you into military conspiracies and twists."
B009F11B7Q My DVR was acting up and I couldn't manage to record &#34;Last Resort&#34; when it aired, so I was pleased to discover I could get it at Amazon Prime.  As the title of my review says, it is a great concept, well-executed.  I was very disappointed to learn that ABC had already canceled it."
B009F11B7Q I have long been a fan of Shawn Ryan, Andre Branagher and Robert Patrick and the three together, in a show, makes for an interesting combination.the show \"last resort\" is a good show with a great story line. I am a huge fan of shows like MI-5, The Unit, The Shield, and many others, so this is up my alley, so to speak. The political structure storyline about the military industrial complex brings a great angle to a \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" story makes for an interesting premise. With addition of some aspects of \"Lost\" (a mysterious tropical isle off the grid) and a little \"24\" ( political intrigue with men of honor) I am hoping that this show will find it's home on thursday nights and not get cancelled.Do I like it? yes, very much so. Do i think it will find an audience? possible with the Xfiles people, the people that like shows like the aforementioned shows, yes. But TV audiences can be very fickle at times and sometimes the best of shows (Chicago Code comes to mind) can be the victim of bad scheduling. (really exactly how more years can we deal with reality based, talent based shows?) After all, Last Resort asks us to think, to comprehend and to watch not sit back and be passively entertained by overly dramatic, preening 20 somethings who want to be a star.give it a chance people, it's good, it's entertaining and thrilling...not sanjia with a bad hair day."
B009F11B7Q This is a pretty good show!  Fast paced, interesting, slightly original, solid writing.  What else do you need in entertainment?"
B009F11B7Q I was disappointed to learn ABC plans to drop the show. I would hope another network would consider it as it is entertaining and interesting to watch."
B009F11B7Q I was sorry to hear that ABC axed this one, I found it to have a good story, strong characters, and a great setting."
B009F6PNGQ I really liked this season but I was hoping for a different winner. Oh well it was still worth watching."
B009F6PNGQ The twists and turns that Survivor brings, the personalities and the strategy involved make Survivor a must see each and every season."
B009F6PNGQ This is a standout season for me for a few reasons. It has several excellent players with big personalities and one heck of a villain. Very entertaining! I love Survivor and really hope Amazon starts offering more seasons for Prime Members."
B009F6PNGQ Malcolm and Denise were the only people I rooted for. Malcolm is one of the 10 best players to ever play the game. The winner is deserving and goes to every single tribal council in the game. Lisa was pretty annoying and talked about God all the time. Lisa is a complete hypocrite and backstabs Malcolm twice. It's a joke that Lisa wins player of the year over Malcolm. Malcolm plays a good social game, he's good at challenges, he finds immunity idols. Lisa does none of this and all the religious people watching feel so bad for because she's so worthless and gets awarded player of the year. Abbie is an annoying villain who makes you think that Brazilians are crazy. Russell Swan is a big joke and he tries to be the leader of his tribe. Russell says he's not the leader than becomes a dictator. Michael Skupin is injury prone and shows you why he fell into the fire his first season. Jeff Kent is a complete DBag and tries to screw over people in his alliance. Penner is a great player and falls victim to not forming an alliance at the right time."
B009F6PNGQ Okay, I haven't finished the last episode of this season but am halfway through with it.  Overall the season has been satisfying if formulytic.  The challenges are impeccably planned, built, and tested.  I'm amazed by the engineering and construction work for these.  I would prefer some challenges that are &#34;outside the box&#34;--such as timed wilderness hikes using cues or GPS.  The characters are nicely varied with the &#34;love-to-hate&#34; usuals (like Abi) and the close favorites.  Jeff Probst manages to break out of his scripted role during tribal councils and engages nicely with contestants, but he needs to vary some of the predictable phrases (e.g., &#34;once again immunity is back up for grabs!&#34;).  Cimematography remains top-notch and sound-mixing is flat-out amazing.  Locations need a re-think, however, as the palm-tree beaches are getting redundant.  I assume these locations are chosen to best show off the contestant's bodies but something new would be a refreshing change--a wilderness camp in the New Hampshire or Rocky mountains?"
B009F6PNGQ I own all of the survivor series, can't live without it.keep them coming.It's one of the best reality shows ever made."
B009F7QE0E This show so far is continuing to please. Not a dull moment in Haven, Maine. Can't wait for Season 4."
B009F7QE0E I haven't seen Haven Seasons 1 and 2 so I can only speak towards Season 3. After doing some homework on Wikipedia, I could follow the story of Season 3 better. I found the whole mythology and the characters incredibly engaging and entertaining. I'm hooked."
B009F7QE0E I am very happy with the degree to which episodes of Haven, while standing alone, also manage to push t
B009F7QE0E Haven is a wonderful series.  The characters are engaging with personalities that range from humorous to super serious and everything in between.  We look forward to every show."
B009F7QE0E At the end of last season we were left with Audrey mysteriously abducted and the ambiguity of Duke's character split even further with the knowledge that he is meant to kill Audrey and that his gift/truble works by taking on the talents of others through exposure to their blood. But Duke swears that he isn't his father and means no harm to Audrey.Duke and Nathan team up to search for Audrey but they trust each other even less than usual and it seems another Haven woman has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, though her son believes that the evidence points to alien abduction. His grandfather was an alien abduction historian and taught the grandson everything he knows.Sorting out the aliens from the troubled and finding Audrey takes up the bulk of the episode and very little is added to the long-standing arcs except that the mysterious Colorado Kid who was so central during the last cycle of the troubles may be even more mysterious than he first appeared.A good but not great opening to the season, but I love Haven and believe that the writers are holding back on major revelations in order to dish them out over the entire season. Finding out who or what Audrey is and how Duke will cope with his destiny and whether Audrey and Nathan will overcome the star-crossed nature of their relationship and what the truth about the two newspaper brothers and previous incarnations of Audrey is....just so many great plot arcs and I will be tuned in on Fridays to see how it all plays out. If you are new to Haven I recommend starting with Seasons 1 and 2 and entering the troubled world of Haven at your earliest possible convenience."
B009F7QE0E Great plot more twists and more questions what is going on. Is she a God?????. This series just keeps getting better and better"
B009F7QE0E The stories always keep you entertained and surprised.  Not the same old stale stories that a lot of shows keep repeating."
B009F7QE0E Haven you have not let me downthe Season # 3 is as great as the pilot...thank you so much for not being like the other series that run out of material"
B009F7QE0E Having just watched the Season Three conclusion, I have to say I am in awe of the Haven series writers. This has to be the best 13 episodes in television history. The 13th episode made me want to fast forward my life until Haven returns next season. What an absolutely fantastic way to leave someone hanging by their fingernails on the edge of a cliff...Night (Devil's Radio)"
B009F7QE0E The show continues to be creative and interesting.  The writing is good and the characters are multidimensional but remember these are based on a story by Steven King so they don't always play nice :)"
B009F7QE0E Along with Lost Girl and Being Human, Haven gets as good as Syfy can get. The series has an intriguing plot, is well directed and well acted. Emily Rose is excellent and really should spring of to a full fledged movie career after Haven. Eric Balfour is absolutely great as Duke, the actors playing Nathan, the newspaper brothers and all the rest are top notch. I wish however that they had kept The alternate Audrey from season two on. The intricate pulls you in as the story is woven, but nothing is down to just simply be weird. Everything has a purpose, like the classic The Prisoner. I love it."
B009F7QE0E Admittedly, I struggle with programs that I just don&#8217;t &#8216;get.&#8217;  I don&#8217;t mean that their meaning or plots or characters or themes escape me; rather, I don&#8217;t get how they uncover, hold, and reward an audience.  I know that my tastes as I&#8217;ve grown older have changed quite a bit in what I&#8217;ll accept in weekly dosage of television viewing, but why is it I have trouble turning my brain off with some series while I don&#8217;t with others?  In many cases, I tend to believe that, if the production qualities are high, then the writing, ideas, and characters should be equally compelling.  As is the case with a little something called HAVEN, that may not be the case &#8230; but why shouldn&#8217;t it be?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)FBI Agent Audrey Parker (played by the lovely, fresh-faced Emily Rose) came to Haven for the view, but she quickly found herself drawn into the local mysteries involving all things supernatural.  And why wouldn&#8217;t she?  Where else are you going to find alien abductions, dogs turning into people, haunted houses, and time travel all serving as local diversions?  As fate would have it, Parker is quick to learn that she might have vastly more to do with these local legends than anyone would&#8217;ve guessed!HAVEN is exactly the kind of programming made for today&#8217;s Syfy Channel (where it airs in the U.S.).  It&#8217;s filled with neato-keen ideas, acceptable TV-grade special effects, and actors who all look like underwear models.  I say that not meaning any of it as a slight; rather, it just seems tailor-made to fit into a show designed to appeal to the much sought after youth demo who tend to be a bit more forgiving about what they&#8217;ll spend an hour (or 43 minutes without commercials) watching while happily germinating on the couch.In the 1990s, TWIN PEAKS was all the rage &#8230; well, for a short while, at least.  It tapped into some of the same underlying themes &#8211; i.e. small town life, local legends, nothing is quite what it seems, etc. &#8211; and, for the bulk of its two season run, it managed to eek out a fair share of stories bordering on cosmic coincidence and/or plain spookiness.  HAVEN tramples on similar ground, albeit with much more expectable writing and less active posturing on the part of its players.  Each hour presents a single mystery; tinkers with its various circumstances enough to maintain the viewers&#8217; interest; and then most things are wrapped up within 60 minutes of TV time.  Its writers have cleverly incorporated their own ongoing mythology, but methinks all of those questions won&#8217;t be answered until the series&#8217; inevitable finale.  After all, all good things do come to an end, kids.The idea is based on the book by Stephen King published under the &#8216;Hard Case Crime&#8217; imprint, and it was called &#8220;The Colorado King.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s the dirty little secret: truth be told, King&#8217;s book wasn&#8217;t really all that good &#8211; it certainly wasn&#8217;t much of a mystery, not like the &#8216;Hard Case&#8217; books that had come before, but that didn&#8217;t stop editors from blazing ahead with a King novel hoping his name would spur sales.  &#8220;Kid&#8221; felt like a knock-off, and I&#8217;ve no doubt some might say the same about HAVEN.Call it what you may, I found it passable entertainment.  It didn&#8217;t tax me too much.  It showed me some pretty actors up against some pretty scenery.  And, after 60 minutes, I was free to go about my life looking for something with a bit more meat on its bones.HAVEN: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is produced by Entertainment One, Big Motion Pictures, Piller / Segan / Shepherd, Universal Networks International, and CanWest Global Television Network.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (E One).  As for the technical specifications, this hourly sci-fi-lite drama is smartly produced, so it&#8217;s full of flawless sight and sound.  To its credit, this four-disc set comes loaded with special features, including audio commentaries, a documentary, cast interviews, a Comic Con appearance, bloopers, and even more: well done to all participants because this is what fans love to see.RECOMMENDED.  It may not be for me, but it&#8217;s fine for thee if that&#8217;s your tastes.  For me, there was no better exploration of the eerie small town milieu than the oft-maligned and equally misunderstood TWIN PEAKS; still, HAVEN has some respectable if not predictable charm.  Chalk that up to its good-looking cast, its saccharin writing, and its tween-ish romanticism.  No, it may not be perfect, but it&#8217;s a Syfy program, after all, so that bar is aptly set low.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with a DVD copy of HAVEN: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B009F7QE0E Season Three presents us with more of the same. The Town of Lunenburg continues to be a major character in the series and the brothers who co-publish the local paper still steal every scene in which they appear though their part in the goings on in town becomes more and more ambiguous and sinister. The byplay between Nathan and Duke continues to amuse and as the season begins it becomes apparent that the shot fired off camera at the end of season 2 as the two were struggling with one another was a tease. New twists include seeing Nathan shot to death and resurrected and he and Duke tele-ported back to 1955. We get to hear the same music featured in October Sky. Somehow the plots seem to become more contrived this year. The mystery of who Audrey is and how she came to be in Haven continues to develop and we are left wandering how long she will remain, will she disappear as mysteriously as she came, and will she reappear. I cared more about the outcome in the first two seasons but it would be a rare show that killed off one of its three main characters."
B009F7QE0E I just love this show. So different. We learn about Audrey and the Colorado kid. I will watch season four."
B009F7QE0E This is truly a unique and entertaining show.  From the very first episode in season 1, I was hooked!!  The writers carefully and masterfully draw the viewer into the mythology with each episode while also dangling answers to some of the questions in order to keep the viewer coming back each week.Haven, Maine is a town where people who suffer from supernatural afflictions come to live.  Most of the time, Haven is a safe place to live but every 27 years the \"troubles\" appear, causing the \"troubled\" (those people suffering from these supernatural afflictions)to have to deal with their afflictions, which can sometimes be deadly.  Audrey Parker, an FBI agent, comes to Haven on a case but soon discovers that this town has many secrets, some which may provide answers to her past.  She also discovers that she has an uncanny ability to help these people, especially since she seems to be immune to the troubles.  However, there are some people who don't want her in Haven, and there are others who would like to see the \"troubled\" eliminated.There are many mysteries to be uncovered such as who really is Audrey Parker?  What is the cause of the troubles?  Who is the Colorado Kid?  Who killed the Colorado Kid and why?  What can be done to make the \"troubles\" go away?  In season 3 some of the answers are revealed but then new questions are raised.I wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good thriller but be warned - you can't watch just  one!  Once you start, you will want to watch all available episodes, maybe even more than once.  I've found that I pick up things that I missed the first time around."
B009F7QE0E Having been a fan of Haven from the start, this is getting increasingly twisted. Story twists and turns that, surprisingly, don't feel forced, but natural to t
B009F7QE0E This is a review of the 3rd Season of Haven - the DVD set. By the way Amazon, it's really irritating how you mix episode and season set reviews together. Makes it impossible to follow some of these reviews.Any way, there are a ton of questions answered in Season 3. So many in fact, you kind of wonder how they can fill a 4th Season.Other than Duke, many of the characters seem to regress during Season 3. Nathan gets called a hypocrite by Duke. And Duke is completely right. Nathan does some things that seem completely out of character to me. Audrey, not as bad, but also really does something cruel to Duke. And the characters get a case of the stupids in not confiding to each other. Amusingly, it turns out they have a really good reason not to trust each other, but THEY DON'T KNOW THAT at the time.The season ends on a big cliffhanger, which really makes me wonder how they can fill a 4th Season. The DVD set includes a small comic book that takes up right after the finale. It's narrated by everyone's favorite WWE superstar.Don't get attached to the new characters introduced this season.Claudia Black has a great guest appearance this season.I do give the writers credit as you watch a character make some stupid decisions during the season, and they do explain it perfectly. Well done writers.I waited to see Season 3 before reading up on it. With the way it went, I'm going to need to know how Season 4 goes before I buy it."
B009F7QE0E Now we have the new twists as time is running out for Audry - Skin Walker... who is it under the skin?"
B009F7QE0E This episode, stay, is the worst in an at best mediocre series. It is so stupid that the actors seem on the verge of laughing when they say their lines."
B009F7QE0E Haven's female protagonist is on a mission to find her mother.  With the help of two fairly strong and good male leads and a town populated by very unique residents with &#34;troubles&#34; (individual super-natural gifts that often get them into trouble), agent Parker (FBI agent turned local cop) embarks on a series of entertaining adventures.  The concept and plots are innovative.  The choice of the female protagonist is questionable as she is a bit too &#34;Barbie-Doll&#34; for my taste.  She does an good but not excellent job in her role but really needs to show more grit and emotion to make this good series into an excellent drama.  Overall, definitely worth your time if you are a sci-fi or thriller buff."
B009F7QE0E I love haven.  I have watched it since the beginning.  I miss when it is not on.  A great show"
B009F7QE0E They just seem to get so close to a solution and then it slips away.  Writers for this show must have some serious creativity to not repeat the same issues over and over again."
B009F7QE0E I have all three seasons of Haven.  They are all awesome. I love anything Stephen King, books or movies or series."
B009F7QE0E this show just keeps getting better. We are now into the 3rd series and the characters are well established. I still miss the father of the cop character from the first season , but other than that you have a fine ensemble cast. In this one 'audrey' must stop a troubled person from killing off people by drowning them. Is that person evil or is it not their fault that their trouble is killing people off? You never know with this show , as the mystery has played out over the seasons we learn more but there is still more to learn. Which is a good thing. I miss the chemistry between the two leads; parker and the cop. And the mysterious new big city detectives storyline is intriguing. But you don't have to have watched all the previous episodes to enjoy this one.  the hd looked good on this one. Better than on csi by a long shot."
B009F7QE0E It seems like no one has heard of this show when I mention it... but it is worthy of being compared to any other suspense/action program on TV.  If you start watching this show from season one, be aware that the first couple of episodes the actors seem a little wooden, but that changes quickly and you will be pleasantly surprised at how they and the stories shape up.We are in what I would guess is the final season, tho' I am not sure, since the episodes are now racing towards what would seem to be the conclusion.  This season has been CRAZY... episodes are faster, with tons of action, more intense inter-character relationships and a broader mix of issues the characters have to deal with."
B009F7QE0E Doesn't have much to do with the Steven King novel that it arose from, but is a very fun show. One of the best shows ever created by SyFy. Plots are intricate enough and its easy to empathize with the characters."
B009F7QE0E I like this show but was expecting more King-like aspects.  It's very well done in it's own right and I hope they can keep the story going for at least one ore season."
B009F7QE0E I wasn't sure I would like this program but it is Stephen Kings best work.  It has such a variety of odd stories that you can't wait to watch the next.  I never get tired of watching them over and over because of such unique tales"
B009F7QE0E This is kind of like x files where many one show plots independently surround a deeper, more mysterious story that carries on across multiple seasons. Great show."
B009F7QE0E I really enjoy this show. I just put in a disc and sit back and relax with it. It makes me comfortable to be in Haven with all of it's characters and subplots. It is easy to follow and a fun ride at the same time. The characters are likeable and you care what happens to them. I recommend this easy going series to those who like a good but light fantasy series you can't go wrong on this show and it is refreshing to just watch a good show after a tough day."
B009F7QE0E I had missed several episodes of Haven last year for several reasons. It was good to catch up on the 'adventures' of everyone in the cast."
B009F7QE0E This is one of the best seasons ever. There are plenty of twists and turns in this season. They answer a lot of the unanswered questions and lead up to an amazing season in season 4."
B009F7QE0E Here is another show that breaks from the norm and sets out on a new and different path.  A cast of characters with special abilities that are drawn to the town of Haven.  Also includes a love triangle that doesn't get too gooey.  I highly recommend this show.  Maintains the high standards set by Season 1 & 2."
B009F7QE0E Haven is a great fictional, sci-fi television drama that airs on SyFy. The town of Haven is home to many troubled, or supernaturally affected, persons. Their &#34;powers&#34; are interesting and many.Former FBI agent Audrey Parker, turned local cop, spends a ton of time here solving local mysteries and piecing her own history together. She is paired with local enforcement officer Nathan to chase down clues; some of them leading to her heritage.This season has been my favorite thus far. It really delves into the &#34;how&#34; and &#34;why.&#34; More and more of the back story begins to come out, as well as this infamous Colorado Kid.Haven is a very mature show for the genre. It is very original. It is kinda of &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; mixed with a good law enforcement show. I love the characters because they are rational, grounded people. If you enjoy fantasy with normal minded people, you will love it."
B009F7QE0E I like it and am quite anxious to see the next season. Interesting take on SciFi. Don't pass it up."
B009F7QE0E This is why I hate filling these things out. I don't really have anything  to say outside of what I already said."
B009F7QE0E First let me say that I'm a huge fan of this show and have been since it first came out. I already own the first two seasons on Blu Ray and when this season comes out I intend to buy it as well. I bought it as a download because I didn't want to wait until it came out on disk. This show is famous for its twists and turns and this season is no exception, the season finale is one of the best episodes ever and asks as many questions as it answers. I highly recommend all three seasons of this series, i would rate them all five star."
B009F7QE0E I love this series and all the actors in it.  I love how their characters are melding together and growing. I cant wait for the next weeks show to come."
B009F7QE0E WHEN THIS PROGRAM FIRST CAME OUT ON THE TV, I WAS NOT TOO SURE ABOUT IT.  ONCE I STARTED WATCHING IT, I WAS HOOKED.  NOW THE 4TH SEASON IS ON TV SO I WILL WATCH THIS TO REVIEW THIS SEASON BEFORE I WATCH THE NEW ONE."
B009F7QE0E Excellent series, this whole third season builds to a tense climax that has left me really wanting and hoping that there will be a season 4. This series does become an addiction, the paranormal, the back stories and the characters building and maturing throughout. The main characters become old friends that you care about. Would love to see this series continue."
B009F7QE0E This a review of the complete third season. Haven has always been an odd mix of genres. A little twin peaks, a little X-files, and a little twilight zone, somehow equals one of the most fascinating and entertaining shows on TV. The first and second season, while heavy on action, were unfortunately light on answers. Haven is a show with many layers, and I am happy to say many of those layers are revealed in this fantastic season.Along with a plethora of answers, all of which are very, very satisfying, in this season, the show embraces its darker nature. A running storyline is following Haven's first serial killer. The mysterious villain is an old trope. Usually, the more light is shed on said villain, the less intimidating they become. It speaks to the talent of Haven's writers that the more light that is shined on this character, the deeper its shadow becomes. The more we learn, the darker and more depraved the character is revealed to be.The cases of the week are just as strong in this season, and the smattering on new characters are all very effective. For the sake of preserving the story, I won't name them, but I can promise that you will not feel the same way about them at the end of the season as you did when they are first introduced.The backbone of this show has always been the relationship between Audrey, Nathan, and Duke. Little has changed on that front, in fact their relationship's have only intensified. This, however, is where my only nitpicks on the season come in. Nathan has always been wary of Duke, but the extent to which he takes it can become silly, at times. It is tiring to see him constantly doubt this man that he has watched do the right thing, time and time again. While the shows writing remains rock sol
B009F7QE0E I got sucked in to this series from season 1 with its engaging characters, mystery, and beautiful scenery and continue to watch with great enjoyment."
B009FJJNQE If amazon would allow less than one star, this would be one of those films (film being very loosely, and I mean VERY, used in this review. Yes, I know this was a \"short\").I read this synopsis: A fairy tale for adults about a little boy who has to gain strength and courage, to find his way out of a mysterious place by making the ultimate sacrifice.The synopsis was absolute nonsense and ABSOLUTE BS, designed to get someone to watch this drivel.Yeah, I thought this might be cool to see, considering it was about 20 mins. I was wrong. Incomprehensible, lackluster, disjointed. Just a lame 'crossing over after death' story. Hard to follow, and contrary to what others have said, I cannot imagine how dull and pedantic it could be if the story was 'fleshed out'. I would place this on the list of \"high school media: the early years\"- if it was imaginative. This \"short\" was short of story, sense, imagination, and anything else that would make it worthwhile to even watch."
B009FJJNQE I was watching Grimm and this popped up under Amazon's suggestions.  It was only 18 minutes and the description said it was for adults, so I was curious.  Good production value, good acting, good story.  I think it was for children, though parents should be present.  I guessed the subject matter from the title and picture of the lighthouse on the jacket.  I don't know why this was made or who the targeted demographic was.  I would recommend this, I guess.  Don't expect science fiction."
B009FJJNQE However, everything considered, I have to admit that I prefer a more clearly-defined story line with a clear d&eacute;nouement, if I am watching for pure entertainment.  Some will laud this film.  Had it been longer, with fuller development, it would have been better suited to my simple taste.  Still, not a bad way to spend twenty minutes, all things considered."
B009FJJNQE The production is beautiful, and the acting is excellent, but the story simply plays out a series of cliches that never add up to make a plot, and by the end, when you realize it was exactly what you both expected it to be and hoped it would not be, this albeit well-made short falls flat."
B009FJJNQE The Obolus in nothing that you'd think it is. Without giving too much away, it's about a journey that we all must take. It's only about 20 minutes so everyone can find time to watch it ... you won't be disappointed."
B009FJJNQE A story of transition. Well filmed and acted. A very sad and somewhat sweet story of a young boy grappling with a very strange and tragic situation."
B009FJJNQE for people.  Short, sweet, poignant, and to the point.  Very good acting, cinematography was excellent - the palette was pleasing to view and contributed to audience emotions.  I knew by the title what the plot must be about; I was a little surprised by who crossed, as I was expecting someone else.  Very touching and I can and will recommend this title."
B009FZFONO It was still pretty good and interesting. Sadly 'clan wars' took about the whole season. I wish there was a little more than just that. But then there's season 4. So I guess it's okay. Also glad some of the characters were gotten rid of. Finally we'll see some of the new characters. Glad the best characters are still alive and kicking :)"
B009FZFONO Love this series, never read the comics but I might just check them out now, oh wait i don't read comics.Great plot, characters ect, oh and lots not forget zombies"
B009FZFONO I don't know about other fans/viewers for the show. But last like 2-4 episodes seem like disappointing filler episodes almost. Least for season 1 and 2 if I recall, least each episode seem to have a purpose of some sort. I just home last like 2 episodes something crazy happens."
B009FZFONO Looking at other people's reviews I'm clearly in a minority. After all, what could possibly be more wholesome than yet another TV series in which the good guys blast away at all & sundry with a never-ending stream of Hollywood rounds (the sort that keep on coming long after the magazine is empty...)? Best of all, we don't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because - now this is the Really Good Part, honest - the victims are already dead! What could be better than that?? Needless to say the acting is average, the script is wooden, the plot is essentially non-existent, and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.But, if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for, because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86% of the population is either fat or morbidly obese, everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles. Realistically this show ought to be about The Waddling Dead but here in TV land being a zombie means you're pretty darn lean. Not that it matters - gore is gore, blood is blood, and in the end they're all just targets. Remarkably, whereas in the real world people have to train extensively to manage head shots with any degree of consistency even against static targets, here even kids can make special-forces style shots with total accuracy. No one ever gets hit by blue-on-blue, there's never a negligent discharge, and the concept of a ricochet is entirely alien.In other words it's basically boring repetitive mindless violence for the over-two crowd. Presumably the series appeals to couch potatoes who simply haven't anything better to do with their lives. As for me, enough is more than enough. This is tedious and violent rubbish - the mental equivalent of eating junk food. Avoid at all costs."
B009FZFONO There's really nothing else I can say.  This season has been excellent, the writing is honed to a knife's edge and each episode feels like a roller coaster of emotions and creativity.  I love it and I can't get enough of it, and the darker it becomes the more interesting it seems to be."
B009FZFONO Walking Dead was an extremely pleasant surprise during season one...it seemed to come out of nowhere, if you weren't a fan of the graphical novels.The plot lines have been, of course, fantastical yet also very grounded...allowing watchers to ask themselves the most fundamental questions of these scenarios:  What if I were to face such a situation?  How would I respond?  How would I cope?That it wasn't about survivalists or preppers, per se, is also good.  It was/is simply about some normal people living their lives...and suddenly those normal lives are taken away and they are thrust into the nightmare that never ends.Season 3 continued the high quality of the show--maybe even upped them.  These folks are walking through the valley of the shadow of death...and no punches are pulled.I had only one real unanswered question from this season:  WHY did the governor want to kill off so many other survivors?  Jealousy?  Wanted to be the biggest fish in a pond kept intentionally under-populated?  The guy is insane, of course...but even insane people have SOME reason for what they do, if only in their own minds.I do object to the (mostly-profiled) nudity inserted into some of the episodes...it wasn't necessary, nor did it add anything to the plot lines.  Huh?  What?  WHY??  Just a chance to show off some gal's skin and earn a TV-MA rating, for whatever reasons."
B009FZFONO Way better than season 2.  I'm looking forward to the second half of this season, starting this weekend!  It's really about the people, not the zombies."
B009FZFONO Since we no longer have Breaking Bad, it is currently better!  Once you start watching this series, you won't want it to end!"
B009FZFONO Love it, love it, love it!! If you're not a fan of apocalyptic stories or zombies than this isn't the show for you. In this season we see the world of humans as treacherous as that of zombies."
B009FZFONO I have to say I think that though this was a good season per say this show has &#34;Jumped the shark&#34; and I most likely will not get next season"
B009FZFONO I feel like this season is delving deep into character, especially Rick.  I'd like to know more about Michonne.  We'll see how the rest of the season progresses."
B009FZFONO I enjoyed the first two seasons, but this is- by far- the best. We see the characters struggle - we watch them grow and change in the face of unspeakable horror. Incredibly well acted."
B009FZFONO This show gets progressively better and better as the cast and story expands' The viewer comes to actally know and empathize with so many of the cast and their losses and grief. There is frustration with many of the characters as they refuse to adapt and accept the lossof so much that may never be able to be replaced or recovered. That very refusal leads to many unnecessary deaths and much grief and yet they feel they must cling to their very &#34;humanity&#34; or everything worth living and striving for is already lost.... A dilemma without n answer?"
B009FZFONO This is an exceptional series following a rag tag group of people through a bleak, dangerous world. Few new characters introduced. Some have outlived their usefulness and departed, permanently. Really don't know how they will conclude in the eventual rounding up of this saga. Hope it isn't for a while yet."
B009FZFONO This show is epic... Mad max meets zombie land humor gore everything good and everything bad... It's a great show!"
B009FZFONO Interesting story line.  More a story about survival than a senseless zombie flick.  The type of series that makes you think &#34;what if???&#34;"
B009FZFONO great show... keeps getting better... i cant wait for season 4... one question though: who's mowing all the grass? ;)"
B009FZFONO That My Favorite Tv serie I Love To Watch The Zombie Movie. Let Me Know When The Walking Dead Back Video."
B009FZFONO More than seven months after being forced to flee Herschel's farm, Rick Grimes and the group he leads are tired, ragged and badly in need of shelter and a place to relax. Stumbling across an abandoned prison, they set about clearing it of walkers and turning it into a base of operations. Meanwhile, Andrea, separated from the rest of the group, has hooked up with a sword-wielding loner named Michonne (who uses 'neutralised' walkers - with their arms and jaws removed - to carry supplies). They find an apparent safe haven in the town of Woodbury, run by the apparently well-meaning 'Governor'. But it isn't long before Rick's group and the Governor's followers run into one another, setting the scene for a major confrontation and testing the loyalties of those in both groups.The Walking Dead is a contradictory series. On the one hand, it's often compulsive viewing. It's more ruthless to its characters even than Game of Thrones and Lost (the latter of which it is beginning to resemble more and more) and the show puts a pleasing emphasis on taking common sense precautions against the zombie threat (although it's not above using individual moments of implausible stupidity for dramatic gain). On the other, it often promises more than it delivers and the first two seasons both had a tendency to deploy filler material. The third season is an attempt to tackle these issues and play to the strengths of the premise whilst not getting bogged down so much. Unfortunately, this was sabotaged from the get-go by AMC's demand that the season be extended to sixteen episodes, which turns out to be about four too long.The series starts off promisingly. The delayed discovery of the prison (which we saw in the final shot of Season 2 close to Rick's group but it's taken seven months of them going round in circles to get back to it) and the need to clear it out provides a lot of dramatic impetus in the early episodes. Splitting the group, getting Andrea and Michonne to Woodbury and a dramatic reunion with a missing former member of their group all provide strong storytelling opportunities. The introduction of the Governor, played with relish by David Morrissey, is well-handled and giving Rick a nemesis and someone to bounce off is a great idea. The first half of the season is indeed The Walking Dead at its best, featuring some rich scenes of character development and even some satisfying action scenes (even if the ease with which walkers are now being dispatched compared to earlier seasons is starting to get a little silly).Things deteriorate rapidly in the second half. Some rather bizarre wheel-spinning kicks in and we get a face-to-face confrontation between Rick and the Governor which really doesn't do anything, as well a completely pointless episode featuring two characters playing cat-and-mouse in an abandoned warehouse. As more excuses are found to delay the big finale battle, things get less and less plausible until scenes that were supposed to be powerfully tragic become instead rather comical. There's also less focus on the day-to-day details of living with the walker threat; in the final episode people are casually leaving gates open and walking past biters without too much care. The second half of the season does retain some dramatic highlights, such as Carl Grimes graduating from 'pointlessly hanging-around kid' to 'PTSD-suffering child soldier' and the intriguing arrival of Tyreese (played by The Wire's Chad Coleman), but it's a far cry from the opening half.Ultimately, the third season of The Walking Dead (****) is watchable, entertaining and features some very strong dramatic scenes and elements in its first half. The second half is more disappointing, featuring significant lapses in plot logic and characterisation. If anything, whilst the second season (which was a little too static) benefited a lot from being viewed in rapid-fire on Blu-Ray, the third season suffers, with the longueurs in the second half being far more incongruous than if viewed from week to week."
B009FZFONO The acting by all of the actors is superb ~ truly shows the diversity & perserverance of the human race to survive under &#34;extreme&#34; conditions!"
B009FZFONO Every episode is filled with excitement. I missed an episode and downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. How easy. No skips and stops or slowdowns. Smooth as silk. The price was really attractive. I know now not to get too worried if I do miss it because it will be there for me on Amazon."
B009FZFONO The writers are killing off all the original actors so fast before their characters are fully developed. Some of these zombies need to start starving off or rotting away. Fewer but faster and deadly walking dead that have tactics & work as a team in wolf pack instead of mass slow herds."
B009FZFONO Wow this series just keeps getting better each season. This set is another fabulous edition to the collection. Kirkman and company never fail to entertain. Often when watching the show on cable tv it is interrupted with allot of commercials. This is a great way to watch the show again without the need to be bothered by them. Some people DVR this show but you still have to go out of your way to fast fwd through them and that can be an annoying task."
B009FZFONO Action light episodes and even a large lack of zombies in most episodes make for a lackluster season. It seems to crawl along at a frustrating pace"
B009FZFONO Exciting, I totally love the action and the relationships developed during the program. I hope it goes on for many seasons."
B009FZFONO Every Monday after a new episode, it's the same old thing. \"cannot connect\"  Can't leave feedback. Can't download. It might be easier to just pay for the cable and watch it on AMC, and get rid of Prime, and quit PAYING for episodes that cannot be streamed or downloaded on MONDAY."
B009FZFONO My daughter talked me into watching The Walking Dead and I started with season one on Netflix. Fell in love with the show so just had to buy season 3 from Amazon as soon as it came out.  It is in my video library so I can watch it from my computer anytime I want. Surprised that I like the show so much and was thrilled to see the beginning of season 4 that started on Sunday, 10/13/13."
B009FZFONO Best show on TV, great special effects, lots of action, I love it. Great acting, I can't wait to see season 4."
B009FZFONO The episode, \"Killer Within\", made me cry.  How crazy is that?  A series about zombies and I end up sobbing. This season has really amped up the action.  Every week you never know what will happen next.  Anyone can live, anyone can die!  I am a little afraid that the sequences with THE GOVERNOR and his town could possibly slow the pace down but who knows? So far season 3 is on a par with season 1 with non stop surprises at every turn.  The idea to have the setting at a maximum security prison was perfect.  With all the dark corridors and never ending zombies popping up when you least expect it is brilliant. I hope these kind of thrills and chills keep up throughout the rest of the season."
B009FZFONO This is the best zombie show..one of the best post-apocalyptic screen plays. Very well made and storyline is great. Picture and character development are great. Season 3 is either the &#34;governor&#34; season or the &#34;prison&#34; season. I dont think the prison is a pleasant scenery  ( the farm in the early season was much better ) ..but the story and actors make up for it.."
B009FZFONO This series is awesome the zombies are great and the series keeps you hooked. You will be waiting for the next episode with anticipation!"
B009FZFONO We're only half way through this season, but every single episode of the 3rd season has left me on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting the next.  The effects continue to improve with each season and the characters that I least like have mostly been killed off ;-)."
B009FZFONO I love this show and so does everyone else.  If you don't like it, something might be wrong with you.  I don't like that they split it up, but this season is great."
B009FZFONO I absolutely love this show! I did not initially think I would be into it, but I was hooked from the first episode... It is a lot like I Am Legend."
B009FZFONO Me and my husband started watching this series on Netflix and had to see the last season before the new one in October. Hands down the best show I have ever watched!!"
B009FZFONO I did not enjoy The Governor or Rick's freak out, but characters from the first season were brought back in and that was pretty great."
B009FZFONO Another fantastic season with plenty of twists and sub plots to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wife and I love to sit down and watch this season and the previous seasons even though we have already seen the episodes multiple times. Great storyline with plenty of character development."
B009FZFONO Can't get enough of this season, never knowing what is around the corner. Steady acting by the cast members. Norman Reedus is awesome and I hope he returns to the group!"
B009FZFONO At the end of Season 2, the most fascinating heroine appeared.  I couldn't wait for S3!  And what did that do?  Strip her of everything fascinating about her and turned her into a broody background victim.  BLECK!!!  And what did they give us instead?  A whole lot of blood and gore.  WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.  I tried to like S3, but it just got more and more pathetic and I really lost respect for the creators of this show."
B009FZFONO I have been waiting for this series forever. It is cool. Right now I'm having a love/hate relationship yet. I can't believe that some people are so stupid. BUT I still want to watch it every week!"
B009FZFONO The first couple of episodes were slow, in my opinion.  Didn't know if I liked the direction it seemed to be going.  But by the 3rd episode, all was well and the show was back on track with a vengeance!"
B009FZFONO I could hardly believe the episode was over the time went so fast. Your attention NEVER wanders. More great zombie battles and again kudos to whomever is doing their makeup and costume.  The workmanship and attention to detail is incredible. This is mirrored by the rest of the show which also seamlessly creates the prison and the Guv's seemingly idyllic town. Lots of action, lots of death...keep em coming!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are more deaths of key characters and this fits with the arc of the comics.  The only two characters who the comics' creator seems bent on preserving are Rick and Carl.  Everyone else is fair game.  So we lost more characters this time with the big one being Rick's wife. In the comics, Rick's wife is safely delivered of the baby but they are both killed during a huge fight at the prison.  In the tv version the baby lives while the wife dies during delivery. So the tv version has decided to add the baby as a character, just like it added Darryl as a character.Everything happening with the Guv is just like it unfolds in the comics and his pathology is given to us in bits and pieces. Darryl's brother being his sidekick is solely in the tv version because he doesn't exist in the comics.  So far, I think these additions work pretty well.Things will kick up with Michonne as she is onto the Guv while Andrea is increasingly beguiled by him. Michonne vs the Guv should be key as it is key in the comics. If you have loved this so far, that should really be the centerpiece of the whole season, those two locked in combat. You will love it."
B009FZFONO This show is awesome. I can't think of anything else to say but you have to use so many words to review."
B009FZFONO I have all the seasons and absolutely love this show. I just think they kill off too many characters to soon. Other than that I enjoy watching this show. Very entertaining. I can't wait until the next season.."
B009FZFONO Just finished watching and I'm speechless. Yet another well-written, superbly acted, taut episode. And absolutely heart-breaking.As much as I want to see this outstanding series continue, I don't see how it can. It won't be long before only the dead remain."
B009FZFONO Love this show!! So glad I can see it on Amazon - since my provider does not have it. This season is so good - it can only get better!"
B009FZFONO I hate scary movies, or slash and bloody gore movies. This show is keeps you on the edge of your seat, and I find my self cheering the group on. Yes it has a lot of gore but it seems more like something that really could happen and less for the effect of showing blood and gore. Like the traffic accident, everyone has to slow down and look even though you don't want to...."
B009FZFONO This rating is based on the show - not any technical difficulties. I feel that if you are going to give a review of an episode, book, etc., you should actually rate the show NOT the problems you had with streaming or downloading.  That is a totally separate issue. Yes, I get pissed off when technical problems occur, but that has nothing to do with the show itself.Walking Dead is wonderfully written and the characters are superbly developed. Practically every other zombie show I've watched (with the exception of I AM LEGEND and DAWN OF THE DEAD) have been ridiculously cheesy and not worth my time. TWD is in a class of its own.You cannot have constant zombie killing all day long in every freakin' episode. That would be boring and predictable.  You never know what to expect with this series. Like in Season 1 where the little girl was in that barn all along and she walked out. I never expected that. And in this season when Rick's wife died.  Total bombshell! This season an entire new cast of characters is being introduced and skillfully interwoven with the old cast. Brilliant writing. TWD is the BEST show on TV, hands-down. Period. I hightly recommend it."
B009FZFONO Update 4/1/13 just finished the last episode of tombs season 3. I cant wait to see what happens next. Seeing Adnrea go, well really wont miss herI have a feeling the now much larger group will be leaving the prison. Time for Rick and Crew to get their own town. How lucky you are if you have not seen the whole series and you can now watch 3 seasons straight through! This is one of the most popular shows on Tv for a reason if you are on the fence. Do not hesitate to buy all 3 seasons and watch them, I will for sure be rewatching the whole series again start to finish in the future.If you like end of the world stuff then this is of course a top 5 ever series for you, if you are just curious jump in you will love it, most negative reviews are because of people saying amazon downloading not working. I have had no problems myself.I am a zombie fan first off I must disclaim. Still even if I was not this show is awesome maybe even better then the comic which I also avidly read.If you are a zombie fan and have not watched it I dont think you are a zombie fan. For all others the characters, plot and post apolyptic world will draw you in and make you crave the next episode. The best shows out there for me are Spartacus and Breaking Bad. This show is equally if not even better. Watch every episode and let it develop, I am hoping for several more seasons although will be hard to imagine the show getting better then right now since the Governor episodes are also the best in the comic book."
B009FZFONO the show continues to show the nature of human beings even among the dead. Great show, great look at the psyche"
B009FZFONO WAIT FOR A PRICE DROP! If you're reading this most likely are going to buy this because you're a fan of The Walking Dead. my opinion is that this season was better than season two in many ways. And is definitely a must buy if you love this show. But wait for a price drop at the time of writing this review the DVD was almost $50 and the Blu-Ray was $100 that is just crazy. Now Amazon does offer price protection (if you preorder it and the price drops before it ships you get a refund of the difference) but still those prices are ridiculous especially for a one DVD and one Blu-ray disc set.IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS SHOW -Please do yourself a favor and start the show from the beginning. Many of the great shows on television now the walking dead included are showsl you derive the most enjoyment from when you watch them in order. I think the worst thing somebody can do is jump in to a show like this somewhere in the middle.Oh and of course Daryl is amazing and is constantly covered in sexy dirt #noHetero!"
B009FZFONO i loved the fact that you can watch it anytime and on my pc it was great. i tried to find these episodes on all different webs and amazon was the best."
B009FZFONO What can I say except that it gets more interesting and the writers seem willing to take some serious broad strokes with the story and cast. Keep it up!CJ"
B009FZFONO The caption on poster says it all: Fight the Dead; Fear the Living. I've noticed that the group takes the walkers in stride now. No fear, as long as they are not outnumbered, even leaving one stray walker alone. The focus of the show has shifted from fighting the dead, though that is still a big emphasis. Now, it seems that learning to live among the living in peace has become the order of the day. And it's not going real well. I've said it often... this is not my normal genre of show. But something in the first episode captured me and has held me rapt for every show since then... it's not a show about dead people, it's a show about relationships among the living in a world gone mad. If everyone is infected, the situation will probably never change for these folks.That provokes a sort of desperation in their living and clinging to each other. I could go on and on about this show. I don't watch any other show with this type of theme. Nothing compares."
B009FZFONO I can tell their still working on setting us up for a big season. I can be patient, not saying the episode was bad just slower, for now. Still a great show."
B009FZFONO My God what an episode. I was not expecting so much change so fast. The writers really know what they are doing."
B009FZFONO Especially love the ability to make the close captioning larger.Very easy to access...I give it 5 stars.Recommend to lovers of sci-fi."
B009FZFONO This season is amazing!!! Walking Dead is so intense.  I am definitely ready for the last of this season to come out.  Love the Walking Dead."
B009FZFONO I love me some zombies! The Walking Dead is one of my favorites, but this season is starting to get goofy and is beginning to turn into every other show. By that, I mean the conflict inevitably turns into a war of tribes and the unique piece of the storyline (zombies) becomes a faded backseat passenger."
B009FZFONO Hate gore, zombies, blood and guts - then go away! Love well written storylines with action and the occasional major actor death - - then get hooked on this series! Simple choice - watch one episode and you will either love it or hate it - - no in-betweens on this one!"
B009FZFONO The cast, the special effects, the Animatronics , the writing and the developing of the cast and new additions to TWD..............keeps getting better with every season! Can't wait for the next episode.....what is going to happen with Andrea and her new savior? How will they pull off taking over the prison? What the h*ll is Rick going to do with the prisoners who are NOT infected? Que suspenseful music.Other postings are giving a play by play account of The Walking Dead from Season 1 up to the first episode of Season 3.Well for us fans we know how exceptional The Walking Dead is ALREADY.For people who are not fans (yet)lol.............if you do not have cable/AMC to catch TWD:1) Rent the 1st Disc from Netflix Season 1 (YOU WILL BE HOOKED!)2) No Netflix.....No problem! Amazon has you covered.........you can purchase from Amazon Instant Video.You do not have to be into zombies to enjoy this show. There is a lot more to TWD then people infected with \"the walker\" disease."
B009FZFONO Rarely does a TV show come along that has the power that this one has. Much more than just a story about zombies, there is real drama and plot twists that always keep you guessing. No character (except maybe the leader Rick) is safe so you never know what is going to happen next. I actually am unnerved when I watch this show, and their cliff hanger endings always leave me wanting to know what happens next! The governor was a great addition to the current plot. He is as scary of a character as you can imagine. On the surface kind and gentle, and underneath a complete monster who will tell you all the lies you want to hear. I hope the writers keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to many more seasons of this fantastic series!"
B009FZFONO I'm not a real gore or zombie fan but Love this series! Always a great storyline.Makes you want to keep watching."
B009FZFONO Great show and the streaming via Prime via Roku has been easy and fast. It's also convenient to have this available when traveling."
B009FZFONO One of the best series on television. Season one was a little slow. Season two picked up the pace and now season three... amazing! The actors on this series are awesome. They do an amazing job making their characters real. The writing is excellent. Make up is superb. These zombies scare me. I noticed more gore in this season. I liked how this season is showing more of the human response to the zombie apocalypse. Not everyone who survives is going to be good. Not every good survivor will stay good. Writing this into the show makes it more realistic. I could say more but do not want to give out any spoilers. Overall this is an excellent series that just keeps getting better."
B009FZFONO I love this show. I really have nothing to say against it, it is amazing. I cant wait for season 4. Oh and I am not a zombie fan, really. I hate blood and guts and stuff jumpin out at you. But this show rocks."
B009FZFONO It's the Walking Dead! What much is there to say?!The picture quality was great and I will purchase more movies and television series from Amazon in the future."
B009FZFONO Walking Dead will enter history as one of the best TV shows ever.  The writing, the characters, the acting, special effects are all incredibly detailed and awesome.  Anyone not watching it is missing out."
B009FZFONO The first few season 3 episodes were a little slow, and it seemed like the series had seen better days, but now things are getting juicy again.With less emphasis on people fighting the walkers, and more on the experiences of the group, this story is full of never ending surprises for anyone who has never read the books.The actors do an outstanding job in their roles, and the situations the characters get involved in, keep me hoping this series continues for a very long time.What will Andrea do when she finds out her boyfriend is a disgusting psychopath?How about Earl and Darrel, how will they get along with each other now?What will become of Woodbury when the truth about the governer is revealed?How long until the next person gets bit?Will the disease ever end? Will the walkers ever die? Will Carl and his sister have a beautiful world someday? Or is the stinking world that the show is based on all they'll ever know?I haven't read any of the books, so I'll either watch the entire series, or make up my own ending.Is that a violation of the Patriot Act? Is the Patriot Act a violation of the United States Constitution? YES.And now that season 3 has ended, and no doubt season 4 will be the last, maybe, just maybe, people will have had enough of death, rot, murder, insanity, etc. for a while, but I doubt it.After all, the world hasn't ended yet, and isn't that what everyone wants? Like they will be one of the \"lucky\" few who will be around to watch it all happen, and then go on playing with all the toys that are left behind.Oh what a disgusting world. Stupid and disgusting.But yes, I like to watch the stupid program too."
B009FZFONO This show does not need words to rate it. This show has gone viral and everyone is dipping their hands in the cookie jar when it comes to this show. I couldn't wait for the new season to start and I just love this show."
B009FZFONO This show has moved from the simple zombie eats everyone with one hero left standing to a true human drama about survival.  I do not suggest it for the faint of heart with regards to blood and guts. But if you are past that, then the character development and the depth of the human relationships then this is truly for you.  Zombies are cool, but this is about survival, rebuilding civilization, and the importance of leadership that comes with consequences."
B009FZFONO What can I say.....I love this show. It has zombies, great characters, and delves into the frailties and shortcomings of the walking live ones."
B009FZFONO Season three finds the humans settling down in relative safety from the zombies. This allows the human drama to develop in spite of the ubiquitous, roaming zombies looking for lunch. A new human villain comes on the scene; more dangerous to our little group of cast aways than the horrid zombies. They battle but separate to fight another day in the next season, I'm sure. More needy humans find sanctuary. The zombies, still a constant threat, now comprise a back drop for the human drama which has emerged and takes center stage. I am looking foreword to another season; I hope-a-hope-a-hope."
B009FZFONO The Walking Dead Season 3, one of the best shows on television.  I love every minute of it, I'm looking forward for the rest of the season."
B009FZFONO I sleep better because of this show.  The acting is great throughout, restrained when needed and over-the-top scenery-chewing when called-for.  Enough said."
B009FZFONO My only problem with &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; is that there is not enough of it per season. I did not think I would like this show because I have always been afraid of such graphical bloody movies. But once I got past the first 30 minutes of the Pilot I WAS HOOKED for life."
B009FZFONO I am never disappointed in an episode of the Walking Dead, it is Just the best series ever, I highly recommend!"
B009FZFONO I really like this show even though scary shows are not really my thing.  Because scary shows are not my thing, this show scares the bejesus out of me.  Mainly because I don't think it's too scientifically off the mark that something like this could happen (a widespread viral epidemic that adversely affects humans, not flesh eating zombies).  The most scary thing is that the walking dead are not the most dangerous beings on the show.  The humans are worse. One epidemic sweeps the planet and human society descends into a Lord of the Flies sort of situation.  I stress out every Sunday evening."
B009FZFONO I can not &#34;not&#34; watch this series, scares the hell out of me, gives me nightmares in the daytime. LOL"
B009FZFONO Excellent remake of the comic book series with superb changes in the story. I especially like the new characters that have been introduced. Of all the deaths, I hated to see Lori go. I keep wondering what it will take to kill off all the walking dead? They surely must be susceptible to something."
B009FZFONO Last season was somewhat disappointing as I grew incredibly tired of the \"Days Of Our Lives\" crap between the Sheriff and his whiney wife/lying, ambitious Deputy crap. Glad as all hell to see the Deputy gone for good.The new season of course has our survivor band off the farm and apparently looking to stake claim on a prison. The whiney wife is still a cast member but she has finally seemed to have learned her place as the cheating cow she is. Perhaps now the Sheriffs son might actually survive and is becoming quite the real man that he has to be under the circumstances.I just can't wait until the scriptwriters find a way to write out the mewly wife entirely eliminating her histrionics as well as an original cast members salary. This will help toughen up the series and also help to extend the life of the show as regards budgetary matters."
B009FZFONO WD is getting better and better.Character are getting deeper and the show has great potential.IF the writers don't go corporate and smarmy, if the cast stays motivated, and if the story line opens up this might be magnificent.  But we need a deeper look at what happened.  We need a bigger view of what's out there in the world now.  We need a broader perspective and better practical input of what is going on. Those things can be the difference between clever and great."
B009FZFONO This season was a bit of a let down for me. The first half was very good, but the second half lacked the power of the team as a whole. I happen to like the team as a whole. The acting was just as good, and I understand the method that the creators were working with. I just didn't get the usual impact from the last half season of episodes. I didn't find myself that anxious for the next episodes to become available. The end scene with the dramatic &#34;They don't know who there messing with&#34; was empty to me. I am however anxiously awaiting the next season to see how it develops."
B009FZFONO Season 1, episode 1 is some of the best television you can ever see, some of the best story telling best whatever category you want. Then the rest of the season slowly falls down into your typical heap that only wishful viewers will keep watching. Apparently they fired all those people who were behind the scene's and they made season 2. Certainly shows as it was back to being amazing. Season 3, as often times as it is violent is also perfect in it's violence. Never does the violence come unprovoked and never do you stop hoping to see someone live, or die, or both. Everything is fleshed out, and everything is painted into a corner with no other way out for survival except the hard way. Truly enjoyable."
B009FZFONO You do not have to be a fan of the comic book to appreciate the show. Fantastic, gripping and brilliant."
B009FZFONO I didn't start out a fan of  Walking Dead, but my kids &#34;forced&#34; me to watch the show.  This season was heartbreaking, mind-blowing etc.  It was a good season.  Can't wait for the  next one."
B009FZFONO There is a reason this show is such a ratings hit.  Great acting, directing and writing.  I found this season, the best shows were the more intimate episodes (I know people love to see the weekly zombie slaughter).  When Rick and the Govenor meet to talk treaty, its subtle intensity will keep you enthralled.  The finale was a bit low key, but still enjoyable enough to make you look forward to Season 4."
B009FZFONO Following the Season 2 disaster (I gave it a 1 star rating), Season 3 is on track to be as good or better than Season 1 which I gave 5 stars.The action in this episode is almost non-stop, and during the slower times the tension between the group members is explored.Evidently, the writers took some writing courses over the Summer and have learned how to develop character and context without making it stupid and boring.This is what the Zombie Apocalypse is all about .  . . survivors living by their fighting skills and their wits . . . overcoming difficult situations with their cunning, problem solving and mental and physical toughness."
B009FZFONO Love the series, would recommend the 3 season to anyone. Every episode just gets better and better and wants me wanting more."
B009FZFONO The Walking Dead is without a doubt one of the best action/horror/drama shows on television today.  It is the only tv show I know of that combines all of those genres with great story telling and compelling characters.  There is hardly ever a dull moment and I cannot wait to see each episode to come and hope this show lasts for many seasons!!"
B009FZFONO I love seeing the zombies in varying states of ... umami but this show has really dragged for me and I really hate the commercial breaks BUT ever since the Season 2 finale, this has been a different show.  Having read the wikipedia on the comic, I dreaded Season 3 and while I hated the Andrea parts (unlike her conduct in the Season 2 finale), this season delivered so many more scenes that were just treats compared to the previous two seasons.I would definitely buy this season for the maximum price of $25.  I think it would be awesome to be able to sit through a commercial free marathon but if it is never priced right, I will just watch via netflix.I would never recommend Season 1 and 2 but this season was better than decent.  I noticed that Carol was practicing a la  Mengele when preparing for Lori giving birth but I never learned that this show is named after the musselman of concentration camps until I readMoni: A Novel of Auschwitz.  Unfortunately, that means that this  incredibly entertaining show is the delivery system for what the musselmen were living in the midst of i.e. the destruction and decay of murdered fellow inmates some missing body parts because of the starving prisoners delayed their own executions unlike the cannibalism for unity practiced by the Japanese army on Chinese citizens as well as Allied prisoners of war quarterway around the world at the same time."
B009FZFONO Me and my teens watched all three seasons in a weeks time.very well done. five stars! can't wait for the new season to air!!"
B009FZFONO I enjoyed season 1 and 2, but somebody hit the GO button this season. Right from the start you can tell things have changed, and it's a roller coaster ride. We love to see each episode and we hate to see each episode. The love is because the drama surrounding the environment rocks. The hate is because the emotions sometimes border on hopelessness."
B009FZFONO The best season ever.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. So many surprises in each episode."
B009FZFONO As someone who has never seen the comic books and started after Season 1 was already out on DVD - I've got to say this movie has surpassed my True Blood love.  Rick's character is frighteningly altered with the death of his wife and their rift prior to that.  Carl is turning into a kid soldier which the likes of aren't usually found on American TV.  And Darryl - DAMN!  The man has it all.  I cannot wait until the return in February, but I will have the popcorn ready as they enter the Governor's world."
B009FZFONO Goog series continuation without damging the plot in order to maintain viewership. I await the release of each episode. I guess I should have watched it on its air date, I'd be waiting either way."
B009FZFONO This is the one season that they could have done without.  Too much prison time and Woodberry time.  Not a good mix.  But you have to watch to keep up with the story."
B009FZFONO Love ABC's Lost? Try this! Just a great show all around, more focused on the characters than the zombies. But don't worry: there are plenty of jumps and blood as well!"
B009FZFONO G R E A T ! ! !  As usual it's been a very great series to watch and hope it will continue . . ."
B009FZFONO I found Season 3 to be rather boring and, depending upon what happens in October, I might drop Walking Dead from my watch list."
B009FZFONO Besides the horror aspect of the show.The writing, story line, characters and sub plots and stories.The actors themselves make it very believable.Best show on cable TV."
B009FZFONO great show once i got over the grossness factor. Unpredictable and keeps you guessing. who will get be the one to go next?"
B009FZFONO The standard fare of gratuitous bloody, undead violence is served up in abundance this season. With each season a new, increasing threat to survival is introduced. First, it was walkers. Then it was the elements and group dynamic breakdown, plus blood spurting random chomping on of beloved characters. Now, the living and the dead are menacing.I refuse to give a spoiler but I will say this: don't fall in love with anyone. Your heart will be broken."
B009FZFONO Amazing stories, acting and writing.  I love that no one is safe.  It keeps you on edge at all time because a character you like may get eaten at anytime."
B009FZFONO I enjoy this show but there are so many things to nit pick. Does anyone else recognize zombies that were killed in previous episodes? Sometimes I'll even see the same one within the same episode that was killed in an earlier scene. It's been over a year since the beginning of this, I think it's time for the zombies to start decaying and falling apart. They are infected with some virus, they aren't magic."
B009FZFONO I had to get caught up before I watched the next episode, and this was a great option to watch."
B009FZFONO Season 3 is great though better in its first half.  I recently caught the last 8 episodes and enjoyed it but had a few misgivings about the way some things played out.Initially, coming into Season 3, I thought the new look was great.  Still do.  Gone were the clean haircuts and clothes - these guys now look like they've just come back from Woodstock!  Plus the characters and story seem to have matured some. Some. Some episodes feel like they were written on the fly though.  By the time we start getting involved with the Governor's group, an element of cheese creeps into things.  He's a pretty bad guy I guess.  A little cheesy too.I liked the entrance of Michonne (and her sword) in this season.  Oh, and that's another reason the second half bugged me a little.* SPOILERS *That whole second to the last episode where Rick actually considers giving her up to the Governor??? Say what???!!!That was a BIT unbelievable. Could Rick be so stupid as to think you could even kind of take that snake the Governor at his word?  And more unbelievable yet, that afterwards Michonne could even look at Rick, let alone agree to continue living with them.  Seriously, that was so stupid my opinion of the whole series went down a notch.  Rick putting Merle up to capturing and delivering her to the Governor?  Even Merle has the sense not to do it!  And lucky for the series.  But how do you go back after that and take Rick even a little bit serious.  If you're Michonne, that is. The girl's got powers of forgiveness even mightier than her sword.  Actually she is quite an interesting character, and she often says quite a lot without saying a word.On the other interesting developments side, little Carl is becoming a killer - by necessity from the looks of things. After killing another boy, Hershel tries to tell Carl's father (Rick) that Carl nearly shot the other kid in cold blood \"as he was putting down his weapon\".. but it didn't look like the kid had really made up his mind to put down that weapon.  We, the viewers, were there!  So, this is the second time I come to question good Hershel's judgement.  The first time (this season) was when he was praying with his daughters from the Bible as they were all planning to capture and deliver Michonne to the Governor.  What a jerk.Anyway, in a nutshell, I liked the tone and pace of this season perhaps more than the first two seasons although Season 3 while faster pac
B009FZFONO I am not a fan of TV, in general, but this show is very entertaining. I think it is well written, shot and executed. The acting is also very good. While the zombie action is sometimes not the primary focus of an episode, you don't mind because of the great characters. The storyline is one that is not too far out there, and this helps pull you into the show. I recommend it."
B009FZFONO Still fresh, still good actor interaction, and great story lines.  Season three makes me want to see season four even more."
B009FZFONO I really enjoy the Walking Dead. I have been a fan from the very beginning. At times the show seems very drawn out but I really just watch it for the Zombies."
B009FZFONO It's a good series, that grabbed my attention enough to want to continue watching.  I look forward to watching more as they come out."
B009FZFONO This is what we waited for? What a major disappointment ! This is one chapter you can save your money on and you wont miss a thing"
B009FZFONO For the first time in a long time, saw and episode that I regretted paying for.  And that is a bad thing.  I gonna stick with this series for a while, but it's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.The brilliance of this show is its ability to address &#34;virtue&#34; on a very physical level.  I think they have of lost their way in this manner."
B009FZFONO I LOVE me some zombies!  And The Walking Dead does zombie brilliantly with a treasure trove of characters you will care about and lots of scares and chills!  Andrew Lincoln (Rick) plays a strong leader for an interesting, wonderful group of survivors whose number changes with every season.  You never know who will be next...or how.  The zombies look ridiculously real and terrifying.  Every time the group begins to get comfortable, a fantastic new situation arises that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
B009FZFONO Getting into mid-flight, then crashing again. That was season 3.So after the fascinatingly terrible second season we kick off the third season with a bang, the doofi haven't come up with a plan or anything but they're wandering aimlessly getting by when they find the prison and plan to make that their home due to it's impenetrable walls. The first half of season 3 is, actually pretty damn enjoyable! Rick's team scrambling to get their s*** together was pretty entertaining while Andrea's encounter with the Governor was pretty interesting. Unlike the second season where the actors sat around a farm and waited for their knuckle-dragging fanboys to shower them with money and praise, this season interesting things actually happen and the 7th Heaven conversations are vastly minimized to bare necessity.Rick's group was the most entertaining part of the show. A few major characters are unexpectedly killed off in gruesome ways and after one problem is dealt with another pops up. I guess it's because we're familiar with these people now that they all have a place in the situation instead of sitting around bored. The acting is still hammy and forced, especially by Rick who does the worst American accent I've seen in awhile. Apparently American's grunt all the time. His descent into madness though was nicely done. Carl also steps his game up this season, instead of annoying his parents and me, he has hardened into the situation and his actor doesn't play it cutesy or whatever. Short Round also steps his game up when he sees Rick going crazy, so it was nice seeing some development with these characters, lord knows it was long overdue but at least it's finally here.Then we got the other storyline with the Governor, and it was pretty interesting when you're first introduced to Woodbury. However a few episodes in this supposed badass Governor seemed to enjoy nothing more then sitting around drinking with Andrea and discussing their feelings, I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a scene they left on the cutting floor with both of them reading Cosmopolitan too. His arc is slow and boring, which was a bad call considering the producers want him to be a memorable villain. Basically after his eye's taken out he becomes a surly douche who is hellbent on destroying Rick and his gang for flimsy reasons, then the last scene you see him in he finally snaps into what we've been hinted at for an entire season.Andrea is also boring with her token black friend, I got little to no impression that they're friends, instead they seemed more like survivor acquaintances who at the first sign of shelter start snapping and b***hing at each other like rabid hyenas. Her arc was interesting regarding that she's one of the main characters in the comic who's still around. In the show, she goes to Woodbury, sleeps with the governor, wonders if he has some screws loose when she finds his human heads collection, tries to resolve the tensions between groups, then gets killed. Wow. I mean, half the season was dedicated to this sole character who slowly pieces together for 12 episodes \"governor... BAD!\", and then abruptly dies. I mean the surprise was nice but what a waste of time that ends up being watching this expendable character sit around, drink, and wonder if something's wrong.Michonne, like a malignant tumor, grew on me. At first she just glared at everyone/everything and clutch onto her unbreakable katana afraid everyone will take it. However once I got endless vapid dialogue with the other characters comparing periods her silence became welcoming to me, and I ended up liking her by the end of the season. Merle also comes back this season, but he basically just plays governor's lackey until he's betrayed, then turns into angsty jerk that no one likes. Like Michonne however, he was pretty straight-forward and not too talky which worked fine for me, also Michael Rooker is a great actor so he brought some dimension to Merle's character.So after the midseason finale when the governor's pissed off and Rick's going crazier, the show kind of just stops. They could've excluded the last couple of episodes and still worked. Instead we got many filler episodes, such as Rick running into the black dude from the first episode, and Andrea getting chased by the governor for an entire episode. Why did they even do that? Why did they bloat out a solid first half into more nothing? Why do the Walking Dead writers hold so much contempt for their fans? Why not end this season 12 episodes in or something, keep it lean and solid, or go the extra mile and give the season a clear resolution with the governor/rick's conflict, and make season 3 a knock-out? Oh yeah, because AMC doesn't care about quality.So season 3 definitely picks up from the soggy turd that was season 2 (really though there was no where to go but up), but flails and crashes after the halfway mark into another bafflingly mishandled season of the walking dead. It looks like the production team blew their entire budget on the first half then slapped a few filler episodes together centered around one character, and called it a day. So instead of this being a solid good season, it's a few good episodes, followed by nothing, followed by a giant middle finger, followed by credits. Really though, they promised for the finale 27 deaths, then it turns out that almost all of them were unimportant stock characters shot off screen. I'll give the writers this, they're intune with their fans pleads for mercy. They hated Lori, she died. They hated Andrea, she died.So all in all it concludes into a mildly diverting tv show, but it's never really scary, exciting, or engaging. The zombie apocalypse is still poorly shown and instead of a grittier more realistic survivalism story we still see characters sit around not doing too much. The gun handling in this is still laughably bad and the pacing gets progressively more sluggish as the season shambles along. Really though I've long given up higher expectations for this show, the fact that thousands of fans showered this season with praise before they even finished it (finale date - 3/31/13) shows that TWD fans are, still, gullible morons who see nothing wrong with paying $40 for another half assed season.P.S. Nice 5 star reviews that are 2 vague sentences of praise written by many people who have only reviewed The Walking Dead Season 3. F***ing viral marketing, how does that work?"
B009FZFONO I believe I was looking for another movie title and wasn't sure what a friend of mine was  watching.  This definitely was not the movie I wanted to watch."
B009FZFONO Been following them since Season 1.  Once in a while I go back and watch that first espisode.  It was sooo good."
B009FZFONO Walking dead they are... but there is a story with this show and that makes it exciting and full of suspense. Great Show!"
B009FZFONO Hopefully the writers and advertisers will see it our way and give us another season. I feel like there's a whole bunch more that can be told."
B009FZFONO It looks like The Walking Dead has really hit its stride with a superbly executed series 3 opener that doesn't waste any time at all. Months have passed since the end of season 2 and our group is short of food, ammo and conversation. All the soap opera squabbles are over, with Rick firmly in charge and everyone - including Carl - going for head shots on anything that moves and murmurs.Season 3 has also upped the zombie body count substantially and there are some inventive new zombie kills too. The comfort (and growing viewer boredom) with the farm is far behind us as the team have retreated into a prison where a whole array of new problems await. The prison promises some excellent twists and surprises for upcoming episodes judging by the trailers.The Walking Dead established itself as one of TV's best shows in the first season, then lost its way a little in the second, but is absolutely back on track. It's grittier, darker and more dangerous than ever before. The only question is -- who's going to get infected next?"
B009FZFONO Interesting enough to keep me watching. It did not go the way I would have chosen, but I am not the writer.  A reasonably well acted series.  Darryl and Merle were good while they lasted. Rick was loosing me, and the damn Governor is still alive. I really wanted Michone to take his head.  Now they have taken in Woodbury refugees and they still don't have much in the way of groceries.  They'll have to range wider for the scrounging and who knows where that will lead?"
B009FZFONO This is a very good show to watch online through Amazon. The price was reasonable & the picture quality was good. But since this show is often shot in dark settings, it is sometimes a little hard to see clearly. I should have tried it in HD even though it's more expensive, I probably will next time."
B009FZFONO Season 3 is INCREDIBLY fast-paced!!! While the program borrows elements of the prison/Woodsbury storyline from the comic, it takes a very different approach on the material. Must-see TV!"
B009FZFONO The writing, acting and stories never disappoint. This is such a quality show. Excellent!!!!! Who knew the end of the world has such great writing."
B009FZFONO I was hooked the first episode. The characters are wonderful, and the plot believable ( sans the zombies). They did a great job with casting characters. There are spooky and gory parts, so would not have kids younger than 15 watching this."
B009FZFONO This is yet another great installment of the walking dead.  I think Season three has recaptured some of the qualities that made season one so great (and seemed lacking in season two)."
B009FZFONO I came across this series only a few months ago. And was able to watch Season 1 & 2 with no commercials ... over a long weekend.Then couldn't wait for Season 3 on netflix, so thankfully Amazon provides a solution ... purchase access for like $1.50 per episode and watch it day after it airs...Rather than use my PC, I setup the Amazon movie app on my xbox 360 and watch it in comfort!"
B009FZFONO I really like this series for some reason, lots of action, good actors and keeps you on the edge of your seat thru the whole movie"
B009FZFONO Five stars for ANYTHING The Walking Dead does so far.  I've never been a zombie movie fan.  Cant say I've sat through a full zombie movie, beginning to end, in my whole life.  But I just love the Walking Dead.  So well acted, such great special effects, fantastic characters, storyline, all of it is terrific."
B009FZFONO The last episode ended as Rick chops off Hershel's leg after he is bitten by a zombie. As they worked on him 5 living prisoners pop up and surprise the group. The prisoners thought they were a rescue team but soon realize that they are just civilians. There is a fierce standoff and the group puts Hershel onto a rolling cart and backs cautiously out of the cafeteria.The prisoners follow them and there is another confrontation and Rick and Darryl back them down. They try to negotiate a peaceful coexistence but it is difficult. The group and Rick have to decide which is worse, the violent prisoners or the flesh eating zombies....This episode is simply the best one of all of season 1, 2 and 3. The action and suspense is nonstop. If they can keep up this type of intensity then this season is destined to be spectacular. This TV show is directed, produced, acted, and written like a top class movie with a lot of action. I loved this episode and I recommend it to you."
B009FZFONO First off, don't read the reviews that have one star. This is a great show. It will make a lot more sense if you start with the first season,The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season, and follow along with the secondThe Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray] and third seasonsThe Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season [Blu-ray]. I wasn't completely sure about it the first time I watched, but it became addicting. Will be interesting to see what happens with the prison, Carl, and the Governor."
B009FZFONO Action packed great show. Hubby got me addicted. Love the ease of a season pass the show just shows up in my library. This show is intense gory and scary. Not family fair by any means. But once you start watching you really want to know what is next."
B009FZFONO Okay, I'll be honest... I haven't been seen seasons 2 or 3 of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; because of work, but I had to have these limited editions."
B009FZFONO this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!!! so good!! we can not wait until the next season"
B009FZFONO The first half of WD was a bit slow and the writing was filled with some major cheddar, especially with the dialog betwixed the Gov and Andrea. Man O Man was that embarrassing! It finally got going in the 2nd half, and I am a big fan, having purchased and watched ALL of it in just a few days as I too am a WD head..."
B009FZFONO This show is amazing.  It's unpredictable and action packed.  It can be emotional at times.  I find myself talking to the television in much the same way my girlfriend talks to the tele during her soap operas.  This show is AWESOME! Gawr!"
B009FZFONO The seiries is still kicking butt after three seasons.  I have always been a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this series has consistently gone way above expectations.  LOVE IT!"
B009FZFONO Or better yet, DON'T read the comic. You'll probably like this more than I do.What have they done to Andrea and Michone?My God. Andrea is the furthest thing from a good character. Whiny, whiny, whiny. And Michone? WHY WON'T YOU TAAAAALK? Jesus, that's annoying.Rest of the cast is great. Can't wait for a zombie to munch on Andrea and Michone to cut off her head!!!"
B009FZFONO Thanks so much for this.  I needed to catch up!!!  Watched 1 and 2 on Netflix so needed to catch up with current shows.  Easy to download on the computer with no interruptions."
B009FZFONO This show continues to be fantastic. just enough balance of action and drama. Can't wait for the new season. Lots of plot twists that I never saw coming!!!"
B009FZFONO I've been watching this show since the beginning, but since I cut the cord & got rid of cable this year, I had to still get my fix. Buying the season pass on amazon was the way to go. This season was amazing, & can't wait for the next one! (which I will be streaming from Amazon again :) )"
B009FZFONO I watch each of the show from the beginning to the end , some not so excited and some excellent, always fun watching behind the pillow just in case the zombie attack , I think this show have the most realistic zombies ever , just to much but that is what make it different"
B009FZFONO until this series I never likes zombie movies and this got me hooked I cant wait for season 4 hurry up season 4"
B009FZFONO I purchased Season 3 via Amazon Prime because I like this show; I own the first two seasons also. thanx."
B009FZFONO How is it that I have supposedly \"purchased\" each episode so far, yet if I accidentally click on a previously-viewed episode I'm charged again, and supposedly \"purchase\" it again?  I'm a big fan of Amazon in general, but this isn't going well.  Customer support!  If you give me a sausage, or explanation (look through the records) I'll support your bad-ass further.  Otherwise \"meh\": you're toast.  We're talking 5 bucks or so."
B009FZFONO Actors are excellent!  Episodes go by so quick & when they end you just want more.  Great all around; I wouldn't watch without watching the first 2 seasons."
B009FZFONO This must be the best thing on Television that I've seen in years. Love it! Gritty, Riveting, Tense. A must see show for anyone who loves to watch characters react to each other and the world around them."
B009FZFONO Have rewatched the entire series from season 1-3 more than 4 times. LOVE. Scary at first, gruesome but once u get past that its ohhhhhh sooooooo good"
B009FZFONO THE TAG LINE for Season Three of AMC's megahit, \"The Walking Dead,\" is \"Fight the dead; Fear the living.\" No joke. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) leads his extended family to safety within the walls of a federal prison, clearing the grounds and buildings of zombies, only to face a deadlier menace from humans who are only a few miles away.The others, living in the well-fortified town of Woodbury, aren't so much the problem as their leader, a manipulative sociopath, who calls himself The Governor. Played in a brilliant, tour de force performance by David Morrissey, he defines the word \"diabolical.\"And we all thought Merle Dixon, Daryl's (Norman Reedus) older brother from Season One, was a bad guy. Turns out Merle, played with redneck panache by Michael Rooker, is working for The Governor. It also turns out that, while Merle seems pretty much the misogynistic bigot he always was, he has become much more violent since meeting Woodbury's boss. Body counts among zombies and humans continue to rise while the brothers Dixon share a tragic story arc. Sad to say, we also lose some characters we've known since Season One.Still, each of the favorites - including new characters - get their moment to shine in these 16 episodes. The high-definition five-disc Blu-ray is the way to go, too. Scenes take on feature-film quality; color is rich and detail outstanding. I've seen these episodes at least three to four times on high-def TV. Now, there is so much new detail onscreen, I wondered if the broadcast material had been extended. It hasn't; it just looks that fresh.The sound, too, is exceptional. A Dolby TrueHD 7.1 immersive soundtrack carries dialogue, gunfire, effects and ambient sound throughout all speakers. I'm from the south and I've never heard cicadas sound so menacing.Extras include commentaries on Episodes 4, 5, 8, 9 and 15, with directors, producers and staff. Newcomer Danai Gurira, who takes on katana-wielding warrior, Michonne, is on three of them. Mastermind and executive producer Robert Kirkland also appears on \"Made to Suffer.\"There are six good deleted scenes, the best from \"I Ain't No Judas\" with Carol (Melissa McBride) and Merle. It's been making the rounds on Facebook, so you may have already seen it. The scene from \"Clear\" with Rick and Morgan Jones (Lennie James, \"Low Winter Sun\") from Season One is also a standout.Which begs the question: Why hasn't \"The Walking Dead\" received any Emmy nominations outside of Best Prosthetic Makeup, Visual Effects and Sound? AMC has become the HBO of basic cable with shows such as \"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad.\" James should have received a nod for Best Guest Actor in a Drama. Several cast members, writers and directors should have earned Emmy recognition. Lincoln put heart and soul into a Shakespearean-like mad scene this season that played through several episodes. How about \"The Walking Dead\" as Best Drama, ok? The show isn't about zombies; it's about survivors. Metaphorically, it's about people who battle through the worst of times.Additional extras include eight short featurettes. \"Rising Son\" tracks the growth of young Chandler Riggs in his role of Carl Grimes, or what's it like to grow up during the Zombie Apocalypse. Riggs packs power and pathos into the role with astonishing maturity.\"Gone, But Not Forgotten,\" salutes a character lost during Season Three; \"Evil Eye,\" examines The Governor, showing how the character evolved from Kirkman's comic book to screen and Morrissey's take on him; \"Heart of a Warrior\" focuses on Michonne and actress Danai Gurira, who brings her to life, while \"Michonne vs. The Governor,\" explores that relationship, and \"Safety Behind Bars\" highlights the biggest set of Season Three. \"Making the Dead\" and \"Guts and Glory\" provides a short demonstration of makeup and effects.Give \"The Walking Dead\" a chance, if your taste runs to suspense, chilly thrills, and realistic characters to love and hate.Season Four premiers at 9 p.m. Oct. 13 on AMC."
B009FZFONO I think the first two seasons had more draw and events to them. I dislike the loss of certain characters but that is part of the story. The ending does not leave you hanging as much as the others so I have less desire or anticipation to see more."
B009FZFONO I loved season 1 and greatly disappointed in season 2 (too much stupid middle school drama and not enough zombies), and had reservations about season 3. If the rest of the season is as good as episode 1, season 3 could be better than season 1! Lots of zombies, good sets and just the right amount of drama, realistic and approtriate without being silly or boring. I'm looking forward to a good season."
B009FZFONO I love this show.  Not only is it entertaining but I have picked up a few apocolyptic survival tips. I sure hope there is going to be a season 4, this show is the only reason I got cable.  ;0)"
B009FZFONO Such an intriguing show with create character development and nonstop action. The show very gory, so if you are squeamish, this might not be the show for you. We started season 1 two weeks ago and were so hooked we watch season 1 and 2 and now are on 3. I can hardly wait until the next episode, they always leave you guessing!"
B009FZFONO Love the surpises and relationships.  Great series.  A drama based on relationships of people you grow to care about.  You get involved in their struggles and cheer them on."
B009FZFONO Each season gets more and more exciting, can't stop watching !! My family and I just love it, especially my teanage daughter."
B009FZFONO There is nothing boring about flesh eating zombies when they are created in such a way as to draw you into the reality of their nightmare universe. There are a lot of zombie movies. So far each one of these installments is as good as the best of these movies. There is no problem creating dramatic tension when, in any scene and at any time in any scene, flesh eating zombies can crash the party, but making us buy into the zombies in the first instance is brilliantly done and a dorky zombie portrayal can break the spell - hasn't happened yet."
B009FZFONO i love everything about this show, the whole zombie thing is hard to pull off these days but this show does it brilliantly"
B009FZFONO Story lines are engaging but not in boring, monotonous detail.  Characters are interesting and believable.  Season finale was anti-climatic but the show is still gre
B009FZFONO I can't say enough about the Walking Dead show.  It is new, well-written, and completely different from anything already on TV.  I am completely hooked.  I felt it was worth it to buy the third season so I could watch it while waiting for the new season to debut.  The product itself was fine and I am very satisfied."
B009FZFONO The characters just get better as time goes along. Leaner, harder, survivors. At this point I think they are becoming barely sane."
B009FZFONO Oh my God! This series is really scary. I had to stop the viewing and go to something else, some of the scenes really scared me. It is very well done because you feel like you are present in the action. Not your typical zombie show. Very well developed characters and stories. It feels real and that it's why it is so frightening and popular. I could not stop watching it. It really grabs your attention.If you like well done horror, this is it."
B009FZFONO This is a wonderful series and never disappoints! I am really looking forward to season 4. I am really invested in these characters."
B009FZFONO I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely. I'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with, too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just doesn't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy. But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it's believable, intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it. And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem-inducing moments. (If you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about)Season 2 was equally great, more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and/or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT HERE - But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought, \"Uh-oh, am I going to even like Season 3?\" Granted while Shane wasn't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group. It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated, frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend, Rick. It's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that's what happened to Shane and then Rick, every the shining hero put an end to Shane's life. And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too. This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring. I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing. A kickbutt woman with a katana? How cool will that be, right?And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing...boredom. Sadly Michonne's character is taking forever to develop and sorry, but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me. I know Michonne's a strong, silent warrior type, but I don't know why since she's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it's place in t
B009FZFONO I love the walking dead. Best tv series ever. We never miss an episode. We always down load on to the kindle fire the next day."
B009FZFONO The group moves to a prison, they introduce this character called &#34;The Governor&#34;.  Darryl really comes into his own as the badassed zombie slayer.  Must see."
B009FZFONO This series are pretty good. The special effects are great for a TV show. Besides buying the shows in Amazon, we are buying the blurays."
B009FZFONO Love it! you never knew what traumatic event was going to happen next. Keeps you on your toes for sure!."
B009FZFONO My problem with Season 2 of \"The Walking Dead\" is that it dragged and dragged and DRAGGED. Not the case with Season 3! Wow, so much happens this season and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. I won't give away any spoilers, but just know that NO ONE is safe and every single character can and very well may die at any given moment, which is one of the things that makes this show so great. Also, the additions of two new characters this season, Michonne and the infamous Governor, are not to be missed. Both actors bring amazing depth to their characters and really make this season of the show the best yet. Can't wait for Season 4!"
B009FZFONO Wonderful show! Gritty and gruesome and compelling. I can watch each episode as many times as I want, right on my computer!"
B009FZFONO Great TV series depend on a group of actors with real chemistry plus compelling situations. It doesn't get more compelling than zombies, and the actors in Walking Dead are, by now, family."
B009FZFONO This is the best show of the last decade....well including Game of Thrones.  Not else more I can say.  I'm soo glad this season is waayyyy better than the second season."
B009FZFONO I think that when the writers introduced the character \"Michonne\" to the cast of the Walking Dead it did SO much to create and renergize this show.  Every time I see her in action, chopping off heads of the dead with that kick-butt sword and basically creating a this one woman army against the army of the dead... I just get such a kick out of her personality and character performance.Michonne reminds me so much of Uma Thurman in \"Kill Bill,\" which is one of my most favorite kung fu flicks, when I watch her in action.  I have a feeling MANY of you out there that love this show really dig her too.  You cannot but love this quite yet physical woman.  She is Xena, Black Mamba (Kiddo), and Wonder Woman all in one.SPOILER:  I just got through watching \"HOME\" and I was thinking to myself of how the action was getting a bit slow, but then the writers blow me away again with the attack on the prison and I find myself once again gripped by the drama and action pack fighting and the brutal struggle against not only the dead but the wretchedness of Woodbury's governor!Can't wait until next episode, I have a feeling its time for revenge against the Governor's well armed town.  And just between us, I think Michonne is very, VERY fond of Andrea and would not be at all surprised to find out she confesses her feelings for her later in the season. Could be wrong though?Keep the drama coming AMC and well done with casting Michonne!  =)Thanks for reading my review."
B009FZFONO This is one of my all time favorite shows. It has action and drama and strong characers. At this point and the next episode the crew is fighting to survive and must battle their way into a prison full of zombies. The action is tense and the effects gory as you would expect from this show. There isn't much room for deep character discussions like the ones you saw in season 2, but we know these characters very well by now. I am sure they will have a slower one around the bend sometime. But maybe not. At least we get 8 episodes , then a break and 8 more. But in reality something this popular could go for a twenty ep run easily! The acting is as strong as ever and that's a big plus."
B009FZFONO In my opinion this is the best show on TV.  Sometimes the storyline seems to drag but there are so many characters that I think the writers did a very good job because of that.  I also love how many &#34;walkers&#34; get shot each episode and then add in the human versus human element and it makes for good viewing, at least for me.  I don't want to give away to much of the plot lines that is why I am not being more specific."
B009FZFONO This may well have been one of the best seasons ever as the plot thickens.  I can't wait for Season Four."
B009FZFONO I liked the first season and the next two do not disappoint you. My husband really likes this tv show."
B009FZFONO 1 escapism? no2 boring dialog yes3 whiny characters that don't react with anything like realism? yep4 evil white men and mindless hicss vs women and minorities? yep5 any sense of danger from zombies no6 plot with no coherence? yep7 enjoyable at all? naaaa"
B009FZFONO What can i say?  If you dont like The Walking Dead, then something is wrong with you!  Such an awesome show...and im waiting on the remainder of season 3 to finally start up again."
B009FZFONO The writing gets better and better -not weaker and desperate. It's nice to see the life hasn't left the Walking Dead yet!"
B009FZFONO Started watching Walking Dead because I follow Chris Hardwick's Nerdist podcasts and pretty much enjoy most everything he gets nerdy over so I thought I had to at least give it a chance since he was such a huge fan w/his Talking Dead show. I watched Season 1 & 2 on Netflix in just two days and was so hooked I started paying for each episode on Season 3 via Amazon Prime... it was REALLY hard to wait for new episodes once I caught up with the season about mid-way through. I do not consider myself a big horror fan but this show is different (like everyone else says), the pace is basically perfect, and what I really like is all the twists and turns the characters take, and that no character is ever truly safe in this war zone like, zombie apocalypse world... no random red shirt appearances on this show for sure and every character whether you love 'em or hate 'em, well you never know how long they have!I do wish Amazon carried The Talking Dead after show as well. We haven't had cable for a year now and between Netflix, Hulu+ and Amazon Prime streaming/purchasing I am all set and only pay for the shows that really matter to me, like this one! Can NOT wait until Season 4! Seriously, you are missing an historic TV phenomenon if you aren't watching the Walking Dead!"
B009FZFONO I have enjoyed TWD since I watched the first episode.  I haven't read the Graphic Novel version (I want to be totally surprised!).  This third season has had its ups and downs (no spoilers), but, for the most part, I could not have asked for a more realistically aimed series.  The fights are good, the zombies provide more than just a background, but they are not the all-over theme.  The drama with the main characters is.  They have enough sub plots going on that you stay interested, but don't get confused.  I am looking forward to the season finale this round as I want to see what they came up with.  Also, looking very much forward to season IV?"
B009FZFONO Just keeps me guessing over and over. plot change direction very quickly. Has me waiting for whats next. This is the kind of show you can watch and then come back a month or 2 later and its new because yo see what you missed."
B009FZFONO I love The Walking Dead! I got into it late in the game, which was lucky, in my opinion, because I got to watch all three seasons in about 4 days. Now in Season 4, it is an eternity to wait for the new episode to come out!Difficult to start this series anywhere other than the beginning as there is a lot of background that carries over.You will either be a fan or you won't. The story is not always exciting -- but hang on and you'll love it!"
B009FZFONO This movie is constant action always something to look forward to all the rest. Can not wait to see whats next."
B009FZFONO He said - you'll like this as much as BSG, but it's so very cool and different.  I was skeptical, but after watching a marathon of the original mini-series...I am hooked and thinkn the writing and acting is excellent.  The &#34;Mayor&#34; character is starting to annoy me, but I'll wait to see where the writers/producers take the show this season."
B009FZFONO I love this show. Have been watching since season 1. It has ups, downs, emotional days and lots of zombie brains flying everywhere but most of all I believe this show teaches about survival and team work in order to survive."
B009FZFONO This is the best.  I canrt wait for new episodes.  I am engaged in the characters and the plot.  The zombies almost seem secondary...almost."
B009FZFONO With the Prison now coming into play, we see the group start making a new home.  We see Carl do something no child should ever have to do.  And we see..Andrea fall in love, at least that's the way it seems, with a man who could bring the group down to it's knees.A great third Season!"
B009FZFONO If you haven't watched the show, don't expect it to be just about zombies. It has a great story to it. I think it's very accurate on how the apocalypse would be. How sick and demented people would be left to ruin the last bit of humanity."
B009FZFONO Love it!! The price was great and Season 3 added to my &#34;collection&#34;.  The DVD series is a &#34;must have&#34; for any fan of The Walking Dead.  Originally a gift, decided to keep for myself - Definitely recommend!"
B009FZFONO This is my favorite show to watch every week. I was never a zombie movie fan but I do like watching the group go through their struggles each week just to stay alive."
B009FZFONO As the series goes on it becomes apparent, that you are watching the greatest zombie apocalypse based film work of all time (IMHO), and like all great shows ********SPOILER ALERT AHEAD********* (see the final season/episodes of Breaking Bad) no character is safe from death or injury, you know like in real life, where stuff happens to even the best of us. Shows without real consequences for major characters don't interest me. This show delivers on the promise of even the good have to go, and isn't afraid to take out anyone no matter how many fans love them or not. Story telling is front and foremost here, if it fits the story then off they go, no cliffhangers that always seem to rescue the major characters (Grey's Anatomy I'm pointing my finger at you and your plane crash, yes a couple of characters die but not one of the originals went anywhere). No Red Shirts here everyone is fair game. If you haven't seen the show from the beginning do yourself a favor check out the major streaming services and catch up quick it comes back October 13th."
B009FZFONO When was the last time this show was scary?  The biters have become mere pests. They are no longer a real threat. Little Carl is much more frightening.  By Episode 13 of Season 3, dealing with the Zs has deteriorated into a game. When the zombies are treated like gnats, it's time to play the theme from \"Jaws.\"  Dudes, the shark has been jumped.And what's with all this yakking. Is this The Talking Dead?  Episode 13 seems to be where things are bottoming out. Not one real fright in the hour. Rick and the Governor, still battling it out for Who is Nuttier, are at a sitdown at the behest of Andrea, a woman who can't see the forest or the trees. Her boyfriend keeps his zombie daughter in the breakfront, has a collection of living zombie heads in the parlor, stages gladiator fights with zombies, and she doesn't get it that he's a little, you know, odd?Anyway, the episode starts out reasonably well: Old Herschel is along as Rick's protection because when the going gets tough, there isnothing like an elderly one-legged man to provide back up, right?  But intriguingly, he has a gun and a knife strapped to his stump. Points for originality. And the Guv has a gun hidden under the sit-down table.  Okay, looks like we are going to have some action...the conflict will be resolved and one of the boys won't be going home. Yeah...dream on.  Rick and the Governor stare at one another meaningfully.  For minutes on end. And they talk. And they talk and they talk. Come on...we are not watching this show for the dramatic insights into their characters, we know the governor is insane and is determined to wipe out Rick's people, so why watch him pretend otherwise for most of the episode?  Enough dialogue...we want action, chills, terror. Otherwise we'd be watching some hip Indie film with Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. And when some Zs do show up, dispatching them is almost an afterthought.  Enter the shark.In addition to Rick and Guv's talk fest, other even more boring characters are highlighted.  Maggie and Glenn do their best to turn this into As The Zombie Turns as they examine where their relationship went wrong and then have a little gratuitous sex to keep those teenage boys tuning in.  Glenn is my least favorite character. He gets everything wrong and, when left in charge of the prison, decides to abandon his post and have a make out session with his galpal instead.  Ah, young love.  If a zombie singles him out, I will gladly provide condiments.Merle, the one-armed psychopath, is the only one who makes sense, wanting to take out the governor by sneaking up on him and whacking him. But the politcally correct Glenn won't stand for this. Another reason to dislike the little squirt.The show is becoming painful.  Let's have some more chills. I want the Walking Dead to scare me to death, not bore me to death. For a show that started out so well...the first episode was enough to induce nightmares, it's now a parody.  Please, please, scare the daylights out of us again. Make the biters scary again, not just little flies to annoy and be swatted away.  This may be the problem...the make up people have so many great ideas for creating rotted corpses, they have overdone it. Too many zombies and we get too used to them.  One zombie shuffling toward you in the dark, arms outstretched, coming at you slowly  but inexorably as you look around and see no way out...that's terrifying. But endless swarms of them shambling along and getting their poor little noggins busted over and over and over again?  Not so much.  Give us the Horror. Give us the Zombies...not the zzzzzzzzzzz."
B009FZFONO This was an awesome episode!  That final scene was so intense and well-acted by (the character) Rick.  I'm so glad they went that direction and it definitely has us wondering what will happen next."
B009FZFONO I'm not much for horror / gore but this character driven show is the exception.  I turn my  head through the really gory parts so I can watch the development of these complicated characters. Great show!"
B009FZFONO Season 3 of The Walking Dead simply blew two out of the water, if you ignore the very very lackluster finale. That was the only disappointment to an otherwise wonderful season. The build up and things done in the finale were just mediocre at best, especially the Andrea crap. But otherwise it was a wonderful season I'll sure be watching a few times."
B009FZFONO A tale of two cities at odds.  A beloved character resurfaces as a peacemaker.  The characters establish a fortifiable home and develop further."
B009FZFONO The characters are so well developed and even though the Zombie killings are totally gruesome, I can't help but watch how they kill them.  They are so creative in the methods.  Can't wait from week to week in regard to what's going to happen next.  The tension between Rick and the Governor is really something to watch."
B009FZFONO At this point in the series, everybody in the group is hardened to the world around them. Nobody hesitates anymore, and they work great together as a team. At the end of the lst episode, we were greeted by a few new characters, namely some convicts in the prison who had holed up in the cafeteria. Well, basically, this episode highlighted just how cohesive and necessarily ruthless Rick and the group could be when their survival is one the line (which it is every day). There was one scene in particular, prefaced by the quote, \"I know....s#$% happens.\" Well...no doubt about that. Probably my second favorite scene after the bar scene in the episode \"Nebraska\" from last season. This show went from crazy uncertainty to idle development, but now we're in hardcore mode and I am loving it. Dirty, gritty, and necessarily violent. Everything I hoped it could be, and this episode lived up to that.Enjoy!"
B009FZFONO I love this show! :0) I LOVE the caharacter, Daryl Dixon. The whole cast is great, but Norman Reedus's character, Darly stands out above the rest, even though he is not the main character.....Daryl is a true meaning to the word HERO!  I love every part of this show, except the baby's name, Judith...that sound like an elderly librarian name. The could of given the baby a better name, even Lil' Asskicker (Daryl's nickname for the baby) sounds better than Judith."
B009FZFONO Season 3 is probably a step-up from the previous season filled with more action, more suspense, more storyline and more gore. We are introduced to new characters such as Michonne, The Governor, Axel, Oscar, Tyrese, Sasha, and many others. We say good-bye to series regulars as these characters meet a tragic end. Rick and his group find a prison overrun with zombies. They take it and make it their home. Meanwhile, Andrea and Michonne find the town of Woodbury, led by the corrupt Governor. When one of the major characters dies, Rick slowly loses his mind and must care for his newborn baby girl. Soon, a territorial battle escalates and Rick must step up and lead his group through it if they want to survive not only the zombies, but the living who want what's theirs. I highly recommend THE WALKING DEAD: SEASON 3!!!"
B009FZFONO I was eagerly awaiting the first season of The Walking Dead as everyone was. And it looked like it was going to be one hell of a ride after the pilot episode, which was directed by Frank Darabont, a fabulous director who gave us two brilliant films, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both superb movies. And Darabont's directing of the first episode of season 1 is brilliant. But by episode 2 something seems to slack off a bit. It's actually still a great episode but it's missing the director of the pilot, and though it's subtle you can feel it. By the third episode things actually start to feel underproduced compared to the pilot and it feels more like a soapish sort of style, with a lot of time, too much time getting to know all the character and their lives and all that goes with it. But there simply isn't a lot of action or zombies through much of season 1 on through till the final episode, which is interesting, but I kept waiting for the magic I saw in the pilot to continue onward, it didn't  happen and I was left feeling that season 1 was 
B009FZFONO The show comes out sunday night, we get it monday morning, a fair deal that makes my monday night all the more zombie-riffic."
B009FZFONO WD kills it again.  This season added a completely new element by the addition of &#34;the governor&#34;.  In fact he became the character you love to hate.  I didn't know who I hated more: the governor or Joffrey from Game of Thrones.  In any case, there is some real drama in this season and even tenser moments than seasons past.  Don't try to guess who lives or dies because you will probably be wrong anyway."
B009FZFONO Best show on,Tv dont miss out on a great tv show if u havent seen it start from season 1"
B009FZFONO I just can't wait to watch it every week. I have never seen a series like this. I even watch that annoying little guy in the discussion group &#34;talking dead&#34; that comes after the show. This is my favorite of all time series."
B009FZFONO Love this show, makes you wander how we would handle worldwide disaster. They kill off characters quickly so hard to get to liking one then they are gone"
B009FZFONO Season 1, Great.....Season 2, Wow..Better...!  Season 3.......Hard to believe, but Much, Much, Better.....! This is Hands down, The best Show on TV."
B009FZFONO The wife and I did not think we would enjoy this show as much as we have. We are not horror/zombie fans, but the writing of the show, the actors, and the drama gets you interested and after a while you aren't really fazed by the zombie gore."
B009FZFONO This show is terribly addictive! I had heard about if from some friends and gave them the &#34;whateve&#34; eye roll. Then I watched the first episode. Great! I've been strung out like a junky ever since. I can't wait for the next episode."
B009FZFONO I recommend this show Very much so !! One of the Best shows out there !! You must watch it from the very beganing. Don't doubt me. Watch it !!"
B009FZFONO Non-stop action and great special effects. Going into a prison was pure genius. We get a new character and all the returning characters are somewhat different from last season. Carl is a bad ass and Daryl is now second in command. Hersel aged quite a bit. Rick is no longer bonding with his wife and Carol is horny for Daryl. Glen and Maggie continue their romance. Can't wait until episode #2 - more new characters and more of the fabulous Prison set. Please do more with T-Dog. There is potential there and his role in the group has always been on the back burner."
B009FZFONO I wonder who teaches the male actors, the guy who plays the Shane character especially, how to do facial and head acting? My point: This guy Jon is pathetic with his dipping his head, cocking it to one side, his body postures - and no, this is not the character, but Jon's acting. Jon was so overwhelmingly melo-dramatic that I comsidered him a rookie given a chance at the big leagues. His silly acting got in the way of the story. Too many of the actors are too obvious in their stud acting. Superiors actors could have made the series worth the money spent. Superior actors, though, would not have participated. I suggest that one pay $1.00 per episode. No more than $1.00. But, be prepared for silly acting too often from Jon who plays Shane. The director created a silly and immature character in the boy, so much so that it is impossible to believe. Therefore, a primary character of the final several episodes are fluff. I say that about 50% of the episodes are worth watching, which is saying that the other episodes are fluff to make up some extra dollars. The fluff will make one laugh though. Again, each episode is worth $1.00 each, no more."
B009FZFONO I Loved the first season and was surprised at how the second season ended. I am looking forward to this season."
B009FZFONO Engrossing and gross at the same time; they spare no expense on make-up or special effects; a simple and overdone high story, it's the bottom story that creates the intrigue. They've taken what George Romero did in the 1960's and polished it for an audience in 2012. It is 'wicked' good."
B009FZFONO I wish the season was a bit longer. This show is awesome. The graphics are great and the story line is great as well. I would recommmend watching the frist two seasons before watching this one."
B009FZFONO I really enjoy this show and all the creative talent involved. I really think that they have recaptured the classic Zombie genre that has been so elusive as of late for other film makers."
B009FZFONO Episode 16, \"Welcome to the tombs\", shows us how far this series has sunk, from what used to be hilarious, grisly, suspenseful, and original. Now we have the worst horror-movie cliche, a \"heroine\" who will be fine if she just hurries up, but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets...eaten. We don't care about Andrea anyway, because Laurie Holden's trout pout is too hard to look at, and her character's predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity: she just can't see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath, even though it's obvious to everyone else. We, the audience, keep seeing things before she does, and then we're supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her! In this latest example, Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton, the Governor's assistant who is about to die and turn, and then will try to eat Andrea. Milton, still barely alive, urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself, so she can mercy-kill him and escape, before the Governor returns with his strike force. There is every reason here for extreme speed. Death sits across the room from her and the Governor cannot be far behind. Never was it more important to keep one's mind on the task at hand (freeing oneself) and get the hell out of dodge. All Andrea has to do is hurry. But she indulges in long, tragic looks, tries to philosophize with Milton, forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions, and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive. So of course, Zombie Milton gets her. But there is no meaning to it, because she LET it happen! Then we have some more drawn-out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die. Sad music, long stares, reverence. And we're supposed to see her as the \"Noble Soul who only wanted people to live\". Walking Dead is starting to get Smallville Disease, where the characters spend all their time bloviating about the Deep Inspiring Meaning of what is happening, but there is no story. Someone needs to reboot this series."
B009FZFONO Best show on Television, hands down! Great writing and plot development drive this character based drama. The zombie killing is just icing on an already delicious cake."
B009FZFONO This is one of those great series that I can't wait to see the next episode of. Not everybody likes zombie apocalyptic tales, but in my opinion this series is great entertainment."
B009FZFONO This is a little different this season, with the group having to deal with actual thinking &#34;bad guys&#34;. Makes the plot more interesting and who thinks up this stuff??? 2 slaves without jaws and arms as a defense tactic. Twisted!"
B009FZFONO I must find out what happens next. I want to see if the baby grows up to become just as heartless a killer as her brother is."
B009FZFONO And he can hardly wait to turn on the download whenever he comes to my house. Me, I'm not as interested in being scared by zombies, but the story line keeps developing which indicates that the creativity behind this series is very good."
B009FZFONO I love the show, but I miss Shane's out of the box thinking. I think the group should head to Stamford, Ct. to find out who is the baby daddy."
B009FZFONO Should I be worried that the zombies don't bother me at all after 2 full seasons? ;-) ;-)  Great season premiere.  A good set up for another few months of nail biting action."
B009FZFONO Season 3 is the best of The Walking Dead to date.  The first episode is nothing but action that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Highly recommended."
B009FZFONO This has become one of my favorite TV shows since they have taken the zombie genre and crashed past its limits in a truly explosive fashion. This started as a survival horror show, in which the people were pretty much trying to stay alive while avoiding the walkers, but it has morphed into so much more. In this season, the zombies are still there, but they have pretty much become part of the scenery. Yes, they are still dangerous and become a problem in cases, but the much bigger threat comes from other humans. We have the old issues rising up in this new world, where greed, self-interest and the us vs. them mentality rules the day.One of the aspects of this series I enjoy the most is the growth of the characters, especially Rich, who by virtue of being the leader of his group has to not only think about his immediate family, but also his extended one. This leads him to make many decisions that go against what he used to believe in when he was a cop in his previous life, and the effects are sometimes dramatic. As has been the case previously, the creators of the series have no qualms in killing off important characters, so you'd be best served to not get too attached to any of them in particular. I thoroughly enjoy this level of uncertainty when watching a series.Having been reading the graphic novel too, I really like how they have changed the story in the TV series. This has pretty much given me two zombie stories instead of one repeated across two different mediums. Some of the basic elements of the plot are similar, but the characters, who dies and who lives, and how certain key stories develop are all different. If you have not checked out the graphic novel do yourself a favor and try it out too.I am looking forward to the 4th season of this series, it cannot come fast enough!"
B009FZFONO love the walking dead but they should do it from how it got stared and who did it from the get go how did it spread in the air"
B009FZFONO Once you have watched the two seasons, this third season is a must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's complicated relationships based in a zombie land that is addicting to watch!"
B009FZFONO If you haven't given up on the show by now then you'll be pleasantly surprised by what season three has to offer."
B009FZFONO well written and suspenseful cant wait to see the rest of the season. It is much better with the different writers"
B009FZFONO Great storyline. The actors were chosen for their roles very well.  Even though it is about zombies it's well written and well acted."
B009FZFONO All time favorite show- one episode and you are hooked !  best to watch from season 1 so you understand it all. and Darryl Dixon yumm  &#60;3  :p"
B009FZFONO I understand this might not be for everyone but ... has an excellent story line ! great characters! and the zombies are excellent! I am completely hooked!"
B009FZFONO I have been watching The Walking Dead since season 1!!  I love all of them. I keep watching them over and over.  It is cool to see how the people are coping with what has happened.  How Rick has changed since it first started, and it is so realistic.  Dont have enough words. It keeps getting better!!"
B009FZFONO This is a really entertaining show!  Not for the faint of heart though.  Lots of action and excitement, even a little romance."
B009FZFONO Everybody loves &#34;Walking Dead&#34;.  Great production values.  Tremendous acting for SF/horror series.I especially enjoy Glenn and Maggie - a great couple.  Guess the premise got a little tired for me this season."
B009FZFONO Remember the scene where Carl got shot? Remember when Rick turned that corner on the horse in the city? Remember the CDC, the interstate when the herd came through.....any scene that Shane was in?This is no longer that show. If all they've got is a guy mowing down a crowd with a gun then screw them. Even the Merle situation seemed rushed and contrived.The dynamics that Shane and Dale brought - gone. The interesting path Andrea was on - gone. Now she's a g-stringed girlfriend - oh wait now she's dead too. Merle's great presence and the potential for his character - gone. They brought the cool black guy with the dramatic British theatrical training and the greatest southern accent ever from the first season back just so you could watch him quickly disappear into useless madness and find out that his awesome kid died.All that remains is a lukewarm crowd of people waiting for Rick to give orders - even Daryl - with some moodiness and bitchiness occurring throughout from what's left of the uninteresting group.The governor - the actor totally unconvincing.All my favorite characters are dead - no longer anticipated the next episode. It's a dead show as far as I'm concerned."
B009FZFONO I started out loving the show even though I had to hide my eyes during the gory scenes (and there are LOTS) of them. But when many of the most interesting characters died, I just couldn't watch anymore. It became a downer for me, as if there were no hope for anyone. Ever."
B009FZFONO This series is addicting.  LOTS of GORE, blood, guts, hanging flesh, people being eaten by zombies, it's not a show for the faint at heart.  But suspenceful and the character development is excellent!"
B009FZFONO Still following the show pretty well.  Still surprised by the character development and story twist that pull me into the show."
B009FZFONO Zombies!  Guns!  People!  Kind of a great combination.  The producers still manage to keep the show interesting, which is pretty hard given that there are mainly 3 combinations of interactions: people killing zombies, zombies killing people, or people killing people.  Kudos to the producers for making the show last till a 3rd season!"
B009FZFONO This is the best season of Walking Dead so far. Fast moving plot with twists and turns, never letting up. Thank you for ending the stupid banter scenes in season 2!"
B009FZFONO A great improvement over Season 2.  While it ended well, I nearly gave up on it and am happy its picking up again. I loved the comics and while it loosely follows it, it was its own series from the beginning and does it well."
B009FZFONO This was a decent season, but, as I'm sure many other reviewers have said, it strayed pretty far off of the canon.  I appreciate that the show and the books have their subtle differences, but if this had been left off as it had at the end of season 3, it would have become a completely different story.  I'm glad season 4 got the show back on track to make it feel like a true Walking Dead story again."
B009FZFONO best show on tv it s #1 ........ and number 2 is not even close.  each episode gets better and better never a let down. cant wait to see what is next"
B009FZFONO If you like zombie films or video games, this is a great show.  Season 3 continues the great story started in the first two seasons.  The excitement and suspense continue to grow.  This is a well-made, well-produced show and has great acting."
B009FZFONO Fantastic, creative, spellbinding, this has it all. I am looking forward to the second half of this season coming back very soon."
B009FZFONO The show is very intense, but this season seemed to go against one of the main themes that made it interesting; survival at any cost. It was a different dynamic to be certain but took away from the intensity and turned it into a stupid drama."
B009FZFONO This is a great show. Good special effects but more important, it has an interesting and intensifying plot. The cast also changes randomly to keep it from getting stale."
B009FZFONO A must see  if you love the series ! Can't wait for the second half of season. Purchased from Amazon...so cool...NO COMMERCIALS !"
B009FZFONO I definitely don't love this show.  I'm hooked though.  The show is progressing so slow.  I just wish they would ratchet up the action and/or drama.  This season has taken quite a while to get rolling.  Lately, I've found it difficult to stay awake.  But dammit, I'm still compelled to watch."
B009FZFONO I started watching it a few weeks ago and watched every episode in just two weeks. It's really well written, the acting is top notch and despite the subject matter it is actually not that gory. Love it."
B009FZFONO Gonna have to buy more episodesMy family and I love this show it is a great show that we all love to watch."
B009FZFONO This show will suck you in the moment you start watching. We can't get enough and can't wait for the next season on Prime!"
B009FZFONO Zombies, undead or just people with really bad skin conditions...who cares? the show is about the survivors and how they manage to get along in the post apocalyptic world. So many layers to the story. I don't have cable, but yet, i manage to fork 1.99 per episode for this show. Why? it's a good show!"
B009FZFONO We Love this show wish it never ended, new eposide every week. Can't wait till next season, hope the storyline stays strong"
B009FZFONO With the highest body count of any episode to date, the gore hounds will love this one. The episode does a several month fast forward--Lori is visibly pregnant--and hunger is a problem for the survivors. There is a scene involving a can of dog food that really sparked a conversation in our home. The AMC sync even had a question about whether or not it was right for Rick to stop Karl from eating it...surprisingly, almost 70% of the poll agreed. I'm sorry, but lack of protein and starvation opens up a lot of menu choices.One thing is clear, Rick is the leader of the band and his word is law. Karl has obviously been learning on the fly and is actually a help instead of the errant child of last season. (The best thing about that is that now we can focus on despising Lori for other things.)There is minimal dialog in this episode. The characters have to carry the episode with expressions and body language. I highly recommend watching this episode more than once just to observe how expertly these people stay in character. There is a great moment between Daryl and Carol that breaks the tension and earns some laughs.The early dilemma besides food is Lori's soon-to-arrive &#34;bundle of joy&#34;. The possibility of having the baby on the run is not appealing. When they stumble upon the prison, there is a belief that they have found refuge. All that remains is to clear it out. My only problem with that sequence was the number of blind corners. It leads to great suspense, but prisons are all about big open spaces and long, straight corridors.We get a peek at Michonne. She is on the move with Andrea, who is suffering from the flu or some similar ailment. It is clear that they have built a bond during their time since meeting in the woods at the end of season two.The effects are, as always, top notch. The best thing I saw was the return towards the storyline that those of us who read the graphic novels came to love.Naturally, the episode ends with a dramatic event. I don't think that this series needs to use hooks any longer. The fan base isn't leaving.Let's hope that this is what we have to look forward to in season three. For many, the second season was just a bit flat at times until the final two episodes.The episode one ending introduced us to some potential new characters...a group of inmates holed up in the prison cafeteria. Surprisingly, they turn out to be a &#34;less-than-desirable&#34; group. I was actually surprised that Rick tolerated them as long as he did. When things go sour--one particular inmate makes an obvious attempt on Rick in the chaos--Rick doesn't delegate to Daryl, and instead, gets the nomination for the &#34;Tom Savini Machete Kill of the Year&#34;. If that moment was not a direct nod to the original Dawn of the Dead, then it is the best unintentional homage ever!One of the most entertaining lines of the show has to fall into a similar category. There is no secret that Lori is possibly the most hated woman on television. She has been a regular &#34;bad Mother&#34; poster on an almost episodic basis. I believe that fans of the show got a &#34;We love you&#34; note from the writers and producers when Lori, during a scene with Rick, says, &#34;Look, I know that I'm a shitty wife...and I'm not winning any Mother-of-the-Year awards...&#34; Truer words were never spoken...Concerns over Hershel continue, and one of the best &#34;Made ya jump&#34; moments involves him and Lori. It is nice that Kirkman and company took a little veer off of the normal zombie track and allow for the possibility of survival of the area can be amputated (a fact that will be the doom for one of the inmates). Romero fans all recall the arm amputation scene from Day of the Dead.The honorary Boy Scout award goes to Carol. It is almost like taking a look back in time to when medicine was in its infancy. Before people were allowed to donate their bodies to science and grave-robbers were making a lucrative business delivering cadavers to would-be healers, the human body was a real mystery.In closing, with Rick's new attitude, how many people think that maybe he and Shane were really two peas in a pod. There is a harsh side to the aspect of survival that Shane understood from day one. His only downfall was his obsession with Lori.Overall, episode two hits the ground running and offers a few new &#34;questions&#34;...like who was watching Carol from the bushes...and where are Andrea and Michonne?Season 3, episode 3...or &#34;Merle, is that a knife in your pocket...or are you just glad to see me?&#34; Yes, there was little doubt that Merle would resurface. Honestly, as a fan of the graphic novels, I figured that he would become &#34;The Governor&#34;. Instead, they decided to give us a Ted Bundy type instead of the blatantly obvious bad guy.I must admit that I watch the AMC Storysync with each episode during its premiere. When questions come up like &#34;SHould Andrea and Michonne stay or leave, and a quarter of the voters pick &#34;Stay&#34;, then I have to wonder what the hell show they are watching. Whether or not you have read the series is irrelevant, The Governor drips evil. How is anybody missing that?This episode is all about Andrea and Michonne arriving at Woodbury. Now this tiny community of 73 (soon to be 74) citizens is just waiting to be exposed as a haven for evil. The question that remains is how many of the citizens are &#34;in on it.&#34; With Merle walking around free (but seemingly very much under the thumb of The Governor if you pay close attention to one scene) and a man in a dark lab performing experiments on the walkers (or biters as the Woodbury people call them), you just know the facade will have to crack.Right now, Michonne seems to be the only one keeping a healthy distrust. Andrea is either playing The Governor, or she is starting to sip from the Kool-Aid. That remains to be seen. However, if there is any doubt about The Governor, that is put to rest in the end. As an owner of several aquariums...I was a little put off by his collection."
B009FZFONO This definitely has to be my current favorite show.  I love the way they use the moral dilemmas to pull the watcher into the action!"
B009FZFONO Read the review title, says pretty much everything.  They seem to be getting worse vs better in figuring out this content delivery process.  A few more issues like this week, I'm rethinking prime."
B009FZFONO The Walking Dead is a phenomenal zombie TV series. My entire family really enjoys watching this show together. Scary stuff, sometimes funny stuff, lots of surprises, and it never disappoints us."
B009FZFONO My husband and I love this show. We have 2 children so when it is time to watch this show it is our time. It is amazing love it. What more can I say."
B009FZFONO This has become a soap opera more for 10 year olds with all their love of horror, blood, and gore. The first season was good, but from the second season on...it has sunk so low there is no saving it now. I've cancelled the rest of the season and won't be watching any further. What a disappointment for something that could have gone a whole nother way and been really great."
B009FZFONO Best zombie flic ever!!!  Never been into zombie movies...too corny, usually.  Absolutely hooked!  Never want it to end!  I managed to get everyone i know completely addicted to it.  Even dropped dish network when they temporarily dropped amc.  Willing to pay per episode just so i don't miss a thing."
B009FZFONO It's amazing that \"The Walking Dead\" didn't become a zombie with all the creative turn over in the last three years. The fact that it is continuing to roll out exceptional episodes is a credit to the creative crew and cast (including creator and co-producer Robert Kirkman). The third season is no exceptional with some startling developments for Rick and the other survivors. Having watched the show on AMC, I'm going to focus more on the quality of the Blu-ray rather than discuss (in detail) the changes in the plot for the third season. There is a brief synopsis below and there are some some minor spoilers in that paragraph.SPOILERS:Rick (Andrew Lincoln) loses it during the third season of \"The Walking Dead\" and the group isn't quite sure what to do with him. The group have found a \"home\"--a prison that, while it provides security, has its own challenges. The third season features a number of stunning changes including personal losses for a number of characters in the show. We also get to meet the Governor (David Morrisey) and long time fan favorite from the comics Michonne (Danal Gurira).END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray looks spectacular with a sharp, detailed and crisp transfer that stays true to the grainy look of the series. Audio continues to remain a strong suit as well with an active, strong 7.1 TrueHD presentation. There is also a French Dolby surround track. Subtitles are provided in English and Spanish but, curiously, there is no Spanish language track.The special features continue to remain top notch with eight featurettes. I haven't had the opportunity to view them all yet but they provide interesting observations and character background from cast and crew.Audio commentaries appear on the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth and 15th episodes. I haven't had the opportunity to work through them all yet but the two that I did listen to were informative providing interesting background on the respective episodes (four and five).Finally the special features are rounded out with six deleted scenes.As with previous seasons the show is housed in a Blu-ray plastic case. There isn't any insert with information about each episode and special features on each disc but they are mentioned in the onscreen menu.The third season of \"The Walking Dead\" continued to provide life threatening challenges for our heroes and introduced two major characters that are pivotal to this season and the changes that occur. The presentation for the show on Blu-ray is terrific.Highly recommended"
B009FZFONO Andrea and Michonne are not that interesting anyway ... and the governor and his group are unlikeable. If they have too many shows focused on this group, they're going to lose me ... and I was a serious fan!"
B009FZFONO I love it.The best thing is not the zombies, but the people interactions, especially the tensions between some of the characters. Well done by a group of very good actors."
B009FZFONO It is season 3 and time to move from the farm into a prison.  Once you have all the Zombies locked out, you've got nothing left to worry about, right? ... Right? ... Oh come on now.  People need to all be on the same team.  Can't we just get along?  Evidently not."
B009FZFONO After the first couple of shows I was hooked and have remained so. Every season more twists and turn's and characters are added.That keeps me always looking forward to the next show or season."
B009FZFONO This season has been heart breaking,mind blowing and Earth shattering all at once! twists at every turn and &#34;Biters&#34;around every corner! There has been some sad moments as we loose some characters that have been around from the beginning and at least one character that re-emerges from the past whom we assumed was dead and turned walker.this is a great show that explores what the limit of humans are capable of in extreme situations(both good and bad)&#34;.The hard part about about being in a zombie apocalypse will be pretending I'm not excited&#34;(from a bumper sticker)"
B009FZFONO this is one of the best episodes of the season. unfortanly you wait until the last 7 min for action"
B009FZFONO I love that I can get all of the episodes right away.  There's such a congestion of shows on Sunday nights, I don't have to get an expensive DVR and try and record them all...I just get them right away from Amazon.  Of course, I am totally involved in all the characters, and I can't wait until the show returns in the fall.  Do I need a life?  Well, this series is just great and totally unpredictable!"
B009FZFONO So much fun and suspense, always on the edge of our seats.  The only problem is the seasons are too short and the time between seasons is TOO long, almost to fault."
B009GEAWOU This is actually a pretty funny series. My wife turned me into it. Its about a group of close friends. Its funny and I would recommend it if you a fan of comedy TV shows. You should give it a try you want be disappointed"
B009GEAWOU Without a doubt, one of the best parts of How I Met Your Mother is Neil Patrick Harris's very randy Barney. It's amazing how he gets involved in Lily and Marshall's nanny search. But it's just one example of how the show successfully ties the problems of one couple or character into those of the others."
B009GEAWOU Well, firstly I like a lot of the actors and actresses in this show.  Ted grates on my nerves at times, but that's the fault of the whiney part they have him playing, not the actor himself.And Barney.... I liked the actor in Dougie Howser, and the White Castle movie.. .and, well, his character started out as reprehensible and went down hill from there.I think that's a common thread with all these characters, over the years they have gone from pretty funny, to some sort of twisted characterization (sp?) of what they were initially.Couple that with the whole premise, which to me implied &#34;Just wait til you meet his wife, she will be (wait for it)  AWESOME&#34;.The actress that they got to portray Ted's wife did an excellent job in my opinion, BUT (Stop here if you haven't seen the series finale).Spoilers....It's like they decided &#34;yup, time to end the series, let's throw the audience a bone, give them the mother, then kill her off post haste so Ted can possibly get back together with Robin....&#34;, Who, has been with the majority of New York by the end of the series.  Sort of like going out and intentionally buying used tires that you know are retreaded for your car.I thought the end cheapened Barney, Robin and what I had hoped for as a redemption in his character at least.  And the whole &#34;Yeah, slept with 31 women in one month, oopsie, got the last one preggers....&#34;  (what did he do wear a hole through his condom?And TED, after all the crap he went through, they couldn't bear to give him a happily ever after &#34;Well, he met the love of his life, that last for a couple of years, back out there now...&#34;Yeah, that sort of thing happens in real life (lost my wife a few years ago), but this was pegged as a romantic comedy.3 Stars just because previous years have been entertaining.I actually stopped watching this around season 6 - 7 when it looked like Robin was starting to bounce through the second round of the same guys and none of the other plot points interested me.Went back for Season 8, fast tracked through most of it, just to get a consistent feel for the finale.Never will get that time back.First few seasons, I thought entertaining, downhill slide from there, still one of the better things that was on TV at the time."
B009GEAWOU The characters are rich and the writing is excellent.  The episodes are 22 minutes and it's great for a quick laugh without requiring too much of a time commitment."
B009GEAWOU I was very hesitant to watch this show while it was airing or on netflix for years. Not because I heard anything bad about it, i just wasn't into it. I finally started watching it about a month ago and was I surprised! It is hilarious! Probably one of my favorite sitcoms ever. I am also a fan of Seinfeld and Scrubs, my kind of humor. I would definitely recommend this show, really to anyone,"
B009GEAWOU How they keep coming up with the shenanigans they get into baffles me. Love the unity of the crew no matter what new things happen. Can't wait to see Ted meet his wife :)"
B009GEAWOU The show is great. The cast and writing are both excellent. I highly recommed all the seasons. We are getting closer to finding out who the mother is."
B009GEAWOU all of their eight seasons have been consistently great, nothing too outlandish!!  cant wait for season 9 to start next year!!!!!!"
B009GEAWOU thought this was going to be the last season. you could feel that they are about to lose the charm of the show but it holds true in most of the episodes. still definitely a funny show.NPH is the man"
B009GEAWOU Even though there is repetitive elements to the show, the comedy has stood up well after eight seasons. I would not say it is like the first few but on average is better that most shows after this long. I will be staying with it until it is canceled."
B009GEAWOU Himym is probably one of the best comedies written in our time! I will be very sad when it ends."
B009GEAWOU Without spoiler's, which I know a lot of people hate in these reviews, and I am one of them as well.  This season is funny, but I think season's 1-6 are much better.....just seems like the running joke of &#34;who is Ted's wife&#34; has gone on enough. But Neil Patrick Harris still in my opinion, saves this show and makes it entertaining and worth watching."
B009GEAWOU This was a great season and one that I will not forget. I loved the build up in Season 8 to the final season. The DVD was well put together and had some great special features. In particular, I loved watching both the The Making of \"P.S. I Love You\" video and the video itself as this was a great addition (IMHO) to the season, among many others. As you can see I am a big fan and I am going to be sad to see the last season end! If you missed any of Season eight or if you are just a huge fan of the series, this is a great addition to any DVD collection!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*"
B009GEAWOU This has gone on too long.  Who cares anymore.  I wish the kids had never been born.  Please end this."
B009GEAWOU If you do not have ovaries, you will completely miss any appeal this show has, and I hope you are only watching it to get into the pants of someone with ovaries who happens to be a fan. Completely from the female point of view, this show does nothing more than highlight to the rest of the world that \"men\" in America are nothing more than feminized ideals brought about by our guilt that we are somehow responsible for women not having penises. It is a complete failure even in its attempts mock itself. The actors are all on their way out of the Hollywood meat-grinder and they know it and are not afraid to let the desperation seep into their performances. You'd just as well watch several Old Navy commercials back to back, at least then you might see some celebs of note."
B009GEAWOU This is such a great show. I know two types of people, those who hate it and those who love it. Since my husband and I lived in New York it is very easy to identify yourself with the characters. We have watched and re watched the seasons because they never get old."
B009GEAWOU The show should have only ran 6 seasons. After the sixth season the shows writing and acting seemed forced. The jokes were old, and the show is just terrible. The seventh season was slow, but season 8 was terrible. I am going to stop watching after this season."
B009GEAWOU This show seems to be puttering out. Performance are getting stale and so are the characters.Barney was one of my favorites, now I feel like I can quote his lines before he says them.And Ted. Oh man, please, somebody shoot that character. So annoying. The worst kind of character. One that Says NO to everything and is a roadblock in moving the story forward.But, I still watch the damn thing. Cause they got me hooked.So, it's okay."
B009GEAWOU ...unless you don't watch from season 1 episode 1.  By far the best series on TV and will continue to be the best!"
B009GEAWOU Really enjoyed being able to watch the entire series at my own pace. Hope u continue to offer these awesome series programs for your customers."
B009GEAWOU This season was OK, but I mean, come on. It needs to end. It's time has come. Thankfully we finally saw Ted's soon to be wife, but hopefully this next season they'll get marred, have kids & live happily ever after."
B009GEAWOU Our family loves how I met your mother.  We watch it as often as we can.  Barney is such a funny character."
B009GEAWOU I love &#34;how i met your mother.&#34; I am sad to see it go but glad its on Amazon! Awesome!"
B009GEAWOU This has more than a plot about Barney not wanting to give up his apartment \"fortress.\"  I was not expecting these various funny satires.  They make fun of art society and the things rich people would buy.  A small comedy of the wife/ mother spending more time on her career, leaving the husband (Marshal) feeling rejected.  And then there's Woodworthy Manor.  I'd just watch this show just for that plot.I am the artistic one in the family.  I still find humor in the show's satire towards art and the stereotype of art society.  Kyle Maclachlan as \"The Captain\" is the rich guy who has hired Lily as his Art Consultant.  I think The Captain is hilarious.  His attitude is both snobby and ignorant.  Lily changing her look from typical Lily to a contemporary art fan.Woodworthy Manor is a comedy of Downton Abbey.  We never see the show itself, but I liked the way Ted, Marshal and Lily were obsessed over the show.  They even had tea, crumpets and other English dishes - dishware included.  Ted would even pretend to have an English accent during Barney's open house.  I watched one episode of Downton Abbey and might see more.  But like Barney and Robin, I would have used the escape chute to leave quickly from being pressured to watching the show.  I would like to see more of this satire of Woodworthy Manor.I loved this show the most out of all the 100+ shows."
B009GEAWOU I really like this tv series. I just keep hoping Ted will find who he is going to marry.  Mean while everyone can remember what its like to be young and single."
B009GEAWOU Another great season of howI met your mother I can't wait to see the rest of the season! Love this show!!"
B009GEAWOU This is a great series I have watched over and over. Great story line and plenty of laughs Sorry to see it go"
B009GEAWOU The show still funny most of the time and the actors are still fantastic but it does have the feeling of being stretched out. I think it's time we finally meet the mother!"
B009GEAWOU I enjoyed the show for a long time, but the last two seasons have been reaaaally phoned in.  Its probably good that it will be ending soon, or so they say."
B009GEAWOU Even though I loved the show, there were great seasons and bad seasons. In ranking the seasons, there are several contenders for worst including season 4 when the show had gotten through its initial 3 season arc and was flailing around for stories when it seemed like it was on the verge of becoming stuck in &#34;whacky characters doing stuff&#34; tedium (with Sarah Chalke hanging out to remind us of Scrubs and what happens when that's the show) and barely moved to growth and development. There was season 6 with Zoey sucking the life out of everything.Still, this one is the worst for several reasons. The growth that the characters have gone through seem to be temporary at best. Even after Barney and Robin get engaged, there are episodes with Barney going back to the Playbook which had stopped being funny years ago. Abby Eliot plays a cartoonish shrew as Ted's last crazy girlfriend. This season also has the groan-inducing episode where Marshall is arguing a case in a courtroom and everyone pretends to be tough in high school. The new joke about Robin always yelling at Patrice is only serving to make Robin unlikeable.There are some ok episodes, mostly when the show is pushing forth the Robin/Barney coupling and when the show mentions t
B009GEDP26 This show is definitely my favorite on television right now.  The murder mysteries themselves aren't top-of-the-line, but the humor and chemistry between the characters is what makes Castle great.  If you haven't seen the series, check out the first few episodes.  If you're a series fan, season 5 is another great installment, worth picking up."
B009GEDP26 Great Series, wondered why it was on for 10 years, after watching it, I now know. Very funny. Nathan is a hoot."
B009GEDP26 TV series are generally based on a premise, gets completely tied to that premise and if they try and evolve it to the next step they wind up running right over a cliff or jumping the nearest shark.Castle, I've bought the entire series, done a mass marathon (luckily this was before twinkies ceased to exist;  Now with that lack, don't know if I'd have the stamina to pull it off).Concept - Castle is an amazing mystery writer, 26 or more best sellers (even though he claims to only do 1 book a year), gets pulled in in episode 1, season 1 to help Beckett (Gorgeous Homicide detective, female), solve a mystery that is using murders out of his books.  He gets hooked on her and off we go.The series is formulaic, there's an &#34;A&#34; story line (Generally the murder), and at least one &#34;B&#34; story line (some progression of the character's relationships).&#34;A&#34; story lines, generally take the form of some tribute to a genre (real wives of name your place, star trek type conventions, thematic episodes I assume played around specific holidays (Halloween in particular &#34;Undead again&#34; being a particular favorite &#34;Our killer's a zombie!&#34;), there are of course more &#34;natural&#34; killings as well, so don't think they're all some sort of trumped up bizarre thing.  In most cases these lines are decently thought out, my only fault with them is the sheer number of false leads they give you through the course of the episode.  Watching sometimes, I'd think my head would explode if they threw another twist to the murder at me.&#34;B&#34; storylines, tend to lighten the mood, provide a distraction from all the murdering going on.  (Wish they had a compressed stream of just the &#34;B&#34; lines sometimes.)  They do use the same sorts of mechanisms a lot to bring home their points, and as I say if not for the generally excellent performance of the actors it could get annoying, very predictable.  But in this case, I forgive them that as Most episodes are full of solid entertainment.Plot progression - I could name off several series where the big hook to keep the audience coming back was the old &#34;will they or won't they&#34; thing and the audience is left hanging until the last moment of the last episode to find out &#34;will they?&#34;Castle has taken the approach over the 5 seasons so far of maturing the relationship between Castle and BeckettI have to say I admire the story writers progressing the story line and managing to find things to do after the characters get together.Best of the series - the characters, the humorWorst of the series - Sometimes it could jump the orca (much larger than a shark) around motivation on plotting and agreements that the characters get into (the entire Beckett Mother getting killed storyline, several times I was what the?)Still at this point likely the most enjoyable show I am watching"
B009GEDP26 they have alot of history each other and they are perfect for each other. it a very awesome show and i never get bored every show!"
B009GEDP26 This is a fabulous show however two of the episodes this season were just a bit too far fetched.  Still love it however and every single episode cannot appear the every viewer."
B009GEDP26 The amateur sleuth who gets first hand knowledge of the crimes he only knows on paper has a special interest to me as I dabble in crime fiction, Gumshoe style.  The investigative part of the show is detailed and entertaining."
B009GEDP26 This is a great crime dramedy featuring Nathan Fillion who we all know from Firefly! If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of &#34;Moon Lighting&#34;, &#34;Columbo&#34;, and &#34;Murder She Wrote&#34;. I am now officially in mourning however as we're flying through the seasons. My wife and I tend to watch a few episodes a day and before we know it, we'll be caught up and stuck waiting a week for each new episode! ACK!!!!  This is definitely the worst issue when it comes to finding shows that have been on for a few seasons when you discover them.  You become spoiled watching several episodes in a sitting and when you catch up and are forced to wait a whole week (or more) for a new episode... ugg!The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration. He's also a huge asset to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc. Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch. Season five continues to refine the chemistry between Beckett and Castle and their relationship is always in flux with lots of tension and humor. For the most part, you can jump around between episodes and not watch them in order. It seems that there are usually 4 or 5 episodes in each season that move the greater story arc plot along. The other shows, while equally fantastic, focus elusively on the murder of the day and not Becket or Castle's past.  This season is no exception to the rule and there are some major developments in the primary story arc.As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6. We just started watching about two months ago, ripped through season 1 - 4 and just wrapped up 5. Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back makes for nice unwind time after the kids are fast asleep! Long live Castle! :)"
B009GEDP26 Castle is one of those shows to which I always look forward.  It is a rare combination of mystery, action, humor, and romance.  This show has it all, and Rick Castle does steal the show, without fail.  I am always laughing and absolutely glued to this one.  I hope it runs for many seasons."
B009GEDP26 The writers of Castle really deserve a pat on their collective backs. Season five has focused on different characters in separate episodes letting the relationship between Becket and Castle simmer quietly in the background. As a result, the viewer has learned more about the supporting characters giving the plot more depth and enhancing the characters themselves. Then an episode will air that focuses once again on Becket and Castle's relationship. The entire season built nicely to the last episode. The viewer is left wondering not only about Becket's choice but also the affect her choice will have on the other characters. Basically, where will the show go from here? Nice cliffhanger...My only quibble is Castle himself. Becket's character has grown in complexity, and the writers, costume and make-up folks have consistently raised the level of her allure intellectually as well as physically. In fact, Castle keeps getting reminded by characters passing through the episodes that he doesn't know what he has in Becket. Castle's character is mellowing, which is fine, but his physically appearance is getting sloppy. He needs to hit the gym before Becket finds some of those one episode only characters more attractive than Castle with the viewers applauding her defection."
B009GEDP26 I love this season.  I like that the relationship between Castle and Beckett finally happened.  The magnetism between the two is so good I keep looking to see if they are a real couple.  This is the way a show should be.  A good human story and a good mystery with a minimum of violence and gore.  True story telling.  This show is one of the few shows now on TV that I really like to watch.  It is good.  I hope it is around a few more years."
B009GEDP26 The same old same old, another cop show with a so-called best selling author sidekick. This kind of show has been done to death. ANOTHER cop show? Adding a writer of fiction cop books to the same old same old mix is something new?It was cute for the first season, all that sexual tension between them, but now that's over and now the show is slowly dying. It won't see another season."
B009GEDP26 This is such a great series, I just love it. It is everything I love about a great series...I especially love the fact it's about another writer...that rocks!"
B009GEDP26 Best show is when Castle's Daughter is kidnapped and castle goes to find her. The writers show Castle in such a different light, that it is almost scary how dark he can get in &#34;real-life&#34; instead of just in his novels. I don't like &#34;Iron Gates&#34; I believe that should be a male character and can't wait to see her either leave or get on board with the team.One thing I don't understand, why can Javi and Leighy have a relationship out in the open? Yet not Castle and Beckett... Is it because they are working directly with each other...Or is it because there needs to a rule that they are breaking to keep it dramatic...or is there really no way to portrate love over a murder case...."
B009GEDP26 VERY GOOD PLOT LINES.  THE WRITERS ARE GREAT AND KEEP ME COMING BACK FOR MORE.  THE REGULAR CHARACTERS ARE LIKEABLE."
B009GEDP26 Even though, or probably because of, this season just was not as good as earlier season. Still like the show and will continue watching"
B009GEDP26 Brilliantly written, masterfully performed and profoundly developed as a whole. Every aspect of this show produces a fun break from the day to day. I look forward to watching these shows each week and am delighted to be able to obtain them on my kindle fire so I can rewatch them, as time permits, throughout the summer break."
B009GEDP26 Castle is well-cast, with lots of witty banter between cast members and sharp, well-written scripts.  It's good to see Castle and Beckett finally together, although it remains a minor plot line."
B009GEDP26 I like the solving the crime shows.  I just wish Castle and Beckett would finally get married.  You can tell they want to, but the writers keep dragging it out."
B009GEDP26 The comedy/drama stories are unfailingly good and engaging without being either as horrifying or unnecessarily, nauseatingly gory as some are (Bones, for example) and the love chemistry between Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) and Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) - a tantalizingly long time emerging - is spellbinding. They are both wonderful performers and Stana Katic, in addition to being an excellent actor, is easily one of the most stunningly beautiful women alive - no minor compliment in what is in fact a universe of beautiful Hollywood glamor \"babes\". She is so far beyond \"eye candy\" as to make that descriptive term meaningless. Fillion - as he proved in the all-too short-lived \"Firefly\" series - is extraordinary and unique as a comic/action/love interest player. Together, they draw you inexorably, almost nail-bitingly into their developing personal drama. All the supporting players, from Lanie the ME to Rick's daughter and mother, and the two other team detectives, Esposito and Ryan, are likewise wonderful and add the perfect extra dimension to this five-star show.DRBridge"
B009GEDP26 Another great season with a fun show that I look forward to getting each year since I don't watch on commercial tv during the year. Things have matured in several ways was this year. The daughter is off in college. There is romance finally thrown into the mix. I really enjoyed this."
B009GEDP26 Odds were pretty much against the show when the principles gave in to their romantic attraction for each other as it's been the death of more than one popular show in the past. However, exceptional scripts by writers who not only know their craft, they love their characters--and actors who return the love with quality performances every episode--have added dimension and depth, enhancing a great show and exceeding the hopeful expectations of its fan base."
B009GEDP26 The stories are the perfect mix of humor and action, drama and unfulfilled romance (maybe this season not so unfulfilled).  Everyone can enjoy this series and the writers are amazing."
B009GEDP26 I don't have cable or satellite & only watch DVD's. I initially came across Castle by accident & was hooked. I have all 5 seasons now & season 5, in my opinion, was the BEST yet!  This season finally ties up some loose ends we've been waiting for  the last 4 seasons - like who killed Kate's mother and who is Castle's father.  There were some good laughs and good suspense. The show is very well written & a real joy to watch. Very entertaining. I'm only sorry I have to wait another year for season 6 to come out on DVD."
B009GEDP26 I love everything about this show. Writing, chemistry, stories. I think Stana Katic is beautiful and her portrayal of Detective Beckett is magic."
B009GEDP26 The 2XK serial killer is the only villain in the \"Castle\" mythology whose seemingly limitless evil frightens even Richard Castle.  This episode resurrects - and then kills - that character again but what it really does is show just how deep the trust between Beckett and Castle has actually become.  Plus it is an obvious precursor for another episode that will surely follow where we'll meet 2XK again and hopefully, finish him.  One of the darkest \"Castles\" ever but also one of the most moving.Don't listen to the naysayers on this episode - they just didn't get the ending!"
B009GEDP26 there is a 2-part episode, that is very similar to the movie &#34;Taken&#34; with Liam Neeson...the cast in the show even make reference to it when they talk about Castle. Great show, great season, worth watching."
B009GEDP26 Since I moved I can't get TV where I live so Tuesday morning I watch Castle on my laptop.  It's a ritual and all know don't disturb me Tuesday morning.  It use to be don't call from 9-10 on Monday night.  It has been a long time since there has been as rewarding a show as Castle.  Everyone connected with it is to be applauded from the script girl and drivers to the writers, directors, and leads.. Truly well done.  I own all the seasons and often run my own marathon.  Can't wait for 5 to come out,  already have it ordered.  I might add, being a great grand mother, this show appeals to all age groups.  There is something there for everyone.  Thanks again for giving us something to look at that is worth our time.."
B009GEDP26 I thoroughly enjoy watching Castle, and I was pleased to see that the 2 of them finally got together"
B009GEDP26 I have always enjoyed this show and Season 5 has continued to exceed my expectations. Excellent storyline and great dialog. In real life there isn't always a happy ending. The writers of this show showed how when there isn't a happy ending, there is &#34;I'll take what I can get&#34; endings. I look forward to the rest of the season."
B009GEDP26 Big question at the end.  Not the best or extravagant as I imagined, but something definitely worth to watch.  Castle's birthday present was awesome.  I didn't see that one coming."
B009GEDP26 When a show hinges on the feelings of the two leads for each other, and after two, three, or four seasons they fall into each other's arms declaring their love it means the end is near. Fortunately Castle has more going for it. The writing is very decent and the cast is excellent. This season the shows have been a bit up and down, all very watchable, but some better than others. Then suddenly three terrific episodes in a row: the two-part kidnapping episode followed by an episode with Ryan getting a chance to shine by going undercover as an Irish hoodlam followed by the fun take on Hitchcock's film Rear Window. The show continues to maintain the fun and quality that began in the first season. I find that most television shows have a life of three to five years before burn-out, this show has the potential to keep going. Makes me happy!"
B009GEDP26 Nathan is still the sexiest man on tv - perhaps the sexiest man anywhere! But kudos to Stana for serving as his near-perfect foil."
B009GEDP26 This is one of my must watch shows.  He's so cheeky and she's all business, they make a good combination.  Have a collection going on with this one and manage to watch the reruns too."
B009GEDP26 I title this season (5) CASTLES AND QUEENS because I think the primary actor (Nathan Fillion) and actress (Stana Katic) are virtually king and queen of the murder, comedy, and melodrama serieson TV and I include BONES, THE MENTALIST along with CASTLE.  All 3 shows are excellent but seem to follow similar story lines.  I have all the episodes of the three shows on DVD or video libraries (from AMAZON of course!) and they all have their virtues and vices.  But Beckett is so charming and hot, one wonders why Castle took so long to get together with her.  It does seem  that all the women (Bones, Beckett and Lizbon) have walls built around them fearing to get to close to anyone.  They all have problems in their childhood perhaps that caused these walls to be built.In this season we have quite a variety of story lines, from Alexi being kidnapped (two part episode) to mocking STAR TREK, to romantic interludes, Castle being framed, and poking fun and horrorstories.  Like the other shows these five seasons has a great supporting cast (Ryan and Esposito) and a nasty female boss who for some odd reason wants to be addressed as \"sir\".  And like other showsthere are very obnoxious people, specifically Castles mother: arrogant, a moocher and a big spender (of Castles money).  She reminds me of that old hag in \"SUNSET STRIP\" who dreamt of making a comeback in movies: \"I'm ready for my closeup, Mr DeMille!\"  She repels me like Dr Sweets in BONES, a lousy actor who doesn't know the first thing about psychology!B
B009GEDP26 This is a review of the 5th Season.So, Castle and Beckett are now a couple.  Cue the doom.Well, it didn't happen.  Beckett, who has not been my favorite, has really grown on me this season.  The pairing has really worked.Strangely, it's Castle who seems a bit off to me at times.  Does he really believe in everything crackpot idea?  And would he really be saying \"Shoot Bigfoot?\"The final episode gets us to two big events which could lead to huge cast changes.  Very curious how this will work out."
B009GEDP26 Excellent quality in audio and video. Love the Castle episodes. Have all episodes in the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO on my ROKU."
B009GEDP26 enjoyable watch good characters and watchable episodes. The dynamic between shows a symbiotic relationship that is interesting to watch and see grow"
B009GEDP26 this series is good but I am seeing some pretty bad writing towards the end of this season. I fear they may be wrapping things up. Actors are good actors though."
B009GEDP26 Great season after watching it I went back and rewatched the whole series, I'm currently watching season 6 on TV and love it."
B009GEDP26 This is a thirties style show taking place now inNYC. Think Hepburn and Tracy in a contemporary scene. The novels are good, too."
B009GEDP26 This episode could stand on its own.  I've watched it several times as it is more than a show but a bone tickler and the setting and props are very well done.  I think it is movie quality.  I love Castle and the bantering between Richard Castle, writer, and Beckett, detective. I originally started watch this program because I loved Nathan Fillion in the shows Serenity and Firefly.  This particular episode is about a science fiction convention and how it is discovered that Beckett while in college was heavy into Sci-Fi a particular show, similar to Star Trek.  This episode spoofs Firefly.  I can't tell you the end as it would spoil the hilarity you will enjoy.  So...funny...  I know I will watch it many more times as there is so much to enjoy."
B009GEDP26 As a longtime Castle fan I like this season's writing and acting a lot; the cleverness and nuances of plotlines and chemistry among the actors is at an all time high.  In Season 5 the relationship between Castle and Beckett develops further as they initially try to keep their romance private from co-workers.  Storylines are very well-told and well-thought out.Castle's intelligent screenplays and wonderful ensemble cast continues to shine.  Castle's my favorite show and has been for the last couple years.  Why?  Because the writing and characters are believable, engaging, fun to watch and captivating.  I initially started watching this because Nathan Fillion was so outstanding in Joss Whedon's legendary \"Firefly\" series (which I still re-watch often) and I wanted to see him in other roles.  Speaking of which it's great to see guest stars and rare Firefly homages in Castle (eg Final Frontier ep, thanks; it's appreciated :).  Nice saucer easter egg in the menu in one in the Castle season 5 dvds.Castle is easily one of the top shows to be produced in recent years, well worth watching, and it's great to see that the evolving relationship of Castle and Beckett is still edgy and fun, not having lost anything 'the morning after' -- masterfully written scripts and brilliant acting helps Castle continue to shine. Thanks everyone for doing it right.-Ken"
B009GEDP26 Since season 4 ended I have been wondering how the writers would bring all the players back into the fold.  They have done so in a most rewarding way.  As for the three eposides that have aired, I am in doubt the Captain knows of the new feelings between C & B but from previous episodes I get the notion that R & E have figured it out.  I am looking forward to see how the writers work in the Captain learning the secret - which is no longer a true secret - and how the 'twist' will unfold.  Monday is a great night."
B009GEDP26 Five years in but the characters keep getting more interesting.  I am pleased the relationship between the two has not derailed the storyline."
B009GEDP26 Castle and Beckett believe a murder case is linked to a storage locker. Castle bids and wins the storage locker and its contents, but only finds cheap trashy treasures. When Captain Victoria Gates sees Castle holding a rare porcelain doll that would complete her collection, he happily hands it over. Suddenly, the captain loves Rick and even buys a complete set of his books for him to autograph. Working through a list of suspects, the murder victim's employer's household and seemingly unrelated low lifes, the reason for murder and perpetrator is found. Unfortunately, resolving the murder costs Castle his new found friendship with the captain and she is back to hating him by the end of the episode. Very funny entry in the Castle cannon."
B009GEDP26 Love this show.  It is one I can watch over and over again.  I have watched castle from the beginning also."
B009GEDP26 When Castle first aired, it was fresh, funny, and fanciful (a novelist who brought his writer's imagination to the case). I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars then. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining show, but there is less emphasis on the writer's skills, less interaction with his daughter and mother (which was truly fun to watch), the writing is not always fresh at this point--something any television show has to struggle with after several seasons. The way the murders are solved is a bit predictable--the first suspects are never the killer. However, we keep watching because there is still a good deal of character development for the ensemble cast; there are still surprising plot twists and continuing story lines, and in the end we really like the actors and the characters they play."
B009GEDP26 Like usually this is great Castle. It's hard to stop watching but you have to do other things too. I would recommend to anybody"
B009GEDP26 I love the entire series of Castle.....and have them all. There are only a few of the American programs that I love and Castle is one of them."
B009GEDP26 A fantastic ensemble of actors with great writing, and a very winning story. I love this show and these characters!"
B009GEDP26 The season 1 through 5 are wonderful.  I hope they will be able to keep the show going as NCIS has with twists and turns."
B009GEDP26 Castle is really just a lot of fun.  I can't stand most shows like this, just too repetitive, and every single one of them (ncis - law and order) is so close in both form and content if you've seen one then you've seen em all.  Castle manages to break out of that mold with a VERY strong cast - i can't stress how strong - and great writing.Give it a shot. If you don't fall in love with Beckett and Castle with the first few episodes you aren't human."
B009GEDP26 Love all the characters... So glad that Castle & Kate are together now... Love watching it every time... Can't wait for the next episode..."
B009GEDP26 Fox adds commercials when you buy Bones episodes, so I've come to appreciate Castle's episode-only instant video.  A lot of people thought the show would falter now that Kate and Castle are together, but the writers are doing a good job.  Just wish there were more poker parties with Connelly and Patterson..."
B009GEDP26 It is great to be able to stream on amazon prime. The show is so cute and sometimes it makes you think real hard"
B009GEDP26 Every sane man wants to be in Castle's shoes. Niki heats is hotter than hot, oooooooooooooweeeeeeeeeee! The story lines are fantastic and the whole crew has chemistry."
B009GEDP26 I work with cops. Because of where I work, I look for more 'lighter' or comical shows to escape to because I watch enough of real life on 12+hour shifts. I'm also somewhat of a geek/nerd and absolutely LOVED Firefly!! So, as a Nathan Fillion fan, I watched a couple of episodes and I got hooked into the relationship development between Castle and Det. Beckett. And for me, this show hits every like button - Nathan Fillion, cop show, books (Fillion is a book writer in this show)."
B009GEDP26 Every year Beckett and Castle get close, then fall apart.  This year they are closer than ever, finally taking the plunge and becoming a couple, but this takes the tension that has been a part of the show for several years now.  This will have to be resolved some how, so be prepared for something unpopular by the end of the season."
B009GEDP26 The 5th season of Castle did a couple things very well.  First, it brought closure to, but did not totally conclude the who killed Beckett's mother storyline.  We finally find out who was behind it all, but the door is left open for more story lines involving that person.  Secondly it finally brought Castle and Beckett together as a couple.Obviously in this kind of show there is always a danger in the series running out of steam when the couple is finally brought together.  That really did not happen this season.  Stana Kanic and Nathan Fillion have very good chemistry, and the writing around the characters did not get stale.  I also liked the fact that they did not go the predictable route and split them up shortly after getting them together.  The writers let the relationship play out over the course of the season.  There was tension in the relationship in the final few episodes, which provided a nice lead up to the cliffhanger ending.The standout episodes of the season to me were the Rear Window spoof, the two-part episode where Alexis is kidnapped, the one where Castle is framed for murder, and the episode where Beckett is caught on a bomb.  That last one shows many of the great moments from the prior seasons through flashbacks.  The show also keeps up the tradition of throwing in references to Firefly, having awesome guest cameos, a
B009GEDP26 Let's see, a crime show involving a murder mystery writer and a detective who looks like she just stepped off the fashion runway...must be silly trash. Not! The show continues to entertain. Nathan Fillion is still trying to inherit the mantle of quirkiest actor from William Shatner. That said, his performance continues to hold up and is very entertaining. What can I say about Stana Katic? She is drop dead gorgeous...and she can actually act. Molly C. Quinn is good as the daughter, Susan Sullivan chews the scenery as the mother, both Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever are excellent as detectives. Great show!"
B009GEDP26 I love the way the writers combine romance, humor, and a strong family unit with a basic police procedural.  The crimes are not gross or overtly violent but always complicated and it takes Castle to create/make up/discover the stories that fit the facts to solve the crime.  I love a show that makes me smile from beginning to end AND is family friendly."
B009GEDP26 This series is often a little humorous and the characters seem to be having fun in spite of dealing with some really mean folks. Maybe I'll have to read at least one of &#34;Richard Castle's&#34; books one of these days. I would be interested in knowing who actually writes them."
B009GEDP26 Love this show due to Castle and Beckett love affair, also love how Castle has a connection with his daughter.  Great that Ryan and Jennie are going to have a baby, wonder how that going to play out."
B009GEDP26 I chose this season because I have the other four seasons and I love the show....not too fond of Iron Gates but she had some pretty big shoes to fill after Montegomery. It's fun and witty and the banter between all the characters is wonderful."
B009GEDP26 I never cease to laugh aloud when watching this series.  The cast is wonderful as is the writing.  It is great Sat. night TV; more often than night beating a datenight movie."
B009GEDP26 Really loved Castle when it had a layered storyline (Beckett's mother, the serial killer, etc) and when it had connectedness with characters.  This season has lost the magic.  It's episodic, contrived and tired.  The character chemistry is gone as we see little of Alexis and Castle's mother and the relationship with Beckett and Castle lacks substance.  The one-liners and stories are mostly predictable and the season finale was anti-climatic.  And what's with the cameo appearance of Beckett's Dad?  We never see the guy and suddenly we are supposed to connect with a moment when she is at a crossroads and meets him for coffee for advice? Blah. Wishing they would have tied it up neatly a season ago as I'm finding that I don't really care what happens now."
B009GEDP26 I really like this episode because we get to see Becket and Castle in a romantic setting. The murder puts a damper on their weekend but there are a couple of really steamy scenes in this one. We need more episodes with romance."
B009GEDP26 Just purchased Season 5....can't wait to watch and get caught up before the new Season 6 starts in the fall!!"
B009GEDP26 My wife and I love to watch Castle! It's a great show with both enough comedy and drama to keep you coming back for more."
B009GEDP26 This show is one of the most entertaining New York detective shows anybody has ever made. It's brilliantly cast and the actors are totally engaging.  Love it!!!"
B009GEDP26 I chose the rating because this is one of my favorite shows. Every episode makes me laugh and keeps me interested. I like the writing and cast for the series. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different to watch."
B009GEDP26 Great crime drama series!! All 5 seasons are fun, interesting and full of surprises!"
B009GEDP26 They just keep getting better.  I usually get tired of a series by this time and of course not all of the episodes are jewels, but the bulk still holds up and they throw in a surprise that will make you say &#34;Didn't see that coming&#34;.  Truly this show is just fun to watch."
B009GEDP26 If like me, you watch the season all at once, be aware of the season ending cliff hanger - you won't want to wait to fnd out what's going to happen next.  I am still trying to decide if I like Castle and Beckett dating - it generally works (but not always)."
B009GEDP26 I thought once Beckett and Castle were a couple, the series would just die, so many do; but instead it has breathed new life into the series.  One of the best seasons ever!"
B009GEDP26 Castle is one of the best shows out there.  It combines humor and mystery with just the right amount of drama to keep you coming back for more."
B009GEDP26 My wife and I really look forward to watching this show.  The plots and acting are always consistently good, and cast is strong from top to bottom.  This is one of our favorite shows-- maybe THE favorite."
B009GEDP26 The story between the two lead actors are amazing and I enjoy so much thank for keeping me interested in the show every week."
B009GEDP26 Casting, writing, excellent.  Worried the stories might not be as driven with the tensions between Beckett and Castle resolved, but still loving their love story."
B009GEDP26 The character development and interaction of this detective thriller series make it a delight to watch. My wife and I find it totally delightful."
B009GEDP26 This show has dipped in the ratings, but I enjoy the current shows as much as watching past shows of this series. I enjoy the witty and funny dialog that lightens up the heavy cop procedural drama moments."
B009GEDP26 The story still works after the sexual tension was released. What a relief! I hated the idea that we would be dished out another year of desperate misunderstanding and longing."
B009GX69RK I love this show - so quirky and funny. The whole cast does an amazing job, I can re watch this show over and over and still laugh every time!"
B009GX69RK New Girl's second season was just as strong as season one. Zooey Deschanel was born to play the quirky but loveable Jessica Day. In the start of season 2, Jess loses her job as a teacher and she also kind of loses who she is halfway through the season. She begins a sexual relationship with a guy who thinks she's someone else at first, then she starts to have real feelings for him in the Halloween episode. But that storyline arc isn't what makes season 2 so special. In episode 15, \"Cooler\" Nick (her insecure, unmotivated roommate) and Jess share a very passionate and intense kiss. I haven't seen chemistry this strong since Ross and Rachel on \"Friends\" in the mid-90s. After that episode, Nick and Jess dance around their feelings for each other. They are good friends, but Jess is afraid that Nick is not the right guy for her because he lacks direction and he's got commitment issues. Eventually by the time the episode, \"Virgins\" airs - Nick and Jess realize they can't deny their attraction anymore and take the plunge. What I like about this show is the Nick and Jess storyline could've been put on hold until later seasons, but the writers decided it would add more drama and authenticity to put them together as a potential couple instead of dragging it out. I really love this show. It's fresh, very funny, and full of surprising, heartfelt moments especially in the episode, \"Chicago,\" when the gang is there for Nick after his father dies. My favorite episodes include: \"Menzies\", \"Parents\", \"Pepperwood\", \"Quick Hardening Caulk\", and \"First Date\". I can't wait for season 3 and see how the whole Nick and Jess relationship plays out. Of course something tells me they won't be a couple for long, because Nick has a tendency to sabotage himself. Enjoy season 2 and I also recommend checking out season 1."
B009GX69RK This is the best show ever :) :)  The characters are so funny and refreshing as a cast.  So glad Fox wised up and did not cast a bunch of boring celebrities and instead chose fresh new faces to create this show.5 thumbs up!"
B009GX69RK pretty funny. not as much as the first season, but definitely has it's moments. zooey is, as always, hilarious. :)"
B009GX69RK I've been a fan of this sitcom and Zooey Deschanel since it began - she can do no wrong.  During its evolution, I found that every episode was headed in a good direction and kept me wanting to watch more. The chemistry between the characters Jess and Nick is unmistakable and encourages the audience to expect their relationship to grow.  I've seen really good sitcoms come and go and really bad ones run forever.  I truly hope this sitcom doesn't become a premature casualty.  The writers need to keep each episode fresh with something new and not head down a stagnant path.  For example, the latest episode, Neighbors, seemed pointless as the cheesy young neighbors came across as pretentious and immature while the main character's goal was to seek their approval for reasons unknown - why would mature professional adults seek the approval of younger wanna-bees? This just made no sense to me and became frustrating.  I just hope future episodes do not include the neighbors or it may lead to the demise of this sitcom."
B009GX69RK Best comedy since Friends. Good timing. Excellent outside characters. Love the bar setting. And the eventual hook ups bound to happen slowly but the chemistry was definitely was there.Box came a little bruised but whatever all the disc worked just fine so I'll be able to continually watch it so I don't care.Won't give away the coupling but since I haven't been able to handle any comedy since Friends lately this is the one to try out."
B009GX69RK While I really enjoy New Girl, it crosses the &#34;too sleazy&#34; line for me fairly often, which is why I stopped paying for the episodes. But if you like Zoey Deschanel and are looking for a raunchy comedy, this might just be for you."
B009GX69RK I started watching this series late last season, so I missed a lot, so it was nice to be able to watch all 25 of the episodes from season 2 and get caught up (I had already watched season one from the library). This is a well written, witty series and if you have not watched it, you should as it is one that will make you want to come back for more. Not only is the writing strong, but they did a great job at casting the series, and all do a tremendous job making their characters real. I felt that the series is not forced, and moves at a pace that you would expect, a
B009GX69RK I love this show.  Jess is charming and hilarious - a real goofy but comfortable in her goofiness.  Her roomies are the kind of guys you wish you could really meet at a bar although don't hold your breathe ladies.  This show is amazing.  I laugh out loud at every episode."
B009GX69RK This episode examines the huge differences between each of the characters and, particularly, the BFF's.  Linking them are some significant acts, both good and bad, that have occurred over years of friendship.  They haven't forgotten these things but, it is made clear, have chosen to continue in their relationships because they are kooky, original, compelling and, ultimately, kind.  Genuine and really funny.  Finally an episode I can wrap my head around.  Yay!"
B009GX69RK I freaking love this show. Such a cute and quirky comedy--it is one of the best of it's kind since Friends!"
B009GX69RK Can't wait for the new season to get started!! Love all the characters, especially Schmidt!!Wonder if CeCe's marriage will last!?!"
B009GX69RK Great show, lots of laughs. You really love the characters :)"
B009GX69RK If you're looking for deep thoughts look elsewhere but if you want a funny cast and lighthearted entertainment then u need to see this show. The cast knows why you're watching and never tries to make it anything its not. Absolutely worth a look!"
B009GX69RK Makes me laugh out loud every show ! in love with Nick! fancy man 1&2 are my favorites! Thank You!"
B009GX69RK Zooey Deschanel is my favorite. She's freaking hilarious and so is the guy that plays Nick Miller. This show makes me laugh so hard!!"
B009GX69RK Well-written and well acted. It's so much fun to watch the show! The actors, every single one of them, are amazing; it's easy to see the chemistry at work in this amazing ensemble cast. I look forward to each new episode!"
B009GX69RK Love the whole premise behind this adorable sitcom.  Great cast with great chemistry to make their crazy situations believable.  I love that the language and even sexual exploits are handled appropriately."
B009GX69RK This was one of my favorite episodes centering on the Nick/Jess will they/won't they. It really helped build some tension between the two, and it was nice to see them admitting their mutual attraction. I always love when Nick shows his soft side because of her."
B009GX6F10 i dont' hate it but it doesn't quite peak my intrest.  may end up watching it later if i am bored."
B009GX6F10 This is a great show, good plot lines, very authentic 60s. There is rumor that the show is going to be cancelled which is too bad, it's a great show.  It is unfortunate that networks no longer have the patience to let a show grow legs.  Hopefully, someone else will pick it."
B009GX6F10 I really like this show.  Dennis Quaid plays a sheriff who doesn't follow any of the rules.  He's the kind of sheriff that you wish we had today."
B009GX6F10 Maybe with time the actors will become comfortable with their characters and stop over-acting them.  Denis Quaid scowls and growls even when he smiles.  I get it, you are a miserable rancher forced into being a miserable sheriff.Chiklis isn't very imposing as a chicago goon in the desert.  Full face camera shots of his expressionless face don't frighten anyone.  OH....a miserable Havana casino manager now a miserable Vegas casino manager!The actor who plays Dix needs to decide what voice he is going to use all the time.....he sounds like Rich Little doing Denis Quaid....or a whining kid.  Pick one, please.The brother of the sheriff could disappear and noone would notice.  He and the casino chick will finally get it one when Frank and Dean come back."
B009GX6F10 Trult enjoying the show. Love Chikliss and all is badness. He pulls.it off well. Quaid is a good sheriff persona as well. Old cars, my parents' wardrobe, tantalizing story lines. I watch the series while working out. Energetic and immersing. Anticipating more good stuff."
B009GX6F10 I really enjoyed watching this series. They did a decent job of representing 60's Fremont Street area Las Vegas (except the California scenery in some parts is a more than a little too lush - too many trees and grass) compared to the part of Nevada where LV is located). But you can use your imagination and it is fine.I really enjoyed the soundtrack, but typical of made for TV series, it does not appear that you can buy it anywhere or even track down all the songs."
B009GX6F10 Just a fun look at Vegas in 1960.  Mob vs cowboys vs Mormons.  Interesting history in a fictional setting.  Sit back and relax."
B009GX6F10 Great attention to details with vintage cars, guns, clothes, and music.  A shame it hasn't a second season.  Beautiful woman and great action.."
B009GX6F10 I like the attention to detail (takes place in the early '60's) on the sets and props. The acting is excellent! My favorite show."
B009GX6F10 look who is in it!!! cant go wrong with that!!! and how in-depth the story gets to the time period they are portraying... I am a 60's child so it brings back memories to how it was back then in Vegas!!! action, suspense and all handsome men!!!!"
B009GX6F10 Very good, enjoy probably a little more action but the shows the 60s, the sheriff and gangster excellent, hope it continues another season"
B009GX6F10 I like MOB movies/shows. If this show didn't have that, I probably would only give this review 2 or maybe 1 star. There are too many flaws that make this show predictable.I.E. - Someone needs to get some info from an office so they place gum on the lock so the latch on the door won't catch. They then wait for the secretary to leave and close up the office. You can clearly see that the doors are glass and has a keyed lock. The doors cannot lock unless with a key. But when she leaves she just lets the doors close and doesn't lock them with a key.Every episode is about a murder that has been committed. In real life we know that suspects will lie forever and rarely admit that they did the crime . But when Dennis Quaid gets a suspect, after talking with them for only a minute they openly admit they committed the crime. He actually asks them, &#34;You did it, didn't you&#34;? And they immediately say  &#34;Yes&#34;. WOW!! I guess he solved that one.Plus, this takes place in the 1960's. And like every other show on TV today, God forbid if we blame a minority for anything. Same with this show. The minority's are always misunderstood and never do anything wrong and the whites are at fault for everything.Don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying that white's don't do anything bad; it's just that TV shows are so afraid to blame anyone else BUT white's because certain minority's will get offended.Get real."
B009GX6F10 This series has a very exciting concept, but lacks the acting skill to pull it off. Dennis Quaid hasn't got the personality to project a simple man of integrity, the land, traditions, etc. His whole demeanor, and his acting forte, just breathes &#34;complicated&#34;, hinting at mysterious depths and quirks. He should stick to roles that play on his strengths. Not to paint him into a stereotype, but he makes a great trickster, hood, playboy, bad boy. Clint Eastwood he is not. John Wayne he is not. Tom Selleck he is not. Serious miscasting here. Too bad."
B009GX6F10 Why rate it?  The idiots who produced this show cancelled it after one season.  I have to wonder what's running in its place, but I'm betting it's something as inane, vapid, and insulting as another kardashian &#34;reality&#34; show.What a shame, to take an outstanding piece of entertainment based on the story of a real man in our own country's history and trash it.Whatever you do, big brains out there in TV land, never produce anything of quality. It's too far above the heads of your empty- brained audience."
B009GX6F10 This brings back memories of the old Vegas. Lots of action and drama. Love the actors. Wish they would not have canceled the show."
B009GX6F10 My husband & I really enjoyed watching this program.  Great acting, not much language and how fun to see the 1960's again.  This was a great mix of western sherriff vs mob of vegas.  Wish there were more seasons."
B009GX6F10 Like the actors and the storylines are good. I like the early 60's setting along with the styles.. The shows tempo is good."
B009GX6F10 Liked this when it was on TV but missed some episodes. Love Chiclis and Quaid, although Quaid looks a little &#34;worn out&#34;. If you like period pieces with mobsters from the late 50's and 60's you'll enjoy this, I did."
B009GX6F10 For the most part I enjoy the show.  Just a little like other &#34;mob&#34; related programs for me to award 5 stars, love Denis Quaid."
B009GX6F10 I love this show! It started really slow, and took some time to get into. But now, I can't get enough of these characters. The writing is good, the acting is great! The plots are intriguing."
B009GX6F10 &#34;A-B-C, its easy as 1-2-3, formula entertainment for you and me.&#34; That's about it folks great brainless entertainment about the early days of Vegas but even the costumes are overdone with far too much sheen and look fake. Just like the simple plot, e-z script, la-di-da acting, good casting, and perfect encapsulated ending. With just one season the game is over. Vegas crapped out. Everybody wins."
B009GX6F10 Good honest fun show.  Not Vegas but then what is?  Living in Vegas since 63 I find this to mirror some of Vegas but is candy coated for TV.  Ralph Lamb and his Brother Darwin OWNED this town for 20 years and while Ralph was Sheriff no one screwed up.  They minimized what he actually did to law breakers.  Folks who were thieves were \"rumored\" to find themselves out at the state line in underpants and nothing else after a VERY long and sound beating.  The Lambs were not everyone's cup of tea but as a law abiding person they took care of the town and no one messed with them."
B009GX6F10 We do enjoy Amazon's streaming programs, Vegas is a fun series  WITH NO COMMERICALS, it's hard to watch regular TV with all the enteruptions  in your viewing a program, so we do like these series shows."
B009GX6F10 I was heartbroken they cancelled this series! STUPID NETWORKS! You will not be disappointed by this show, great acting, and we loved all the characters."
B009GX6F10 This has the best of what it was probably the best showing of early Vegas starting up. Then the western or cowboy sheriff, brother and son. It's a tightrope walk every episode, between who's going to be caught, or not."
B009GX6F10 Vegas is a great show. It has good well developed characters played by outstanding seasoned actors. Although the story line could be just another cops and robbers, the setting, the unique psychology and varied motivation of each character makes for an interesting and engaging show."
B009GX6F10 The blurb up on the initial description has the stars wrong.  Josh Duhamel and James Caan? Woops!Fun to watch, the era is attractive."
B009GX6F10 This is the best show, historically, that I have seen in the last couple of years. This is in regards to TV shows. I love the chemistry between Dennis Quad & Jason O'Mara (as native Nevada / Las Vegas) and Michael Chiklis (as the Mobster). This is one of my favorite shows."
B009GX6F10 I can't say this was anything on the brilliant side of writing but the characters, the settings and the dialogue sure keep you watching. The stories are good and wrap up mostly by the end of each episode with a few lines to keep weaving through. Dennis Quaid is spooky as the sheriff - scary grin and all. Good guys vs bad guys always make for a good show, and the lovely cars and airplanes of that era are sure worth added value. I remember when women really dressed up like that... nice series."
B009GX6F10 Interesting stories of Vegas during the Mob years and a local sheriff that has to deal with the criminal acts.The show wasn't given a chance to expand the stories."
B009GX6F10 My kids used to remark about an old joke that it was old when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. This formula about an aggressive, honest, opinionated sheriff taking on a saloon-keeper in the wild and wooly American West is far from original.  It is not well acted, directed or conceived.  I expected much better from the cast.  One cultural stereotype after another with many murders, jurisdiction challenges, and righteous indignation.  How much a relief it would be if life were like that...."
B009GX6F10 This program is fun to watch.  I like the fact that Michael Chiklis plays the bad guy but really isn't that bad.....love his character."
B009GX6F10 Note: I saw every episode of this series in HD via XFinity On Demand.from the writers of Goodfellas comes a true-story drama about how Vegas became the town it is today. The cast is first-rate, and each episode bubbles with surprises. I particularly like the scenes with Aimee Garcia & Taylor Handley. They were great together.Shame CBS cancelled this series, though thematically (Vegas becoming what it is today), I don't see how it could have lasted more than one season, but dramatically, there was maybe more room to explore the characters. Guess we'll never know. But at least, it didn't leave us hanging."
B009GX6F10 Michael Chiklis made a name for himself as a badass in The Shield.  This time, on the other side of the badge, Chiklis is Vincent Savino, a Chicago affiliated mobster who has been to Las Vegas to run the Savoy Hotel and Casino.  Savino's also charged with expanding the empire of the mob.Randy Quaid plays Ralph Lamb (based on a real character) who was appointed sheriff because of his Army MP stint.  Ralph and Vincent go head to head and occasionally side-by-side in this often gritty portrayal of the 1950 and 1960s Las Vegas."
B009GX6F10 My husband an I really loved this show. It was one of the good ones, but I guess there was not enough nudity and sex in it to keep some people interested. This show had a story to it as well as one not readily seen; unlike these scummy little sitcoms where every week they think up a new reason to jump out of their clothes and into bed!"
B009GX6F10 OK, so what if Vegas was NEVER uncomplicated or simple.  It was certainly less crowded.Dennis Quaid shines as &#34;Man's Man, good-old-boy Rancher turned Sheriff&#34; Ralph Lamb.Jason O'Mara is fun to watch getting in and out of trouble as Jack Lamb, Ralph's younger brother who serves as his deputy.  (Who knew the love of a woman could be so painfully complicated and difficult?)Speaking about difficult love, Sarah Jones was well cast as Mia Rizzo (the light of Jack's life), too bad she's also responsible for skimming Savoy funds for the Mob.Nobody does bad like genuinely nice guy Michael Chiklis, who seems to have a great deal of fun playing Vincent Savino.  You just know he and lamb are eventually going to form some sort of alliance.As Dixon Lamb, Ralph's son, Taylor Handley has his moments, but sort of falls short of the mark.  Then again a lot of Vegas sort'a kind'a falls short of the mark.Perhaps one too many clich&eacute;s ... ever cheery mob boss Savino with a heart of gold ... mafia princess Mia with a heart of gold who's psycho mafia Dad (played to the hilt by character actor Michael Wiseman) tries to kill his daughter's cop boyfriend James, with fists, guns, cattle prods and more ... lascivious movie mogul played by Peter Jacobson of &#34;Starter Wife&#34; fame.  I could go on and on and on ... but you get the drift.  Vegas tries too hard, with a LOT of really good actors, but unfortunately falls way too short in the process.At the end of the season we're left wondering what's going to happen to Porter Gainsley (played by consummate villain actor Michael Ironside).  Sadly for the show, Gainsley has been turned into the redneck equivalent of an unstoppable sociopath terminator robot out for EVERYONE's blood.Evil Gainsley enjoys killing people ... a LOT.  He killed Lamb's wife, put Lamb's sort'a kind'a girlfriend, DA Katherine O'Connell (played by Carrie-Anne Moss, you'll remember her as Trinity in The Matrix) in a coma.  It doesn't pay to get too close or too attached to sheriff Lamb ... or any other of the Lamb brothers ... while Gainsley or the Mob's around.  Oh wait, sheriff Lamb and Selvino are working together to take down Gainsley.  Anyone else getting a headache?Don't get me wrong, I love the show and am sad it's been canceled, because it's always had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately the ratings haven't been great, but then that's an other story.Internet based TV numbers aren't counted as ratings, so good programs die, because only live ratings counts.  Which leaves us with programs like &#34;The Voice&#34;, &#34;American Idol&#34; and &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34; (shudder)."
B009GX6F10 You can't fail here, this show is very awsome! I think it hits on everything you could want in a series about the early days of a young Vegas. A Must Watch! I look forward to watching this for years!"
B009GX6F10 Dennis Quaid over acts,the Chicago mob is not going to be hampered by a cow boy and his family. they solve everything to easy"
B009GX6F10 1/12/13 - very good evolution, including interaction (and a showdown) between the mob with the \"old guard\" (Mormon ranchers).  If you have not watch yet, catch up.  Looking forward to the 2nd half of the season.NO SPOILERS:Of all the new programs circa 2012, Vegas by far has the most impressive cast.Starting with movie actor Dennis Quaid, as the new Sheriff and Michael Chiklis (\"The Shield\" and \"The Commish\"), as the mob boss who was sent to Vegas by the \"Outfit\" (Chicago Mob) because of his casino management experience in Cuba.  Add to mix \"The Matrix's\" Carrie-Ann Moss, as the sexy Assistant DA (a local that is back from a stint living in NYC) and fine character actor Jason O'Mara (\"Life on Mars\"). Then there is Co-Producer Nicholas Pileggi (\"Goodfellas\", \"Casino\" and \"American Gangster\")With some latitude allowed, given the constraints of American Network TV, I still would liked to have seen more \"grit\", as reflective of Vegas in the early 1960's.  By way of an example, premium cable does an excellent portrayal of Miami during the same timeframe with \"Magic City\".  It is a balancing act for sure, though considering that \"Vegas\" is not represented as a family show (10:00 PM start time), I am curious to see what liberties will be taken.With such a veteran cast, it could take some time for everyone to find their respective places.  At the very least \"Vegas\" is worth gambling on (pun intended) additional episodes."
B009GX6F10 Why did Vegas not  have more people talking about it?Even my teenagers got into this great show.I would recomend this show to everyone I know."
B009GX6F10 It was better than I expected.  Good acting and really reminiscent of the early days of Vegas.  Now I'm glad I missed it onTV and get to watch it on Prime."
B009GX6F10 This show could have been so much better, but since they had to get the characters sooo involved with so many other things, it really took away from the main theme of the show. You should have let Michael Chiklis be a mean and nasty hamster too."
B009GX6F10 sad to see that (unlike some British period dramas), this wasn't given a chance. the stories, characters and setting were compelling and made a great watch. networks are too trigger happy with ratings."
B009GX6F10 I loved it.  It's my kind of show. I wonder why it wasn't renewed or picked up elsewhere.  I loved  Dennis Quaid and his family, on this show.  They made the series. Maybe with enough attention they might try again...... we can only hope."
B009GX6F10 This has it all, high drama, credible plot, family feuds, emotional highs and lows , the thin line between good guys and bad guys.  When does a cop cross the line and become a bad guy as Dennis Quade comes close to teaming up with the mob.  The mob, on the other hand, has its good guys and bad guys and at times you really like the bad guy who becomes a good guy just trying to keep his job, just like any other corporate manager. There is something for everyone here, love, sensuality, intrigue, intelligence, mystery, tough guys and sexy women.  What's not to like?  Keep this show going, its a keeper."
B009GX6F10 Dennis Quaid is fantastic as Sheriff Lamb-  defensive, tight as a drum, with an absolute sense of right and wrong.  All other actors in the drama are astonishing, a very palpable real world is created (the fast moving, tense, beautiful, corrupt beginnings of Las Vegas, Nevada as major resort/gambling destination), it's fun (ranchers, showgirls, money, horses), committed but doesn't take itself too seriously.The Michael Chiklis role of Vincent Savino, who runs the casino for his Chicago bosses should be studied by every show runner alive on the planet.  He is genuinely charming, has genuinely kind impulses, but is also blindly ambitious and on a disastrous path.Chiklis the actor is so appealing, and the character as written has enough nuance that the viewer LIKES the bad guy character.  This is crucial when the good guy is so strong and dreamy--  and has a dreamy brother and dreamy son who work with him in the sheriff's office wearing jeans, riding horses and fighting wrong-doers."
B009GX6F10 The characters are good, but Dennis Quaid has two facial expressions - tight-lipped and tighter-lipped. It's rather slow to get moving, but interesting enough that I'll keep with it."
B009GX6F10 I remember Vegas in the 60's.  Took me back and it was funDidn't see any of the nasty business that goes on in the show.  But I'm sure it did I was busy being a kid at a neat hotel with a pool I could jump in any time I wanted.  ."
B009GX6F10 dennis quaid is very good in this. i highly recommend it.it brought back a lot memories seeing the old cars in this show."
B009GX6F10 Love the story line.  I am already regretting that this is the only season though that is available I have a feeling it is going to leave me hanging."
B009GX6F10 I liked it.  I've seen better on TV and I've watched alot worse.  Love all the old behemoth cars and the time frame.  Of course, Dennis Quaid isn't too shabby either."
B009GX6F10 If you have watched all you can of Justified, this is a fairly good substitute. Minus the eye candy. I do like it. It took me watching and few, but I do appreciate this Prime program also."
B009GX6F10 the always excellent Dennis quaid finally moves into a tv series, after decades of leading man roles it was bound to happen and it happened in a good way! With this solid tv show that returns viewers to a long ago vegas where the mafia really had alot of influence , they actually didn't control most of the casinos , they did control some of them though. Michael chiklis is a fine villian and this is almost as good as the 1980's tv show that michael mann did. The show is a hit show and for good reason , it's just a solid show with a solid storyline and exceptional film quality in cgi and studio set recreations. A++."
B009GX6F10 Great casting and the storyline becomes more interesting with each episode.  Pulling for the Lamb family and even tolerating the mobster due to his soft side."
B009GX6F10 Police work in the raw.  This series takes you back to the 60's when police work was done with a lot of gut instinct.  I love both of the lead protagonists.  They have a kind of respect for one another, but won't hesitate to put one or the other down if need be.  I live in Las Vegas and background scenery is spectacular.  I hope another season is in the works."
B009GX6F10 I have not finished watching this series. My husband and my self really are enjoying it. It is fun to see Vegas as it was when I was there in the 60's."
B009GX6F10 Just when you think he'll flip out his cell phone . . .oops! no cell phones in the 60's. Really authentic. Clothes, sets, props and acting remind me of my childhood. Well done!"
B009GX6F10 Vegas a decent series...I don't what it is but its missing something. I love that all the old Las Vegas scenes, it's a nice look into what Vegas looked like back in the day! In my opinion this series will not last long... maybe if the writers picked up their game a bit it will make it!"
B009GX6F10 The whole story and series was rather dull and predictable. The last five episodes were far more engaging and built up to something but the series was not renewed. The sub stories of a sheriff's romance with a gambling casino moll and the son's romance with a movie starlet were ludicrous and poorly acted. Don't waste your time."
B009GX6F10 I really wanted this to be a 5 star series but its not. I like both the main actors and had high expectations but have been disappointed at the &#34;tough cowboy&#34; &#34;though mob guy&#34; wooden acting. The set for outside the casino is so bad, even today the Fremont street area is not that shiny!If you want to watch a really good series about Vegas in the 60's watch Crime Story&#8230;..better acting, better sets, better cars & way better music. The series starts in Chicago but moves to Las Vegas after the first 2 seasons."
B009GX6F10 Great storyline. I love the 50s 60s cars and music. Reconstructed old Fremont Street. Cowboys and Mafia. Very entreating with a great cast. MORE!"
B009GX6F10 Well-executed excursion into an earlier era in a still-young Las Vegas. Fascinating contrasts between the original ranching culture and the urban gambling industry newcomers.  Would have gotten six stars, except that the season's ending seemed forced, as if the ongoing story lines had to be wrapped up prematurely."
B009GX6F10 I looked forward to this show as Las Vegas had been one of my favorite destinations especially the Fremont street area in the decades from the 1960's through the 1990's. I went to gamble and the Strip was not the place to do that sort of fun activity, poor odds and game rules.  So as I look at this show as regards the entertainment factor I can say it's OK.  Scripts were predictable, characters were cardboard standups, a
B009GX6F10 The show was pretty good.  Kind of corny at times.  But , ok. Too bad there wasn't another season made."
B009GX6F10 This was a very action packed drama series.  It had many great actors who played great parts. They kept you on the edge of your seat at all times. It was really worthwhile to watch."
B009GX6F10 Fun, exciting and lot's of action.  Settings for the show were quite believeable for showing how it was in the 50 - 60's.  Acting was acceptable.  Only downside is it was a bit predictable."
B009GX6F10 Excellent presentation of the story of a developing Las Vegas and the players that shaped the city. The acting, costuming, sets, plots, scripts and casting are all top notch. Highly recommended."
B009GX6F10 Lots of drama, romance and a great story line.  Too bad they ended after the first season.  Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis were awesome in the lead."
B009GX6F10 This is a good show. My wife even likes it which makes it a pleasure to watch a show together.It gives an interesting take of the rise of Las Vegas. Too bad it didn't last longer than the single season."
B009GX6F10 I really tried to like this show, but the storyline did not grab me. the actors are good, but not great."
B009GX6F10 I can't believe that they cancelled this show. Very entertaining and a different police show than the standard CSI or Law and Order."
B009GX6F10 This show will surprise you. The  sets are so so 1960's .  The story lines  are modern day. Acting is a bit um b list.. On the whole good show."
B009GX6F10 It is hard to keep my attention. I've seen so many TV Cop shows they all seem to use the same script with some tweaking. This one did come up with a novel theme. So it was more tolerable and entertaining than many-many others."
B009GX6F10 I love this show, it looks like it is going to be cancelled, such a waste.  If they'd give it time, I think it would grow into a real hit.  The story lines are engaging, the acting is wonderful.  The premise is unique and interesting.  Shows which are different need a time to grow, it is a pity this show will not be given that chance."
B009GX6F10 After watching this show, I was bummed that I didnt take the time to catch the show when it was on tv. Not a great show but entertaining. Which is why you watch these shows to begin with."
B009GX6F10 I'm late coming to this series, but man how I do love it!  I resisted watching it, feeling that the premise was hokey ... But, the writers really deftly maneuver around this difficult time period in both American history & in the history of Vegas.  You will LOVE the Lamb clan.  Real men, w/ old fashion values & a true sense of real justice.  Of course, Michael Chiklis was born to play the part of Vinny Savino.  Carrie-Anne Moss was built for the 1960's ... She is gorgeous to behold & a true fashion plate to &#34;accentuate&#34; the costumes of the period.  I did not know of Jason O'Mara prior to this ... Whoa ... What a hunk!  His portrayal of Jack Lamb is so very passionate, w/ his eyes telling most of the story.  Dennis Quaid has always been a walking wet dream in my book ... So, just an all around great show w/ lots of multi-tiered characters to love & to love to hate!"
B009GX6F10 But I may be a bit biased because I not only grew up in Vegas at this time, but also knew the Lamb family. I really love this show, its a time travel show for me. I can't wait for season Two!"
B009GX6F10 Like the retro style.  Also, the actors are very good.  I love Dennis Quaid!The show is a thumbs up."
B009GX6F10 DO NETWORKS EVER WONDER THAT MAYBE THEIR NEW SHOW DIDN'T WATCHED LIKE THEY WANTED BECAUSE THEY PUT IT ON A NIGHT WHERE THERE ARE SHOWS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THOSE NIGHTS FOREVER AND PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT GOING TO QUIT WATCHING WHAT THEY USUALLY WATCH ON THOSE NIGHTS JUST TO TRY OUT ONE OF THEIR &#34;NEW&#34; SHOWS, WELL THAT IS WHAT I THINK HAPPENED TO VEGAS. THIS SHOW IS REALLY GOOD, WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THE STROY LINE CONGRATS, I MEAN IT IS ABOUT LAS VEGAS BEFORE IT BECAME THE BIG LAS VEGAS, THE SHOW IS REALLY GOOD, BUT AS I SAID I DO BELIEVE THEY PUT IT ON A MONDAY OR TUESDAY NIGHT, AND THERE ARE JUST TO MANY REGULAR SHOWS THAT ARE ON THOSE TWO NIGHTS FOR ANY STATION TO PUT A SHOW UP AGAINST, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE REST OF THE WEEK WHEN THERE IS NOTING ON BUT SITCOMS? MY MOTHER WATCHED IT WHEN IT WAS ON THE AIR & WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT DID NOT COME BACK, SO WHEN I GOT THE CHANCE TO WATCH IT ON AMAZON I DID AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT, SAD FOR THOSE OF US WHO DID."
B009GX6F10 I enjoyed the series, wish there were more seasons.  scenery was nice to see,whould have liked to see more of the ranch he owned."
B009GX6F10 When the show first came out my husband started watching it and kept telling me how good it was.  I didn't watch it because it starts at 10:00 p.m.  My husband kept encouraging me to watch it so I purchased and watched the first episode.  Wow.  Good show.  Dennis Quaid is just perfect as the crusty rancher-turned-sheriff going after the mobsters who are taking over Vegas.  Michael Chiklis is the villain and plays the part to perfection.  He's a true mob guy but trying to be more than that since he apparently wants to make Vegas his permanent home.  He's a mobster trying to be a good guy too.  After watching the first show, I immediately bought the 2nd, then the 3rd and 4th.  I was addicted. I bought them all and look forward to each new episode to see who gets killed and how Sheriff Lamb and his brother and son along with the assitant DA solve these murders."
B009GX6F10 Storyline and the people on the show really come together and make it work. Everything fits together. Very well put together the shows are great and you'll just have to watch it for yourself. When I was in the service about 10yrs ago I was aboard the USS Independance everyday there was a fire it seemed. As far as I know they haven't been caught yet. During the investigation we were looking for a guy about 6' tall, wearing a green utility jacket. he had material in his hands in a public area of the ship reading it.  It appears to be a person to be a could wear the jacket in hostile environment. Protecting the person wearing it. On board a ship there are many area's that are not safe to be wondering around blindly. Such as the flight deck. Very good show. All the actors seem to be working together quite well."
B009GX6F10 Maybe Amazon?  This show is top-rate.  Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis are spot on.  If Vegas is picked up by another network (yes! yes! yes!), the money needs to be there to sustain the quality of writing and cinematography we came to expect in Season 1.  Superlative.  Also, the show deserves to be promoted well and vigorously--not squeezed in and around other scheduling.  CBS blew it.  This show more than deserves a second chance."
B009GX6F10 I have really enjoyed watching this series.  It is a shame they only made one season.  Thank you for putting it on Amazon Prime."
B009GX6F10 Great fun to relive the 60s.  The casting is perfect and the writing fantastic!  Vegas at its grittiest.  I hope the story continues."
B009GX6F10 One of the more compelling new dramas.  I really look forward to watching this show during the week and enjoy the period drama.  The acting is superb."
B009GX6F10 Great series! Great writing! The characters really stay in the 60's focus.I did not watch Vegas until a friend asked me if I was watching and told me how good he thought this series was. It IS extremely good! Dennis Quaid is the perfect actor to portray Sheriff Lamb.I downloaded the whole season (rental) from Amazon for about $19.00. I have one more episode to view. I will surely DVR this series when it returns on cable!"
B009GXUMI2 Private practice keeps things fresh and the story line moving along.  I only wish it was a weekly show!  It was a great spin off from Grey's Anatomy."
B009GXUMI2 This show gets better each season.  I'm so glad that this was available online since my DVR is usually pretty busy!"
B009GXUMI2 I have been watching this show from the start, and I love it!  Every episode is heart wrenching and full of feeling."
B009GXUMI2 Anyone who likes &#34;Greys Anatomy&#34; will like &#34;Private Practice&#34;. I like that the actors' character roles and personalities and interactions change quite a bit on this show. Quite a variety in scenarios. Is very much a DRAMA- very little humor - some episodes can be a bit intense or tedious"
B009GXUMI2 I'm glad that Addison found her man! Though it wouldn't be good without some suprising guest reuniting near the ending. :)They did a wonderful job!"
B009GXUMI2 A complicated series of events were left in question last season involving every major character.  This episode ties together, very nicely, the success/failure/surprise of each using coherent time lines and over lapping of events.  A strong thread brings together the final segment \"Everyone\" with one important person gone forever (no spoiler alert here but I really would like to.  Suffice it to say it is VERY sad.)  A great renewal to the premise and cast of \"The Practice.\""
B009GXUMI2 I was so sad to see it end. I really liked this show and how they all got along. Sure hope everything works out for the actors."
B009GXUMI2 I have watched every season!  I truly hate to see this show end!  AWESOME!  I will miss this show next season!"
B009HNCUYK It seems that the &#34;Law & Order&#34; eriters have been drained of the unique type of ideas that made earlier seasons so exceleent."
B009HNCUYK Of course I had to buy this particular episode. 300th episode. I've watched the show from day one and remembered the case without even having to watch the original episode."
B009HNCUYK This show often hires absolutely wonderful talent to guest star and this episode showcased this aspect by hiring Patricia Arquette.  We open with her looking like a middle aged woman going to daily mass and she looks well into her forties. Shortly thereafter she transforms herself into a street prostitute and you would never know it is the same person. Her importance to the episode is that she is the person a killer on the rampage in the city keeps calling and trying to meet. SVU needs to keep on her night and day to find this killer. Arquette essentially blows every other actor off the screen with this role.For those not familiar with Arquette, she was a leading film actress before turning to tv. She worked with most of the top directors and male stars.  She branched off into tv as she aged.  She starred in her own show MEDIUM for many seasons. She comes from a family of actors, including Roseanna Arquette and David Arquette.A year or so ago this show hired Ann-Margaret to guest star and she likewise put in a performance as an alcoholic which blew everyone else off the screen.  She won an Emmy for that guest star, which Patricia Arquette could easily do as well.  This kind of talent is \"don't miss\" when they do us the favor of appearing on the small screen."
B009HNCUYK Wonderful and back to crimes! I love it love it love it its great so good it freaks me out"
B009HNCUYK Law and Order SVU just keeps getting better and better! It's never a disappointment and this season really intensified and satisfied those naysayers who claim the show's not great without Benson's old partner! Though my wife and I liked Stabler, we are continuing to enjoy the show with the new cast!"
B009HNCUYK I am amazed at how prolific Dick Wolfe(sp?) is, but beyond that, I appreciate the actors who perform on this show and demonstrate what sensitivity is required for a victim of sexual violence and abuse."
B009HNCUYK Liev Schrieber's character SAYS it  - why old women were raped by the Germans and Japanese - not because they were so unattractive.  Because it hurt them, it violated who they were as individuals who had always lived their lives a certain way.His character SAYS it and that makes this episode in a series that I don't particular care for a MUST-SEE.  It's like catching the tongue as the Chinese say - similar to watching the Nazi film about the Titanic."
B009HNCUYK Law and Order SVU is a good show, and the current episodes are much smoother and flow better than the early ones.  I'm amazed that a show can last into its 14th season and still work, but this one definitely does."
B009HNCUYK &#34;Law & Order: SVU&#34; just isn&#34;t the same without Elliot Stabler's character! The show is still coming up with some very creative plots, though."
B009HNCUYK Beautifully acted and written.  A great celebration of 300 episodes of solid writing and performances.  Bittersweet end with an edge of your seat journey getting there.  Highly recommended."
B009HNCUYK I think this show has been freshened up with the addition of new characters.  Hope it has many more years to run"
B009HNCUYK I LOVE THIS SHOW, AND THIS EPISODE I REALLY ENJOYED AND AM SO GLAD TO SEE MIKE TYSON GET SOME GOOD THINGS GOING, AS I FEEL HE PAID HIS TIME AND PUNISHMENT, AND HE DID A GOOD JOB WITH ACTING WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE."
B009HNCUYK I have loved this show from the beginning,but I wouldn't rave about this season, it' s mediocre.The writers are missing something besides Elliot."
B009HNCUYK Patricia is wonderful in this episode.  She portrays a truly decent and worthy human being whose life takes an unfortunate turn as she strives to survive as a single mother.  As is often the case where women are left by husbands, she has to do anything she can to support her children.  There is a happy ending here for a change."
B009HNCUYK I love this program; it shows all different kinds of crimes people commit and how law enforcement finds the perpetrators, as well as the officers sacrifices on behalf of the public they protect."
B009HNCUYK it's a wonderful show that I would watch all day long I thank the writers for being so created. Thank you for it all"
B009HNDCC4 TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 4 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work."
B009HNDCC4 The characters continue to grow and surprise us. Great family fun. Nice to enjoy as a family. My  kids love it, and so do I."
B009HNDCC4 Love Ed Oneil he totally shines in this sitcom. Crazy show that truly depicts how wrong things can go in modern life. Everyone in the show is funny they do an amazing job making you laugh."
B009HNDCC4 In case you have not noticed, the tv network sitcom is dying.  The few left in competition with this show have either been cancelled for next season, are on cable, are on BBC America or are the new combination called dramedy, like Nurse Jackie and The Big C (a mix of comedy and drama). This show and the THE MIDDLE are about the only two left which I watch on network tv.  They are both great and are released together.If you've never watched it, it is about an extended family in LA and their attempts to get along. There is the patriarch who is remarried to a younger Colombian wife.  There is his son, a gay lawyer with a football playing, farm boy, musical comedy partner.  They have an adopted daughter. Finally, there is seemingly the conventional heterosexual daughter with husband and three children.  Ironically, it is this last family, four seasons in, which now seems the craziest part of the extended family.For those of you who have watched it by now you have probably vacillated, as have I, on your favorites.  It took me awhile but hands down my favorite is now Phil, played by Ty Burrell, the real estate salesman. He is the most developed, nuanced, and comedic of all of these characters.  I love every moment he is onscreen. Originally I liked the gay couple most but that has waned some since their main comedic bit is that they are gay.  Four seasons in they need to become more nuanced comedically. Phil's wife has also become more nuanced.  She can be a real pain at times and thus a terrific foil for Phil.Another reviewer here has commented that the Colombian accent bit used by Gloria with her husband Jay has become grating and they need to cut that back by twenty percent.  Until he wrote this I hadn't realized it but it has become grating.  Her thick Colombian accent four seasons later is just not that funny.I also enjoy the way all of the kids are coming along, especially Phil's kids in interaction with him."
B009HNDCC4 These characters and their lighthearted machinations keep me laughing and uplifted.  I am thankful for the wit and imagination that the writers and actors gift us with for twenty minutes each week!"
B009HNDCC4 This has to be one of the funniest shows on in my humble opinion which is one reason why this series not only keeps getting awards, but also why this series stays on the TV lineup. I love the story and plot as well as the characters. The actors in this series completely make you believe that they are who they say they are and you get a true sense of family (though sometimes dysfunctional at times). This season did not disappoint and gave the viewer the humor and writing that you have come to expect. You really get to know the characters this season and if you missed any of the season itself, you are truly going to love it. On top of this the Blu-ray has some great add-ons that any fan will love!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*"
B009HNDCC4 when this show first started it was very funny, but i think thay are running out of things to write about, the show has lost its family freindlieness."
B009HNDCC4 I've loved this show since season 1 and unlike many series that have a strong first season and then fizzle, Modern Family is still going strong. It's smart, witty and fun. I can't wait to see the rest of season 4!"
B009HNDCC4 I watch one TV show in the week and it's Modern Family. Love this show!! Since it IS the only TV  I watch, I have all 3 seasons onmy Kindle and enjoy reruns the 2nd or 3rd time around."
B009HNDCC4 The Jay Pritchett family is back in the groove in Season 4 of MODERN FAMILY. Big changes are afoot as Jay's gorgeous and much younger latina wife Gloria (Sofia Vergara) is about to make an addition to the family. MODERN FAMILY takes us on a delightful ride through the lives of this blended family. Gay son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet)already have an adopted daughter from Vietnam and are looking to also make an addition to their family. Daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) and her husband Phil (Ty Burrell)continue their antics as parents raising three boisterous kids. Although this blended family never seems to be in agreement, one this is certain - family bonds run strong and their unity and love makes MODERN FAMILY glow.Gloria and Phil have always been my favorities. Fiery, sexy, and saucy Gloria heats up the screen every time we see her. Lovable Phil is the goofy father that would embarrass any child but his innocence and purity of love for his family makes any of wish we had had a father like Phil. Phil loves Claire but has a harmless secret attraction to Gloria and it is fun to watch them interact. Phil would never cheat on Claire but one wonders what goes through his fantasy mind when around Gloria.Season 4 centers on Gloria's pregnancy and the impending birth of her and Jay's child. Nothing will be the same for Jay as he turns 65 and is about to be a father. Somehow it will all work out and we always know that. Child prodigy Manny (from Gloria's previous marriage) has formed a strong bond with stepfather Jay. Manny is a teenager trapped in the body of a 50-year old.  The three Dunphy kids are still giving their parents joy and grief. The two daughters Haley and Alex follow so many cliches in TV families--Haley is slow-witted, gorgeous and boy crazy while sister Alex is the brains of the family and the never causes a problem kid. It's son Luke (Nolan Gould) who really stands out this season. Quirky and somewaht oafish like his father, Luke has a spark this season. His monotone way of speaking and his vacant eyes are giving away to something special. It will be interesting to see how his character develops as he matures.MODERN FAMILY is the lovable but annoying family that most of wish we had had. The family is unified in their love and their joy is evident. It's one of the best comedies on TV and a great source of joy and satisfaction for the viewer."
B009HNDCC4 A new family member joins the clan this season, as Gloria (Sofia Vergara) finds herself unexpectedly pregnant.Meanwhile, there's change at the Dunphy's, as Haley (Sarah Hyland) goes off to college...and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) struggle to adjust to having NO change, as their attempts to adopt a sibling for Lily fail. On the edge of beginning high school, Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) struggle with peer pressure and gaining new independence.And, as always, each episode is laugh-out-loud funny, full of witty cracks, misunderstandings between family members and all sorts of unexpected hilarity. Four seasons in, this show is still as fresh as it was at the start!"
B009HNDCC4 Now, I'm going to admit I thought the show was pretty funny when it first came on. But midway through the fist season, the child actors started to get on my nerves, they wernt acting like kids, they were acting like snotty adults. I stopped watching for a while, then I caught a couple reruns on USA Network, the new baby is just awful and annoying. And one thing that bothers me is that they completely ignore the cameras. I know they aren't suppose to act like the cameras are around in a documentary, but its not like a movie theater will allow a camera crew in a movie theater with copyrighted stuff in it? just come on"
B009HNDCC4 Love the stories. Best show on currently! When will season 5 start? Or is that it? It may have gone to syndication already."
B009HNDCC4 Modern Family is such a funny show.  I like how they have taken a family and given 3 different aspects on how family life is.  Don't want to give away to much of the story but I really enjoy all the actors and actresses.  If I am not mistaken I believe the show won an Emmy again this year for best Comedy but not 100% sure because I don't want the Emmys."
B009HNDCC4 I thought the family sit-com had been done to death. But this show is great. The acting, the stories, the camera work, it is all brilliantly down. It is a show about a family, there is the tough old patriarch with a hot young wife and her persnickety son. The old man's daughter who is married to a good natured clown and has three kids. There is her brother who is married to another man with an adopted daughter. This show has everything and the jokes are intelligent."
B009HNDCC4 Season four does not disappoint, funny and witty writing as usual, I think Ed O'Neil has always been the &#34;star&#34; of the show but I think with this season all the characters have been developed even more and they are all equally as funny and mesh exceptionally well together!"
B009HNDCC4 The writing makes everyday activities hilarious.  When it does decide to go into low-brow mode, even funnier!  I purchased this show because I love to gawk at Sofia Vergara, but also all the characters and actors are extremely solid at what they do for a living.  Thank you for an uplifting, light-hearted show!"
B009HNDCC4 Still love Modern Family! I think it's just one of those magic shows that just works all the way around. Great writing, perfect casting and consistently hilarious."
B009HNDCC4 We are a comedy family.  Modern Family is by far the most favorite one in our house.  Not only is if funny, but you can related to the families and their interactions."
B009HNDCC4 I actually stopped watching this show. I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought. It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons. A friend told me to give this episode a try. This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time. Still this show has tanked a lot."
B009HNDCC4 I love the character &#34;Jay&#34; and really appreciate that the writers of this program allow at least one male lead to sometimes appear intelligent, strong and compassionate. The kids are a scream.  Great acting all around!"
B009HNDCC4 Sometimes as the seasons continue to roll on with sit-coms it can feel that the writers run out of things to do. This series has not fallen into that and continues to be hilarious. The characters continue to be funny and the writing has stayed witty. This show can be enjoyed on many levels."
B009HNDGLG Riley Keough and Juno Temple star in Jack & Diane which is basically a love story between two young women and disguised as a warewolf story as well. But the whole warewolf storyline was pretty much vacant and nothing, and I mean NOTHING happens in this movie. The writer/director couldn't create a full and compelling story, the writing is flat, the acting is only really good from Juno Temple, and the direction is sloppy. And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud! I just didn't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane, they fall in love way too quickly and I can't figure out why they do? This movie is pointless and I'm only giving it 2 stars (way too generous, I know) because of Temple's performance."
B009HNDGLG None of it is Amazons fault, just a real bad movie. Had a good story line they could have done so much more."
B009HNDGLG Heh, just kidding.  I wasn't expecting Mellencamp to appear.  Would have been incredibly awkward and out of place if he had!Well Jack & Diane is by no means a horror flick.  No way!  Unless the short moments where a scary monster appears out of nowhere are supposed to be considered scary.  They *do* admittedly happen suddenly in a way that a good horror film is supposed to do however these moments happen few and far between so I don't believe this is a horror move based on the few times the monster makes an appearance, haha.So basically what we have here is instead a romance between a young boy and girl... or young girl and girl.  Between Dane DeHaan and Juno Temple.  For the sake of making it simple, let's just put it that way.  If I look at the film from a relationship building point of view, instead of a horror or suspense, the movie works surprisingly well.  Then again if it says horror in the title but doesn't really deliver in that regard, shouldn't I fault the movie?  Yes I should, and I am!  Which is why I'm taking away one star.  But geez, the romance between two young teens (at least, they look younger than they really are- MUCH younger) accurately captures the shyness and awkwardness pertaining to two teens wanting each other badly but not knowing how to talk to the other (which incidentally takes up a large portion of this film in the first half).  This stuff works so well!  The writing's definitely stellar, it's just not horror-like.  At all.I don't know if the frequent nosebleeds were ever explained other than we're left to assume Juno's character has some kind of chronic disorder.  I've personally never heard of a chronic nosebleed problem (unless you take certain types of medication or unless you pick your nose too much!)  The whole nosebleed story is a bit awkward, never properly explained and unnecessarily long-winded to me.Anyway \"Jack\" and Diane fall in love (\"Jack\" has to be in quotation marks because he's a boy pretending to be a girl, even though I didn't know this until I finished watching the movie and came online to read about it).  Their relationship goes through typical young teen ups and downs.  I can't remember if their ages were stated, but it's remarkable just young how both Dane DeHaan and Juno Temple appear in this movie.  They look no older than 12-14 even though they were actually in their early 20's when making this movie.Juno is just SO adorable!  How could anyone not love her?  The difficulties she faces with her family is another noticeable high point of the storytelling, and the song that is played during the final scene with Juno totally reminds me of Tracey Ullman's \"They've Never Been\" and I'm convinced it's a remade version of the same song (at least, parts of it sound identical).So there you have it.  Whether girls are having relationships with girls or boys with boys, this aspect is all very confusing for me and went over my head big time.  However just focus on the fact it tells a great story between two young teens.  Then it's easy to interpret and enjoyable to watch.  Also make sure you ignore the horror elements.  If you think the story is building slowly (VERY slowly might I add- one of the slowest moving storylines I've seen in a while) to a graphic and horrific blood-soaked skin ripping conclusion, guess again."
B009HNDGLG Jack and Diane appealed a lot to me at first glance. The uniquely sounding blend of romance and horror is something that definitely is up my alley. However upon viewing this very strange and offbeat drama, it wasn't quite what I would have expected. The main thing that left me hanging was the horror aspect. After waiting for the horror to arrive, at the end the only real horror elements were a few sequences that didn't quite deserve a `horror' genre tag on the film. I'm used to films not being what they are marketed as, so that wasn't a huge deal. However something else just had me put off through the most of the film. The two main actresses (Juno Temple and Riley Keough) have next to no charisma. Between the huh's and what's, not a whole lot is said. They're trying to make us believe they're lovers, having fallen in love at first sight, but their characters give us no real reason to believe so aside from making out whenever convenient. The \"horror\" elements come into play, making more of a metaphorical contribution, and give the film a unique experimental feel and dark tone. There are also a few scenarios that work their way in, not having any major relation to anything going on in the movie, that really had me not wanting to look away. I had a hard time putting my finger on this film. I didn't love jack and Diane, but at the same time it had me wanting to keep watching. As a unique and weird teenage romance, the film has a lot of cool things going on for it. But as a whole, it seemed kind of lost, not sure of which one of its features it wanted to pay the most attention to.Source: criticnic.com 3 April 2013Disclosure: Film sent by Magnolia Pictures"
B009HNDGLG this is a slow movie, not a lot of dialog, and the werewolf part is silly, but the actresses are both excellent and had some chemistry, which works for me, also i am biassed being i like juno temple so by no means rent this on my review."
B009HNDGLG I could not watch this all the way through. I gave up on it about half way. Not my cup of tea and I like gay themed movies."
B009HNDGLG I was quite impressed by the acting chops of Keough and Temple. The story was interesting and the reactions depicted by the young women were believable. I also thought the special effects were unusual and stimulating. This movie is not for young kids. Older kids may need some guidance when dealing with the subject matter."
B009HNDGLG I'm not sure how this ended up in the horror section, if you need to put it in a category I would say Indie/Gay/Lesbian, but it is a really good movie about first love between two teenage girls. I thought it was a very well done movie but most people will shy from this type of film. It is a realistic portrayal of uncomfortable silences, petty jealousies and hard goodbyes. I loved it."
B009HNDGLG Although I've yet to see the concluding chapter of \"Twilight,\" I can't image it would be any worse than this mess.  Here we have 2 teen age girls, both with issues who meet, get friendly then bleed, vomit and cough up teeth on each other.  I'm not sure if director Bradley Rust Gray was trying to make a horror film, but the film is horrible.The horror element comes in often as Diane (Juno Temple, \"The Dark Knight Rises\") who also has an identical twin, has nightmares (which we get to enjoy) of some sort of monster (werewolf?)  I couldn't quite figure it out.  We see this growth of long hair, blood, teeth and internal organs mixed into the visuals.  It never makes sense as to what it is or why she has the dreams.Diane also seems like the needy, fair-weather lesbian, just there for the moment, whereas Jack (Riley Keogh, \"Magic Mike\") is the real deal.  Butch in all ways.  That's about it.  Just 110 minutes with two sour-faced unlikeable young women.  Not funny, not sexy, not interesting, not emotional, not educational.  I needed a shower after I watched it...the warm kind.The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Shot in 35 mm film, it looks very good on Blu ray.  Film grain remains and clarity is good for the most part.  Skin tones are spot on as are most of the colors.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialog centric so the surrounds don't come into play often.  Sometimes with ambient noise but rear channels come alive with the nice soundtrack.  Extras include a 10 minute doc about the special effects, an AXS-TV promo, a trailer and other Magnolia features."
B009HNDGLG This is a great movie with two great and upcoming actrices. A minor problem is the vision of the director who obviously contributed to the script. He wanted to make a strong point about love (...love is a monster, as stated on the cover) and what grows inside you! I think that he failed miserably but the cast saved the movie in spite of the script.Very simple story and great performances by Juno Temple and Riley Keough. Jack (Riley Keough) meets Diane (Juno Temple) and they fall in love. We follow their passion through the movie with very few words. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is just fabulous. The problem as stated in the intro is the vision of the monster inside you which if deleted would have made a perfect movie.Four stars for a great love story with great performances from the cast and great direction. However, love is NOT a monster, love is beautiful and fulfilling!"
B009HONRO6 Great Show, Cast & Writing. So funny in an off beat way! Tina Fey did an awesome job with this series!"
B009HONRO6 NBC has cancelled this show because it needs to do better in the ratings.  Its odds of coming up with something better are about nil, especially given its recent track record. Getting rid of this show, one of its best ever, is yet another miscalculation on its part and I expect the network to only sink further.  Except for SNL, I don't think I will be watching NBC at all once this goes off the air.What is going on in this season is that all the characters are being wound up so that as the show closes you are not left in limbo about what happened to these characters.  This means that there are marriages in store for some of these characters.  There is a meaningful death. There is, above all, great humor in each and every episode.I will miss most of all Alec Baldwin playing Jack and I only hope he goes on to play another comedic character on tv.  I'm sure he'll be tempted to go back into movies but he has done such a spectacular job on the small screen that I hope he sticks with it. Although he can do drama, comedy is where he really belongs.You cannot go wrong watching this or any season of 30 Rock."
B009HONRO6 love the show, although this is season and the last one were the ones where they &#34;jumped the shark.&#34;  still had to watch it though!!"
B009HONRO6 I have been in awe of the writers and actors of 30 Rock since the beginning.  They never take the easy way out.  Another great show."
B009HONRO6 Many people thing that 30 Rock got canceled. That is not true! Tina Fey wanted to end the seris on a high note. And she defiantly did!"
B009HONRO6 Still a great show and ending on a high note but Tina Fey called it right. It was time to go."
B009HONRO6 I was looking for a break from the heavier shows that I usually watch (Sons of Anarchy, Tudors, Downton Abbey, House of Cards, etc.). I just wanted something light - something I didn't have to think too much about. For instance, I'm now on Scrubs (since I've finished 30 Rock), which fits the bill exactly. However, what I found with 30 Rock, that I do not find with Scrubs, is that the humor is incredibly intelligent. The show is not just a diversion - it's a draw. I wish I could find more comedies like this one. I'll try, but I don't think I'll succeed, because there is only one Tina Fey. I can think of no other reason for the show's brilliance. So I give much of the credit to that one genius of a woman. Of course, Alec Baldwin was fabulous in the show, and I'm not a Baldwin fan. Tracy Morgan and the rest of the cast fill out the show wonderfully."
B009HONRO6 The cast is amazing and the series is great. This show deserves all 5 stars. Tina Fey created a dynamic show! Produced by SNL producer Lorne Michaels, so you know it's gold."
B009HONRO6 First I must praise this sh
B009HX0FM4 Simply put this is the most courageous show on the networks - a sly adult-written parody that sounds like it will be something else but can be a thought provoking, heart warming and out and out LOL guffaw inducing fun!  They know they are a tv show and they play to that....watch it on ABC or Hulu plus for second season.  You will enjoy the rare show that is being itself!"
B009HX0FM4 The first couple are just ok and later into the show you will crack up. The interactions with alien verses human is so funny. Great comeady for the whole family.."
B009HX0FM4 I don't know how such a well-written, quirky, and thoroughly amusing show made it to network tv, but I am SO grateful! AS many of my favorite sitcoms, Parks and Rec, and Big Bang, move toward cruder and cruder and explicit sexual language, I despaired of finding 'truly funny' again, and was ready to retire my tv. Then along came Neighbors! Watch it-it is hands down the funniest show to come on tv in a long time. Very original, every actors is great in this. In the first few shows, the children were pretty wooden and I hoped they would fade into the background, but the writers seemed to have spent some time fleshing them out and their presence now adds to the story line.I love Neighbors night on TV!"
B009HX0FM4 I am so surprised that this is on the network that it is and at the time it is.  It really is funny, but in a black comedy kind of way.  The main thing is two different life forms living with one another and finding out what makes the other tick.  I enjoy watching the show.  But I have a feeling it is going to be canceled before it gets to a second season.  I hope I'm wrong."
B009HX0FM4 I don't know how long it will run...but it is sure to develop a cult following because of the quirky humor."
B009HX0FM4 I love &#34;The Neighbors&#34;!  It's a sweet show about tolerance and acceptance, and all of the actors are just marvelous.  I've watched every episode at least four times (and it hasn't been on that long), and still laugh out loud.  What makes it so exceptional is that, while it is definitely a comedy, there are scenes that have me reaching for the tissues."
B009HX0FM4 The guy who is cast as the 'alien in charge' does great acting.  Supporting cast all do a great job.  The kids do even better.  Very quirky and different.  I highly recommend this show."
B009HX0FM4 I viewed this show on a suggestion from someone and was surprised.It Is different from what I thought and probably won't last long."
B009HX0FM4 This show is truly funny and brings real laughter to my day.  The cast is incredible and they bring life to their characters."
B009HX0FM4 Funny but will this show make it?  I get the feeling it won't make it and the season shows are erratic at best."
B009I7VS2K Chappelle's show but better in every way.  Thank god we've interrupted the flow of trash sketch shows Mind of Mencia helped launch.These guys are unbelievable.  Some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen in my life - the dubstep sketch was gloriously intense, Da Struggle and Bling Benzy sketch cause me to spew beer onto my couch (worth it) and the LMFAO parody sketch had me almost crying by they end.If you don't like this show your humor is broken.  :)"
B009I7VS2K I can honestly say that Key & Peele is really funny and I truly like Peele's Barack Obama impersonation. Also, this show is very creative."
B009I7VS2K We really enjoyed Season 2 of Key & Peele and wish the season was longer. Season 1 (especially the first episode) was funnier but we still laugh like crazy at least once per episode."
B009I7VS2K These two men are downright hysterical. Both having the same ethnic background, these two comedians work great with each other. This is a sketch comedy show and stand up at the same time. Both events are funny because they can see situations from different cultural aspects; they call it black vs white (more on the lines of ghetto vs civil). But the sketches they do not regarding race are pretty funny as well.Just watch it to see for yourself. It'll make you laugh."
B009I7VS2K Very funny! The new Dave Chapell Show! Real world comedy show that hits all the hot topics that others are afraid to address."
B009I7VS2K No one and no topic is safe from their humorous comedic onslaught, they even put each other on the spot taking turns being the joke. They are today's version of Smother's Brothers only free and uncensored to bring out all the worlds shortfalls."
B009I7VS2K If you are a young American or a least not a card carrying member of the Republican Party, you will enjoy this series.  I understand that Key and Peele are both bi-racial, so the have a special empathy for the president and their skits are race conscious.  So if you are, in the famous words of Stephen Colbert, &#34;someone who doesn't see color&#34; you may not see the humour in this show either."
B009I7VS2K i thought this was very funny and enjoyed there funny,sick,warped humor short skits on presidential joking to teachers and more 5 stars"
B009I7VS2K Key and peel are hilarious.  They make me laugh.  I saw them first on YouTube. I want more Key and peel"
B009I7VS2K So funny you will pee your pants and laugh some more! Love this show and the 2 comedians that lead the comedy!"
B009I7VS2K these guys are funny! Even when I'm busy in another room and can't see the screen, they are hilarious!!! You will not be disappointed."
B009I7VS2K Smart, clever, funny, irreverent, and charming!  You can always count on a belly laugh when watching Key & Peele.  They push the envelope and can throw PC out the window--if you like smart comedy, then watch!"
B009I7VS2K A direct chappelle rip off in some ways. However they are fresh and funny.  They ride the fine line of racist jokes with a humorous awareness."
B009I7VS2K Great !  I end my day each evening with an episode before bed to put a smile on my face and to clear away the daily troubles."
B009I7VS2K I really found these guys to be humorous, especially when they both used to be on MAD TV. This sketch comedy, every episode, makes me laugh. I've watch a couple of the sketches two or three times over because it makes me laugh. It's worth it."
B009I7VS2K I love this show! One of the funniest on tv! It's also about time for their to be more ethnic diversity in TV comedy!!"
B009I7VS2K Very funny series.  It is not usual for me to want to watch a comedy show nowadays but this one is edgy enough to have me addicted."
B009IF63I6 Dont miss this show its crazy funny. Love Ashton thiink he really added to the show. Seriously dude those sandals have to go. Love the ending of the last show. Its like modern family it really needs to be on 3 times a week..."
B009IF63I6 Although the new premise of the show is not as believable as the original with Charlie Sheen, it still produces a laugh or two because it is well written, and all the characters are still funny. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher, in my opinion he's not much of an actor, but he is adequate for the part. Jon Cryer is still the best part of the show. He's the Barney Fife to whoever is the new sheriff in town. There have been some fun twists in the season, with the character Rose returning to try to get Walden, and some not so fun twists like Miley Cyrus showing up as an annoying chatterbox. I'd say this show is still worth watching, but it should probably conclude next season before the premise runs its course."
B009IF63I6 I never would have believed that this show could go on as successfully as it has without Charlie Sheen, but Ashton Kutcher has pulled it off. Too bad the mother has disappeared from the show."
B009IF63I6 This is the last season of a killer sitcom! Its a shame it has to go! I have to have it for my collection, and so should you baby!"
B009IF63I6 Sad attempt at humor. Poor acting to boot. Why is this a popular series? There is sooo much TV that is good, why does this get good ratings??!!"
B009IF63I6 It's definitely different without Charlie Sheen aka Charlie Harper. I also think Angus T. Jones and his lessened presence as Jake Harper is the reason for his recent outburst regarding the crudeness of the show. Since Ashton Kutcher arrived, the show is about 85% less crude and 50% less funny."
B009IF63I6 This show needs to be cancelled... it's not even funny anymore.  Ashton is an idiot... really can't stand that guy."
B009IF7092 The show continues to make me laugh every time I watch! The cast is great and the story lines don't disappoint! Loved it since I first saw it - I think I will be a fan until the end!"
B009IF7092 I got turned onto this show by my wife. Hilarious show. If you like comedy you need to watch this show. I have been catching up on the seasons  with her and haven't see a bad episode yet"
B009IF7092 This show is very well written.  It can go 14 seasons with cast members getting married and having children.  Sheldon's putdowns towards Leonerd could carryon to his child putting down Lenord's son.  An idea.The show brings a cast of intelligent educated adults with graduate degrees and a farm girl college community dropout, Penny, trying to make it in California as an actress stuck in the middle.  The ongoing differences between Sheldon an intellectual physicist by definition and Penny make the show what it is.  Putting an analitcal, intellegent, &#34;evolved&#34; (as he calls himself, person whom doest not crave human innate desires such as human contact and without a doubt intimacy, in the same room with a free spirit aspiring actress true to her innate desires, is the recipe for humor.Amy Farafauller (Bialik), an intellegent neuerolgist, whom essentially is Sheldon's female equivalent,  high school's desires of befriending the pretty girl in school comes to a reality when meeting Penny.  Dialoges between her and Penny also make for good humor.The friendship between adults (Sheldon, Amy and Penny), whom where complete opposite of another in high school respectively, creates an amusing, humerus dynamic.The only thing bad thing about season six is Wolowitz leaving behind his bacholors days and hanging with Kutropoli, which brought the show's humer down a notch.  Wolowitz is personality as bachelor made humerus contributions to the show no longer seen now as a husband.  on the upside Kutropoli now speaks without the use of Wolowitz, since they no loger are hang out arm to arm.  Its good to see him speak out.Chuck Lore is a genius bringing us unconvetional shows like the Big Bang and Two and Half Man."
B009IF7092 This show never fails to make me laugh and this season is no different. I love, love, love Sheldon and how you never know what to expect from him."
B009IF7092 This show is without a doubt the funniest show on TV. (Okay that's a bit biased) Maybe only ONE of the funniest shows on TV but it's definitely in the running for Funniest."
B009IF7092 On this series, I think I'm getting my money's worth.Episodes for the most part are entertaining.I'm not a big fan of &#34;humiliating the character&#34; type humor, so knocking a star off for some of that.And it seems like the female cast continue to get more and more snarky ( *itchy) as time progresses.B
B009IF7092 I've watched all six seasons and will watch if add long as it runs!  All of the characters are hilarious!"
B009IF7092 i cant believe how hook i am in this show. in the begining i thought this show was stupid but i glad i gave another chance to watch it and now i am hook with this show. i cant wait this fall to come back"
B009IF7092 Still loving the series.  I keep waiting and waiting and waiting for Raj to finally find someone, anyone, and I'm hoping this season won't disappoint."
B009IF7092 I love the writing on this show but Sheldon is the star!  Nerds will live forever and always get the girls!"
B009IF7092 Unfortunately, this show is losing some of its freshness and uniqueness.  They're even trying to promote it as &#34;The New Friends.&#34;  However, partially owing to reruns being driven into the ground by local stations, the episodes have become predictable, and Sheldon and Raj, in particular seem to be out of the writers' range anymore.  Amy and Bernadette have certainly added to the mix, but a lot of the endearing quirkiness seems to be fading."
B009IF7092 You would think that after 6 seasons, this should would start to degrade in quality.  However, unlike other shows, this one seemed to thrive in its sixth season.  They are really pushing the bar and keeping expectations high.  The show also does not rely heavily on past episodes (except in the case of a couple of the to be continued ones).  So one could jump in at any season / episode and still enjoy it."
B009IF7092 I've watched 5 seasons so why not try the 6th for $8. It's still not good and e story line never develops like other shoes that have been on this long. They really need to shake things up"
B009IF7092 Love the show! Super funny! Enjoying it whileit lasts! Before they get into telling to deep of stories and it turns into some weird nerdy soap opera......it always happens......"
B009IF7092 This is the worst season of the series.  The first few seasons had me laughing so hard.  But this season, everything seems so forced.  Penny seems to be more of a miserable lush than previous seasons.  The exchanges between Howard and Bernadette are so dull at times.  I don't know what the heck Raj is doing, but watching a full show stacked with tidbits of a texting date ended up putting me to sleep.  However, I see the progression of Sheldon's character with Amy as an interesting story line and see this as taking center stage instead of the Howard and Bernadette snoozefest and the painful Leonard and Lush Amy storylines soon.  I wish there was not so much angst in those relationships.  It would be funny to see Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny in a competition to see who is the most passionate or romantic couple only to have Sheldon try to join in the competition out of pure competitiveness where he suffers a kiss from Amy for the sake of the cause and make Raj the black horse out of nowhere!"
B009IF7092 First off, I probably would have liked it much better if I hadn't read a spoiler alert.  I knew what to expect and even though it was still a good episode I was kinda put off about a comment made by Amy about Raj.  The poor guy is making progress and I hope to see more of it in the coming new season.  I love BBT and all its quirky characters."
B009IF7092 This show is amazing. Jim Parsons is a comic genius. He continues to get better and better. Maylim Balik is giving him a run for his money."
B009IF7092 GREAT COMEDIC WRITING AND DELIVERY.  A WONDERFUL ENSEMBLE OF CHARACTERS, AND LOADS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENTS.  IT JUST GETS BETTER EACH SEASON"
B009IF7092 this and how i met your mother are two of my current favorite comedies to watch!!  i love each character, watching the reruns on TBS still make me laugh!  a classic like scrubs"
B009IF7092 Verry good season. loved iti wish they would stray from the relationship stuff and get back to nerdy science stuff more but character progression blah blah blah."
B009IF7092 I've been following the work of Chuck Lorre as far back as GRACE UNDER PRESSURE.  Also involve his trademark &#34;vanity cards.&#34;BBTh. is the best of the lot."
B009IF7092 The first time I saw this show was in Shanghai China, it was playing on the only English speaking TV station I could find, and I thought it was OK. Later I decided to buy a season and try it out - I'm always hungry for good comedies and they are few and far between. It turns out now to be one of my favorites shows. It takes a while to understand the dynamics of the characters, but once you do you become hooked."
B009IF7092 this show is side splitting funny thank you for bringing it to my computer. such a funny show very good"
B009IF7092 This is one of those rare shows that makes me laugh out loud often and sends me to YouTube looking for clips of particularly funny scenes."
B009IF7092 I have never laughed so hard, felt so joyful, or marveled at such excellence, in a comedy before. The actors are comedic geniuses. Their timing is impeccable, their delivery perfect. You can't help but LOVE them. This is comedy at its finest. The writers are marvelously innovative and creative, and even the simplest slapstick comedic moments will become epic cultural phenomena. The only other show that even comes close to touching it is Seinfeld. Big Bang is just pure funny through and through, and endearing beyond belief. I live for this show. I own all the seasons and re-watch often. This show is hands-down the most hilarious comedy ever written. Long live The Big Bang Theory."
B009IF7092 Gotta love The Big Bang Theory. If your a geek you will truly enjoy the 6th season. Get it, watch it, bazinga your happy!!!"
B009IF7092 The writing is witty and innovative, the acting is top notch and the characters are off beat, and interesting ."
B009IF7092 One of the best seasons yet. The cast keeps it fresh and new year after year while digging deeper into the character development."
B009IF7092 I love this show and wait in anticipation for each new episode to air. I'm rarely disappointed and always laugh. I highly recommend this show to any and all. Watch it, it's hilarious!"
B009IF7092 I absolutely love this show and download episodes to my kindle so I can watch them while on long plane rides.  I never get tired of watching these episodes and see the characters evolve. Love it!"
B009IF7092 I have loved Big Bang Theory from the beginning but it's starting to seem like same old, same old this season. I would like to see Sheldon's and Amy's relationship move forward and I'm really tired of the Leonard/Penny thing. I hope they shake it up a little more next season."
B009IF7092 My husband and I love The Big Band Theory. It is funny and very entertaining. This set is perfect because you get Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy."
B009IF7092 One of my favorite shows.  Sheldon is such a mess and poor Leonard just needs someone to appreciate him.  The writing and characters are so well done"
B009IF7092 so funny!! i love this show it is so in tune with realities of life and the humor is very well written"
B009IF7092 I cut the cord & got rid of cable this year, but I had to still get my fix. Buying the season pass on amazon was the way to go. This season was good, & can't wait for the next one! (which I will be streaming from Amazon again :) ) My chemical engineer nerd husband likes it too !"
B009IF7092 Amy and Sheldon steal it on the bad girl couch. so worth buying. if you bought 1-5, get 6. so worth it."
B009IF7092 This is a great show!  The characters are just hilarious. We just laugh at all the funny quirks and sci-fi referrences.  It's so funny!!"
B009IF7092 I love this show!! lots of changes and scares in this season, but if your an addict like me then this is no reason to stop now!!"
B009IF7092 Another great series especially when you need a laugh after a hard day a work put on big bang and your laughing alot.  I am so happy this is here so I can put it in and enjoy the fun and laughter...."
B009IF7092 This series has continued to make me laugh out loud. The actors are excellent and stay true to character. It is just a delightful series. I highly recommend this series to anyone."
B009IF7092 One of the best seasons to date by far. The whole family watches it, and we all love it!And there's no bazinga on the end of that."
B009IF7092 I have been a big fan from the beginning.  Like the characters who have grown and changed from season to season while still remaining &#34;who they are&#34;.  The humor is fun and not mean.I find myself laughing with the characters and the situation they get themselves into and not at them or someone else."
B009IF7092 Well I love this nerdy show. I love that the girls try to get smart to under stand the boys who are super smart but act like 5 yr olds by liking super heros comic books etc."
B009IF7092 This is my favorite comedy on television.  I own all 6 seasons and each time I watch an episode I pick up something I missed from the original airing.  Great cast, great writing equals a great TV show."
B009IF7092 The whole Howard in Space thread ise a very funny one, with Howard finding himself in the astronautic equivalent of High School, being picked on by NASA astronaut Mike Massasmino, who does a wonderful job of creating a character here. Meanwhile Penny is conflicted, Leonard is clueless, and the Amy and Sheldon relationship continues to develop in its own strange way. Plenty of laugh out loud moments."
B009IF7092 While there was always a little sexual undertone with the tension between Penny and the others, this season has become a non-stop barrage of sexual innuendo and jokes.  It is unnecessary."
B009IF7092 I love this show. It never seems to get old. The only problem with this show is that there isn't enough time in 20ish minutes to highlight each of the characters in a given arc. Such is life though I will go on.I have noticed with this last season that the humor is being based more and more on whats going on in previous episodes. It works well if you are a diehard fan like me but trying to watch it with friends for the first time can involve some explanation. As an example when Sheldon goes to Will Wheaton's house to confront him about Amy in the first episode, Sheldon forgets which knock he is on, because he is drunk. Its a really clever sequence but if you hadn't watched the previous seasons it doesn't make any sense that he forgets what knock he is on.No worries for me though I plan to keep on watching."
B009IF7092 Pretty standard sitcom.. makes me laugh ocassionally.  I think they could make it funnier, for sure.  But I enjoy this sho
B009IF7092 As long time viewer of TBBT, it has been fear that over the years the show would become stale like many shows that last as long as this show has now in its 6th season.  But this show is still as creative as it was on day one.  Can't wait for the next episode!"
B009IF7092 Enjoy the series"
B009IF7092 I LOVE this show.  There are very few shows on TV today that I like.  The writers for this show are brilliant, and so is the ensemble cast, especially Jim Parsons as Sheldon. Since I'm not always home on the night the show airs I hadn't seen much of the 6th or 7th season. I now own the first 6 seasons."
B009IF7092 Great comedy just love it. Been a long time since I enjoyed Tv usually watch movies"
B009IF7092 the second half of this season especially shows how the show runners have put charliesheens drama behind them and put creativity on the front burner again..they aren't trying to win new fans with this season, just reward the existing ones with favorite story lines and inside jokes."
B009IF7092 One of the best shows on tv for sure. I could watch every episode over and over and still crack up laughing."
B009IF7092 Got this to help my husband keep his BBT collection growing. We both really enjoy the show and its even better without commercials."
B009IF7092 The wife and I love Big Bang Theory, it's a funny show. We're techie kind of folks and can relate to a lot of the 'fish out of water' situations they get themselves into."
B009IF7092 This is my favorite comedy on TV. I love everything about it. These guys are hilarious and very like able."
B009IF7092 I have watched the Big Bang Theory since it first started.  Time after time I have watched the season re-runs.  Just as funny!  There is nothing on TV like this show and it is at least kind of clean, for todays standards!"
B009IF7092 I really like this show. I have The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-5 on DVD. I laugh really hard everytime I watch. I got into this series sometime after it started becoming popular. My mom and I are huge fans of this series."
B009IF7092 I LOVED the first two seasons of TBBT. Season three was OK. Season four started great and then took a really bad turn when they turned Amy into a Penny worshiping sex crazed groupie. They also dumbed down the show a lot after that. They've destroyed Leonards character with the Penny relationship. He should be with someone smart like Alex,or Priya, not a dumb bimbo blonde with way too much attitude who believes in psychics and gets mad when he points out to her that all psychics are frauds. Season six was better than season five but the show has lost it's direction. I like the additions of Bernadette and Amy, I just wish they were allowed to be the smart women they are supposed to be. Raj's character has also taken a turn for the worse. They feminized him and made him way too pathetic. The only character they have developed well is Howard. Bring the science back and fix the theme song, the Big Bang did not happen fourteen million years ago it was fourteen billion years ago."
B009IF7092 Still going strong, and a great counter to too many reality shows corrupting tv.  This show is just as good as Friends."
B009IF7092 This is our current comedy favorite. The show moves along at a brisk clip. It has boldly added new cast members and has great guest stars. Hope they continue for many more seasons."
B009IF7092 This show is great, love watching it on Amazon Instant Video. Will buy more videos and music using this service."
B009IF7092 The characters keep growing (many times despite themselves), yet the core of this series is still fun and laughs. The earlier seasons are on TV everywhere and it doesn't matter if I've seen an episode, once or many times, I can still catch a portion and enjoy some laughs. I hope they continue forever as long as they can maintain this quality."
B009IF7092 I love this show. It is one of the best shows out there in my opinion. It is like the new &#34;Friends&#34;"
B009IF7092 People kept telling us to watch this show, but we kept putting it off.  After watching a couple of shows, we had to get all the episodes from previous seasons.  I watch them over and over and laugh over and over"
B009IF7092 I love this show, but I think Season 6 had more misses than hits. The fact that Amy and Sheldon's relationship is still going nowhere seems &#34;illogical&#34; at this point - and the girl they paired Raj up with is an unmitigated disaster that makes my skin crawl and is so boring it makes Sheldon's &#34;fun with flags&#34; look like something you want to spend all day watching. I really wish they had tried harder to find a recurring role/place for Sara Gilbert, whose pithy snarkasm was well-suited to the show. Personally, I also didn't enjoy the often weird sexual innuendos that felt like pandering to the lowest form of &#34;entertainment&#34;.Since the show has been renewed for another 3 seasons, I really hope that this isn't a sign of deterioration that's only going to get worse - it would be a shame to see this comedic gem flail and ultimately make you wish they'd quit while they were ahead..."
B009IF7092 Is it just me or has this show gotten funnier this season, especially jim parson's character sheldon, and then with the last vic's vapor rub episode the question intensifies will sheldon ever get him some this season, and if he does how will he react to it? This show is as funny as it has ever been, i love it."
B009IF7092 I look forward to watching the big bang theory when ever it's on. I can even handle a rerun if I haven't seen it more than about 5 times. Raj, is a grate character, and I'm constantly amazed at the &#34;in character&#34; (as well as creative and consistent) wardrobe selections made for Howard, and Sheldon.Some times Penny's character kind of wears me out. I find her and Lenard's on a gain off again attraction getting kind of hackneyed.With all this said, I'll still have to say that this is one of my favorite shows and I look forward to watching it every time it comes on."
B009IF7092 Best season yet"
B009IF7092 Even though episodes of The Big Bang Theory seem to be airing nearly every day on my local TV stations (sometimes two at a time) in addition to new episodes on CBS, I find that this is a series made for \"binge watching\" via the DVD sets.  One reason is that each episode takes 30 minutes to watch on TV but, once the commercials are removed, each filmed episode lasts just 20 minutes. So you can enjoy the series in 1/3 less time. The other reason is that these shows are like potato chips: you can't eat (well watch in the case of TBBT) just one. And in less than three evenings you can devour this 24 episode set.  Personally, I think that watching certain ones together make the story lines flow better.If you are one of the few who found this review but have not seen the show before, know that, while it always pays to go back to the beginning, you can start most anywhere though you won't understand Howard's time as an astronaut or how Sheldon got a \"girlfriend\".The show definitely has a cult audience among \"celebrities\" and in Season 6 we get appearances by astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Mike Massimino as well as lots of mentions of Stephen Hawking and - the funniest episode for me - Bob Newart as a former kids' science  TV show host.  As with other volumes, there are a bunch of interesting Special features.  There is a panel with the cast at the 2013 Paley Fest in LA, two fun pieces dealing with the astronauts, the now-requisite \"deleted scenes\" and \"gag reel\" and a 30 minute featurette with each of the cast's \"couples\" on how their relationships are handled (I won't give you details because there are some \"spoilers there.)I came to the series later than many and used the DVD sets to \"get up to speed\". And with this 6th season I'm there; ready to see where plot lines take us.This is one of the smartest TV series in years and has a wide appeal to everyone.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B009IF7092 This is the best comedy on television. No matter how dark my mood, one episode of BBT will usually get me to laugh. Several times!"
B009IF7092 This is the first comedy I have seen in a long time that does really make me laugh when I'm watching it. And I mean, my sides hurt I laugh so much sometimes. I love all of the quirky characters, the stories range from silly to touching, and all of the actors perform seamlessly. If you're feeling blue or cranky, give this show a try - it should cheer you right up!"
B009IF7092 This is a family favorite series. The 6th season did not disappoint. It is still as funny and witty as ever."
B009IF7092 We had never seen it, we've been watching them back to back a few each night for weeks...almost to current season. This show is so cute and funny. I don't know how we missed it all these years!"
B009IF7092 I was losing interest in this show last season for the direction it was going, but it seems to be improving as this season continues. Im glad I stuck around."
B009IF7092 I purchased this as a gift for my son for Christmas, these shows can make anyones holiday delightful. Sheldon  is extremely intelligent, but can't relate to other people or their emotions.Leonard is a hopeless romantic, and a complete nerd. Howard, lovable, yet has a mother complex problem.Raj is east indian , can't get a girlfriend, and can not talk to women unless he is drinking.GREAT SHOW, WORTH EVERY PENNY."
B009IF7092 While a few episodes sag (&#34;The Extract Obliteration&#34;, &#34;The Tangible Affection Proof&#34;, &#34;The Bon Voyage Reaction&#34;) most episodes continue to delight and tickle the tummy with storylines that run through several episodes.  Who woulda thought that Wolowitz would really end up in space?  As awkwardly funny as that seems on paper the presentation of his slowly losing his sanity while being the butt of practical jokes by the other astronauts are some showstopping LOL moments (oh that drawn on mouse face!).  Sheldon and Amy's relationship advances in devious ways (hurt much?).  Leonard gets hit on by Sheldon's attractive assistant.  But t
B009IF7092 Had watched season 6 on tv. This show is still as fresh as first season. Lot of shows crash after a few seasons. It is still fresh. Great gift idea too."
B009IF7092 While I have been saying that one of the best additions to this show were the women, since season four the show has been a bit stagnant. The sixth season has finally started to slowly move the story along as we see Sheldon and Amy take their relationship further, Howard and Bernadette experience marriage, Penny & Leonard reaching a major crossroad and yes even Raj will discover something about himself that he never knew he had.I never would have imagined that a show about nerdy guys were become the phenomenon that it is today and I am very excited to see where this show will go in season seven."
B009IF7092 I love this show, and this season was one of the best so far. I was extremely satisfied and can't wait for the next season."
B009IF7092 My wife was happy to recieve the fulll season and now has all of the shows available. It is clear with great sound. Each DVD is nicely placed in each case. Delivered quickly package nicely."
B009IF7092 bbt - it is fun.  the only thing not to like is the end.  how to say it is fun in twenty non-repeating words, therein lies the challenge.  why can't we get a word count, so we know how many to add?"
B009IF7Z38 Grey's anatomy is a well known &#34;medical drama&#34; having made it to its 9th season at this point. That said, the only updates it seems to have received in the last 8 years are that it has moved further from &#34;medical&#34; and far more into plain &#34;drama.&#34;Grey's has moved further and further away from the actual medicine. These days almost every episode is about the drama of the main characters themselves and their personal lives. While that has always been a theme, it always took place within the greater backdrop of the hospital. By the time we hit Season 9, the setting of the show almost doesn't matter. These could be workers at a Starbucks and the basics of the show would be the same.The problem here is that so much drama has happened to these characters at this point that it is hard to feel any connection to them anymore. There's hardly a doctor among them who hasn't been stabbed, shot, died, brought back to life, married, divorced, remarried, re-divorced, sued, pregnant, leaving, returning, etc. There's only so much that can happen to one character before you just become disconnected from the whole thing.If you're a fan of the series, this season  is probably worth watching. If you're iffy on the whole theme to begin with, it might be time to just say enough is enough and find something fresh."
B009IF7Z38 I've watched ER through 10 years, House for its duration and Grey's Anatomy for 7 years. I really enjoy medical shows. But even I know when its time to give up the ghost. Grey's has reached its end time. Would hope they don't let it drag on like ER. Story lines are getting too similar."
B009IF7Z38 I rarely stick with a series for 9 seasons because the story lines usually becomes weak, predictable or boring at some point and the characters become stale,  but Grey's Anatomy is still going strong with characters and plots that continue to appeal to me."
B009IF7Z38 So far it explains what happened as a result if the crash and shows where and why folks remain at Seattle Grace with some authenticity. It also shows that characters are dealing with new issues and have new status which is valid. And always dealing with emergency and mystery and (painful) humor. And leaves us wondering what is next and how folks will cope!"
B009IF7Z38 I cant wait for season 10 though I fear the show is nearing the end. It is a great show I just see aspects of it that will lead to the death of the series."
B009IF7Z38 The writers had a couple episodes where they must have been on brain vacation but the new twists and turns they are putting in are really great.  I wish they had an episode EVERY week!"
B009IF7Z38 my wife enjoys it.  some seasons are better than others.  this one seems to emphasize more on how good looking the female stars are, vs shows in the past mostly showed them in scrubs."
B009IF7Z38 One of the best medical shows ever put on TV!  They always have something new every season, they don't just keep repeating the same stuff.  The actors can really act!  I'm just in love with the show!!!"
B009IF7Z38 I really liked watching the interactions between doctors, the story lines.  Sure there may be too much sexual activity going on, but then who knows if that stuff happens in real life...or maybe that's what is going through their minds that they don't act out."
B009IF7Z38 What drew me to Grey's initially was the portrayal of smart women in a difficult profession. After years of seeing the portrayal of professional women trying to act like men, it was refreshing to see women be women and still have working brains. Women do have different ways of looking at problems, situations than men do, which isn't a bad thing; I feel at times the show portrayed that well. As a more conservative viewer, I don't care for the flippancy where sex is concerned. I believe the hopping around from one partner to another has its consequences, which is not dealt with on the show and sends the wrong message. And, yes, I know it's a TV show, not real life. However, there are younger viewers that will still want to emulate this behavior. Over the seasons there has been way too many near death experiences for Meredith, and a tendency to overdo certain story lines, i.e. on again, off again relationships - Owen/Christine, Jackson/April, etc. Not sure where the show will go next season and not sure I will continue to watch."
B009IF7Z38 I have been watching this show since the beginning, and it is amazing!  My favorite show ever with actual real life scenarios."
B009IF7Z38 Love this show my daughter got me addicted to it.  It is kinda a soap opera but with way more real life action."
B009IF7Z38 You can't take Grey's Anatomy seriously and just have to flow with it, Derek/Meredith should not look so good for two people who have drowned, been shot then crashed in a plane!If you put all that aside the positives are emotional impact that somehow always reaches me on patient-survival-death-love stories, also the fact that they positively represent gay characters to the point now that we do believe their relationships and/or ignore or get bored with them like any other characters on the show."
B009IF7Z38 This episode shows both together and apart, the bond of friendship across many miles and differing circumstances.  It cements Christina and Meredith through extraordinary and everyday events in their lives.  It is difficult to make a split screen then full scene work well between story lines but this \"Grey's Anatomy\" does that very well.  Those who are observant and attentive will see both psychological and experiential events unfold about the previous pivotal plane crash episode.  If you need it spelled out, you are not engaging deeply enough in this fine example of television drama unfolding at its best."
B009IF7Z38 Grey's Anatomy still manages to keep the story unexpected and entertaining. I enjoy all episodes!  And am looking forward to this season as well."
B009IF7Z38 This season isn't even half way through yet! I am enjoying it though! The stories and the characters are strong this season, except for the **SPOILERS** April & Avery  storyline."
B009IF7Z38 I love the characters and relationships on Grey's Anatomy.  Over time, each character changed and evolved, making me care about them as I would  if I really knew them."
B009IF7Z38 I have never watched Grey's Anatomy at it's regular time on Network.  I started watching it from Season 1 on Amazon Instant Video; it totally caputured my attention; I love the show and am glad that it's returning for a 10th Season."
B009IF7Z38 I was re-addicted to GA in Season 9,  each episode was riviting and totally entertaining.  The Finale was awesome enough for me to purchase it from Amazon.  Looking forward to GA's return."
B009IF7Z38 I've watched all seasons.  While this season is not as good seasons past, I refuse to give up on it!  I still miss George!"
B009IF7Z38 i love this show, and i've been watching it from the beginging.  This was a hard season to watch with the deaths of two of my favorite characters, but i still love the show and will continue to watch."
B009IF7Z38 yeah okay so maybe they will eventually tell us what happened out in the woods after the plane crash, but they are taking too long, and in the meantime, the stories are boring and non-existent.  I suppose it's to keep us watching, but it's disappointing.  How did they stay warm, given the fact that they used their last match?  and how did they get food?  What about the pilot- he couldn't have stayed strapped in his seat for a week!  and how did they keep Arizona's leg from bleeding out?  Cristina mentioned once that animals were coming for Lexie, but how did they keep the animals away from her?  I've loved this show from the beginning, but this season is one HUGE letdown so far.  At the very least, they should give us interesting story lines if nothing else.  I'm guessing it's going to end very badly, like too many good TV shows do.I can't stand how they just keep showing us tiny snippets of the crash without any explanations."
B009IF7Z38 It was getting iffy there for a while. I had actually quit watching it after the 6th season. I caught some 7th/8th season episodes here and there, enough to know what was going on in the 9th but the 9th definitely pulled me back in. If you're an Arizona fan, you'll get plenty of her. I also love the April and Jackson storyline. Meredith and Derek have new things going on. Cristina is still hilarious. I say give this season a shot."
B009IF7Z38 I've always been a huge Greys fan! I love that even if I miss a week amazon allows me to purchase episode by episode instead of waiting months for the entire season to come out on DVD!"
B009IF7Z38 Grey's Anatomy is my absolute favorite show on television now...I own all the past seasons on my Kindle and have watched them over again."
B009IF7Z38 Losing key characters has been a real heartbreaker for us diehard GA fans. Although the show has turned somewhat darker, the acting and character interaction is as mesmerizing as ever. I don't know how much longer the show will continue, but I will continue to watch with all the sadness and joy this wonderful show always brings."
B009IF7Z38 I love the drama that medicine can serve. In every show it shows me that their are good days and bad days in a life of doctor's and nurses. But in the end it all about the patient's"
B009IF7Z38 My wife and I consider the all seasons of this show a flawless masterpiece. The acting, character, and plot development are exquisite."
B009IG59DK Shonda Rhimes writes like nobody else can or ever has on a tv show you never know where the next episode is going because it always goes where you didn't expect."
B009IG59DK I enjoy watching this program about a woman, Olivia Pope, after successfully helping get her choice in candidates win the Presidency (and engages in an extra martial affair with him) leaves the White House and strikes out on her as a &#34;fixer&#34;. Pope's affair isn't an new idea but her decision to become a &#34;fixer&#34; of the problems of her elite clients is a different career choice for the &#34;other&#34; woman.  It is fun to watch Pope solve the unsolvable but it is unbelievable. It would be nice if the justice was always served and the good guys wins in the end, but it is TV not the real world."
B009IG59DK I enjoyed the political drama and the great ensemble cast.  The writing is typical to Shonda Rhimes : fast paced and interesting withlots of twists and turns.  Some good acting from all cast members especially &#34;Huck&#34; who suffers from PTSD.  The surprise at the ending was an extra and obviously an opening for season three of the series."
B009IG59DK This Season's Scandal is nail- biting, on the edge of your seat, entertainment!  I is a classic example of the saying,&#34;oh, what a wicked web we weave ....&#34; and the web is starting to unravel as well as trasp others within it.  Great T.V.!"
B009IG59DK I got turned on to this show by my co-workers and it is a great show. However, I find myself disliking most of the main characters. They are supposedly good guys, but will sink to the lowest levels to save themselves. The show is well written and very suspenseful, but most of the characters' behavior and actions just turns me off. In this series, no one really wears the white hat."
B009IG59DK This show did a 180 from season 1. Lots more scandal and drama it went from a intresting show to edge of your seat in season 2. I honestly cant wait to see more."
B009IG59DK This show is soooo darn good. I had to add it to my series to keep collection. Hope it has More seasons to come"
B009IG59DK I HAVE LOST COUNT OF THE TIMES I HAVE REWATCHED THE ENTIRE SERIES AND DISCOVERED SUBTLE DETAILS.  THE WRITING IS FANTASTIC, THE SMALLEST ACTION  BECOMES SIGNIFICANT IN SUBSEQUENT EPISODES.  REMINDS ME OF HITCHCOCK.THE CAST IS EXCELLENT AND VERY BELIEVABLE.  THE WARDROBE IS AMAZING, PARTICULARLY FOR OLIVIA AND MELLIE.  I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SEASON THREE TO START."
B009IG59DK This is a fantastic show. Exciting and dramatic. The Fitz and Olivia have amazing chemistry. The secrets revealed about each character are amazing and the intrigue is wonderful. Definitely one of my favorite shows. I hope it continues for several more seasons."
B009IG59DK Shonda Rhimes, the creator of Scandal has created a strong and gripping show. The characters are never what you think even the most boring ones offer surprises in character twists.Best of all is Olivia Pope portrayed by the talented Kerry Washington. Olivia has layers! Her facial expressions alone are worth viewing.If you miss Scandal on TV it is worth purchasing it from Amazon some times you catch things you missed before."
B009IG59DK I love this show!  Not a lot of sex, not a lot of sexual manipulations, not about disrespecting loud mouth children having temper tantrum over their multimillion dollar trust funds, just plain ordinary schemes and plots being &#34;fixed&#34; to maintain some level of law and order.  It's great to have a show about adults and NOT CHILDREN!!!"
B009IG59DK This is a real fast pace exciting, Oh Wow Drama, I cant believe it. I was not real excited about it at first. it moves really fast and sometimes I had to rewind to figure out what the heck was being said. I'd be like &#34;WHAT?&#34; but I am additcted. I just love it. it is wild and make you wonder..... really wonder...."
B009IG59DK Well, the acting is great and the characters are very interesting but it's one of those shows where the longer I watched it the more I felt as if I were doing something I shouldn't. I realize there is adultery and there are dirty politics but it just isn't something I want to fill my brain with and call it entertainment."
B009IG59DK I am addicted to this series, and am caught up now.  This is a great way to catch up, and if the commercials keep on taking more and more regular TV time, I may switch to watching it all this way.  Its a but pricey at $1.99 per episode, but......"
B009IG59DK SO. SO. GOOD. Let me say it again, in case you didn't quite get it. SO. GOOD.This series moves at a pace that most shows couldn't sustain. It's incredible - I would love to spend a week or even day in this writer&#8217;s room. There are so many twists - even within one episode. You think you know something, but really you don't. When some shows try to do twist like this, they can come out of left field... there's no cohesion to what just happened. Scandal, on the other hand, it so well put together. You can go back and see where they started developing something episodes ago. The characters have their own complex web of story lines. The thing about Scandal though, you MUST watch it in order!!! It just ruins the experience otherwise. Start at season 1 &#8211; it is WELL-WORTH the money. Season 1 is short too so you&#8217;ll be caught up in no time&#8230;.especially because you won&#8217;t be able to leave your TV when this show is on."
B009IG59DK I did not miss the complete Season 2 I only purchased one episode; I never miss Scandal but due to a Major Strom or Breaking News I was unable to record one of my favorite series . Thank God for instant video!"
B009IG59DK Does Shonda Rhimes take genius pills every night??? WTF?!?! This show doesn't stop and delivers EVERY EPISODE! Thanks for such a great show! I'm a scoundrel for Scandal"
B009IG59DK The characters in this show are dynamic! The video is outstanding! The story lines have you sitting on the edge of your seat! The relationship between Ms. Pope and the President is mesmerizing! If you enjoy suspense, you will not be disappointed if you buy it!"
B009IG59DK Absolutely love this show. Incredible actors, suspenseful drama, intelligent discourse and great moments of off brand humor.  Highly recommend this show to anyone."
B009IG59DK I love to watch this show. I get it on my Kindle and watch it. I love the plots and the chatacters. This is a show that is well put together with suberb story lines."
B009IG59DK I really wish they'd all stop talking in the same way, like everything's an emergency and they memorized all they're going to say (which they did, of course). Sometimes it gets better, sometimes slides back, but worth watching to decide for yourself."
B009IG59DK Let me start off by saying I was so addicted to season one that I watched each episode over an over until the next new one came out then I repeated the cycle. This season not so much. What made this show so great was the fact that Olivia and her team where gladiators! They always got their man. I liked not knowing exactly how they accomplished the mission when it was really sticky because in my imagination I could always come up with my own ideas. Now, they are being down right mean and deceitful to each other and it really doesn't seem like a team of gladiators any more, just a team of crooks, liars, and thugs! If this was really how the white house was won in the past, present, or future, I would be really scared and appalled! All I know is if they don't get it together, I'm going to have to stop watching this show! One good thing is I will always have season one to enjoy over an over again! Oh yeah, I don't care who shot Fritz because with the political divide in this country, I think the writers where irresponsible to include an episode of how to assassinate a president! They know real life people like to imitate TV fiction and they should be ashamed of themselves! I am not happy! Not happy at all with this season of scandal!"
B009IG59DK This is great. Appears to follow the white house real good. I would recommend for all adults to watch over the age of 18."
B009IG59DK I write very few reviews but oh my goodness, Scandal is the best show on TV.  I can't wait for next season."
B009IG59DK great cast, great story line. love the drama, the exciting twists and turns. I can not wait for season 3"
B009IG59DK Scandal is addictive.  I'm not sure if I enjoy the plots or the ensemble having so much fun with those same plots.  This is a rare case where the ensemble is everything.  The series is so well cast, that you are intrigued with them and can't wait to find out what else is in store for them.The plots are well crafted, and by far one of the best television series on the air."
B009IG59DK The best of the best...I am an addicted lover of the series.  Everyone is cast perfectly...Kerry Washington is fabulous and Tony Goldwyn is so great with his deep and serious voice...the timbre of it..ooohhh, and his chest is the best...Shonda Rhimes is a genius and the entire cast and show will win every award that they are offered...and &#34;Cyrus&#34; is a wonderful and intense character...he tells it like he sees it...devious, oh, yes, but that is part of the appeal.The way the last segment of the show was perfect.!!!!..when, &#34;Olivia&#34; says, &#34;DAD?&#34;...The white hat that David Rosen gave to Olivia was a great symbol of his real respect and friendship because they always teased one another as to who was wearing the &#34;white hat&#34;...I loved Cyrus telling Olivia that life is not a romance novel and what she and the President have for one another is not a romance novel, and then he, of course tells Olivia about Verna and the President...put your fingers too close the &#34;cage&#34; and he will bite them off, great analogy !!!Great writing, great creativity, great casting and to think that the entire show is based on Judy Smith a real person that handled the drama surrounding Washington D.C....of course, Ms. Rhimes used it only as a baseline for the show and Judy Smith is a real person, she did not do what the characters in the show do....she was a &#34;crisis manager&#34; and that gives the show a great deal of credibility.Needless to say, I AM HOOKED!!!!Mary Ann aka Mia"
B009IG59DK I. LOVE. THIS. SHOW. If you're not watching this show you are missing out! I will be rewatching this & season 1 before season 3 begins to ease my withdrawal symptoms!"
B009IG59DK I love scandal and when I miss this expose so I was able to order it on the amazon, Love it"
B009IG59DK Great cast, great stories.  Even though it just a TV show, you just KNOW this is what goes on in Washington everyday."
B009IG59DK The acting is very good and it shows kinda what a president is caught up in.  It gives you an idea about political messes and how crooked gov. appears.  It has romance and it has tragedy/  The manipulation that seems to go on in politics is very interesting."
B009IG59DK I really enjoy this show because of the unusual characters and I like that they wear white hats while being faced with difficult moral choices all of the time.  Interesting show...and those kind of things probably really go on in our political arena."
B009IG59DK I love Scandal, it is my guilty pleasure, but one that I never feel bad about because it is that good and it comes to life in this instant amazon video."
B009IG59DK One of the best shows on TV. Can't wait for the new season. You never know what crazy &#34;Scandal&#34; will pop up next."
B009IG59DK I really enjoyed season one.  So far season two hasn't been too bad.  I love Kerri Washington.  Hope they can keep the stories interesting."
B009IG59DK It's Hollywood, It's T.V. It's not real life. I would think that there's not much more to say other than, well constructed, good staffing and good entertainment. If there's a book....read it!"
B009IG59DK I never watched this on television but you better believe I will for Season 3.  Just enough intrigue to keep you interested but not confused."
B009IG59DK A friend got me hooked on this show. I don't know where they're going with it, but I'm definitely in."
B009IG59DK This story had more twists and turns (I loved them all)  and they almost went to far, but we never fell off the ledge.  I can hardly wait to see what is going to happen next.  Super entertaining, you will get caught up in some of the moments, and you will become attached to many of the characters, not just the leads."
B009IG59DK Can't stop watching this show.  Show has excellent writing and acting. Show's political subject is very unique. Caution: This show is extremely addictive."
B009IG59DK Amazing, adventurous, sexy, exciting, intriguing, passionate, intelligent, all in one! This series is what I've been waiting for, something I can dig my mind into. Still watching Season 1 & 2...can't wait for the new season!"
B009IG59DK I started watching because nothing else was on the television.  I quickly bought the entire season one and couldnt wait for season 2.  EXCELLENT!  Romance, intrigue, drama, and suspense - it has it all!"
B009IG59DK I've been watching this season 2 at work during my lunch and everyone laughs because I yelling at the computer.  So far this season is AMAZING"
B009IG59DK I never realized how easy it was to order movies or tv episodes off of Amazon to download directly to my Amazon site.  I will not hesitate to do it again."
B009IG59DK \"Scandal Season 2\" continues with the intriguing and entertaining lives of Fitz, Mellie, Olivia Pope, Cyrus, and the other men and women strongly intertwined with their lives. I really enjoyed the emergence of the various love stories that were weaved into these characters lives.  It was also both heartwarming but also heart string pulling to see the character of Huck reacting when exposed to the dynamic of family and love.  Abby Whelan is also greatly transformed when the concept of love comes into her life. It was entertaining to see her get into an ultra- protective mode when someone she cares about gets into danger.  Please know that I feel that many of the characters contributed to Season 2 in one fantastic way or another. Additionally, the profiles of Huck and Abby Whelan are still two of my favorite characters from Scandal. However, I have to admit that I also enjoyed the psychological growth of Harrison Wright and Hollis Doyle. The character of Harrison Wright shows a man who is willing to do what it takes to protect the strength of the Pope & Associates firm while conscientiously minimizing the potential harm that could be done.  Wright is also brilliantly depicted showing concern and loyalty to his fellow co-workers, especially Olivia Pope and Abby Whelan. George Newbern gives an enigmatic performance as the character of Charlie. The character of Hollis Doyle is also superbly shown in Season 2 to be a man who has a heart. He is initially shown naturally being skeptical about what happens to one of his daughters but still caring about her well-being.  A more multi-dimensional side of him emerges when he makes a tough love decision on what to do with his daughter because he is also concerned about one of his ex-wives.  Scandal Season 2 is great for those who already enjoyed Scandal Season 1 and/or like political thrillers set in the Washington D.C. area."
B009IG59DK Whoa, did not see that coming, no wonder his wife did not want to go to the gala..Shondra Rhimes if fricken brilliant."
B009IG59DK Scandal is well-written, fast-paced and well-acted. Topical subjects, great chemistry among actors - a cut above the typical Hollywood produced TV series. it will be along summer waiting for the series to return after those terrific cliff-hangers in the last episode!"
B009IG59DK The show has everything you need politics, love, and suspense all wrapped up in a precious bow! A must watch."
B009IG59DK Great show, i turned on to this and i love it, well worth my time and money, must watch everyone"
B009IG59DK Absolutely love, love, love this show.  I hope they continue with this series for a long time to come.  Very pleased with purchase.A++++"
B009IG59DK I absolutely love this show.  It is a credit to television.  Can't wait until Thursday nights to watch.  Everyone I know is into thsi show."
B009IG59DK Who told you to come up with the best scandal. This show is great I love to see whats going to happen next. All the secrets, lies, cheating makes the show so interesting to watch. Thanks for the show."
B009IG59DK Another suspenseful season! Good show! keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering how true it really is about what goes on in DC"
B009IG59DK I am a SCANDAL addict. There. I've said it. This is such an exciting & extraordinarily well written, directed and written show!!! I do not have a TV. Everything I do is over the 'net. Bought Season's 1&2 to catch up. Will buy Season 3. Happily hooked!"
B009IJJ5B4 I watch most TV shows on Hulu but since CBS doesn't use Hulu, I decided to try an episode or two (which turned into an entire season pass) of Elementary. I loved reading Sherlock Holmes and love all things Sherlock Holmes (except for the second Robert Downey, Jr. film?). I love Lucy Liu as Watson. Really refreshing take. Jonny Lee Miller brings a great manic energy to the role. It's an interesting take on a procedural show, which everyone notes was probably taken from Sherlock Holmes stories in the first place."
B009IJJ5B4 I started watching this show from the beginning and loved it!  Jonny Lee Miller is great at being a lovable a_ _ and Lucy Liu is brilliant as Watson.  I was an AA Sponsor for years and they stay true enough to that part of life that it gets the message across The entire cast is great, the stories are both intriguing and funny as they solve cases in their own unique way.  Highly recommended!"
B009IJJ5B4 I give this show four stars because it really was a consistently good show up until the season finale. I grew up with the &#34;real&#34; Holmes, as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so I tend to take a dim view on anyone &#34;re-imagining&#34; the character.Still, I have to admit that &#34;Elementary&#34; does a good job of answering the question, &#34;What would Sherlock be like if he had been born in the late 21st century rather than the Victorian era?&#34;. I was also dubious about making Watson into a woman, as I feared it would disrupt the dynamic between the two characters or worse yet, involve them romantically, which would be way too cliched and &#34;Hollywood&#34;. So far though, the relationship works well, primarily due to the excellent cast.My only complaint is their handling of Moriarity and also that of Irene Adler. Without giving away any of the plot, I have to say I was extremely disappointed with how they handled two of the more important characters in the Canon, and also the brevity of their stories. That being said, their Moriarity is still a huge improvement over the terrible BBC version,Take this review with a grain of salt. I literally grew up with Sherlock Holmes, and I still read all the stories about once a year. It's natural that my review will be much harsher than those who are less invested. &#34;Elementary&#34;, taken on its own merits, is an excellent mystery series with stellar acting, good writing, and some clever ideas."
B009IJJ5B4 I have been and remain a fan of the Holmes/Watson sagas for decades now. This entry in the lore is an excellent twist on The Woman and Moriarity being the most important people, other than Watson, in the life of Sherlock Holmes.I have watched this entire season with great enjoyment and look forward to more in Season 2. I am really quite intrigued on how we are going to be shown the Reichenbach Falls  in this interpretation of a modern day Holmes.I wasn't quite enamored of Lucy as Dr. Watson until the final 4-5 episodes starting with the one where her friends question her decisions and she commits to the new job/life and ending with her planning and implementing the plan to catch Moriarity.SPOILERS***********Natalie Dormer plays The Woman Irene Adler and the Mastermind to perfection. I hope we see more of her.Watch the show and decide for yourself."
B009IJJ5B4 Basic Idea, Sherlock Holmes redone for our times.Watson has a sex changeHolmes is just getting out of rehab.And they all moved to New York, where Aiden Quinn serves as some high placed police detective or what not.Gone is Mycroft, instead there's Sherlock's father who is never seen, nor heard from, only emails to Watson that we never get to see.  (Plot mistake in my mind)To give it credit it gives a nod to the Sherlock of old, but the plots aren't the same derivative mutations of classic plots that I've seen in the past (granted it's been a good 40 years since I read the original stories, many of my little gray cells have died since then (apologies to Agatha Christie).)Still plots are intelligent, the puzzle of the murders are decent and they don't cheat overly.  If you pay attention you have a good chance of following along.Character interaction, which is something that I really prize in a series gets off to a shaky start, but has progressed and gotten considerably more solid as episodes have progressed.It's taking it awhile to evolve, but I think there's a lot of potential if they keep taking it in the same direction and as of right now, episodes are quite enjoyable.Not as good as Sherlock (BBC Series) yet, but there's a lot more of it to enjoy.And from what I'm reading, there may only be a third season with 2-3 episodes if you're lucky and an end to that whole thing.Bottom line, up and coming, recommended"
B009IJJ5B4 Solid cast, great writing - all in all a very smart show that I genuinely look forward to watching each week!"
B009IJJ5B4 I've enjoyed the first episode and although I will say I like the BBC version better this isn't bad for a knock off.  The chemistry between the characters will hopefully develop in time and the quirks are good."
B009IJJ5B4 What a great adaptation of a classic character and his introduction into the modern world. The rapport between the two stars is fantastic. The cases are clever as only Holmes' should be and the 2nd series should be just as good"
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is the latest TV adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes characters. But unlike BBC's Sherlock (an excellent show also starring the sleuth), Elementary, character names aside, bears absolutely NO resemblance to the original stories.Sherlock Holmes is now a tattooed, recovering heroin addict living in New York.John Watson is now Jane Watson, a female doctor helping Holmes get off his drug addiction.Tobias Gregson is now a New Yoyka detective.And I'm not even going to tell you how they butchered and defiled the characters of Irene Adler and Moriarty in the name of originality.The plots bear no resemblance to Conan Doyle's writings, which allows the Elementary to go into complete original territories. And sometimes they go too far, which alienates hardcore Sherlock Holmes fans like me.But wait - you're getting the impression that this is a bad show! Well, it isn't. The cast is damn fine, especially Johnny Lee Miller as the impossible detective, who turns in an impressive and, at times, emotional performance. Lucy Liu pulls her weight, and Adrian Quinn is typically good. I have reservations about Natalie Dormer, but she is a solid actress who has played some fine roles recently. I am waiting on Season 2 eagerly to see more.The show is original, with fine production value. The characters are entertaining and realistic. While I do wish there was more of the actual hands-on crime-solving that Holmes has become famous for (grovelling around with magnifying glasses, using small envelopes to pick up cigarette ash, etc.), and indeed some actual crime-fighting (nowhere near the Downey Jr. heights, but at least some hand-to-hand combat), the sleuth's impressive cerebral capabilities are on full display here.So in conclusion, Elementary all but destroys the mythology of Sherlock Holmes that came before it, and the stories bear no resemblance to the originals that we have all come to know and love. So it's weakest point is also it's strongest. The show has a fine cast, who all turn in good performances, and the series is entertaining, original, and fun to watch.I was introduced to Elementary by the Super Bowl ads. A friend nearby said, \"Oh yes, Elementary. It's a good show, yeah...it's a good show.\"And a \"good show\" is how I would describe it. Not great, like BBC's Sherlock (but that is an impossible comparison) but definitely worth your time watching it.Recommended highly! 4.1 Stars.P.S. Check out BBC's Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. In my opinion it is the finest TV out there right now. I eagerly await the third season!P.P.S. If this review was helpful, give it a like and write a comment, and read my other reviews! Cheers!"
B009IJJ5B4 Great acting, terrific scripts. . . Jonny Lee Miller is clearly not a one-persona character.  In Eli Stone, he was funny and ditsy.  Sherlock is darker and much more intense."
B009IJJ5B4 I love lucy in anything I've seen her in. This character has a lot of depth and I like the process of peeling the onions back on these two."
B009IJJ5B4 This is a great show. Love the interation between Watson and Sherlock. I never can wait to see the next episode."
B009IJJ5B4 Right out of the chute Sherlock and Watson were spectacular! I really enjoyed Johnny Lee Miller as Eli Stone (2008-2009).  However, he was superb as Jordan Chase (the evil villain) in Dexter (2010).  But with his true British accent as Sherlock, Johnny Lee Miller steps up to the plate and hits a homerun for the American audience.  His quirky personality, intellect and stage presence create one of the most fascinating characters on TV today.  Lucy Liu was outstanding in Ally McBeal (1998-2002).  Again, her true calling as a detective with Sherlock is the best character she has ever had the opportunity to experience.  Her quiet words, physical presence and beautiful poise compliments the Sherlock character so well that they are instinctually in sync.  Outstanding ! Amazing !  & Perfect.  The best TV series this 2012-2013 season."
B009IJJ5B4 This is a wonderful show, it really makes you think.  I got hooked on it and binge watched the whole season in a day.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of police or detective shows."
B009IJJ5B4 I have to say I like the BBC Sherlock better, but I like the interaction between the characters in this show. And I got used to Watson being a girl more easily than I anticipated."
B009IJJ5B4 The sherlock genre is so overdone that i thought there was no chance i would watch this show.  however, that was before i reckoned on johnny lee miller as sherlock. i think what is really working here is that this is the first time that someone has been cast as sherlock who is actually very appealing to women. this is of course deviating substantially from the arthur conan doyle sherlock, or so one would think.  because somehow miller otherwise remains very true to the sherlock on the page.  i have never seen this mix before. miller is much more versatile than i originally supposed.  he was anything but attractive playing the villain on dexter a few seasons ago.  he was quite good as a villain and not at all appealing.the show is clever too.  the scene pictured is sherlock working on corpses in the morgue for his equivalent of a body farm like lab exercise.  he is trying various killing maneuvers on the corpses.lucy liu is working as watson and i think the main reason she is is because the role is written and she is playing it very understated.  watson is always second banana to sherlock and any attempt to disrupt that would be disastrous.  but watson is also the voice of sanity when sherlock goes off the reservation.this episode involves exposing an angel of death in a hospital, who is killing terminal patients. there is an interesting twist to this episode which exposes another evildoer which is unexpected."
B009IJJ5B4 For all that Sherlock Holmes-type characters are lauded for their deductive abilities, what they're usually doing is induction, not deduction. Induction is the type of reasoning that goes from the specific to the general, e.g., he has blood on his sleeve therefore he is the murderer. This sort of reasoning is very unreliable and even the smartest people are wrong more than they're right. This means that Holmes and his ilk are fundamentally impossible characters, although Doyle's original is shown as less miraculous than most of the current iterations. The conclusions drawn by the character in this show are absurd."
B009IJJ5B4 I watched the last three episodes on Amazon Prime last night, and love the arc of the series. I recognize the updates of some of the original stories,  and I very much like the scruffy Holmes, the wounded Dr. Watson, and the cops, especially Aidan Quinn. I like the idea that even a brilliant mind can become addicted from self-medication, and that despite his many quirks, even the genius Holmes must deal with the realities of life. I also like that he is not celibate, as many of the other portrayals are, that he does not consider sex to be a distraction or reduction mental energy.  This Holmes is much less the gentleman, and his open appraisals are very effective in making people uncomfortable.OKAY, so I never met a Holmes I did not like, and I have read most of the original stories, and seen most the older movies with Basil Rathbone and others, and the new steampunk movies and the BBC versions. . I liked this enough that I paid to watch it. It was a good deal. Get it now."
B009IJJ5B4 What a connection these two actors share. The chemistry and performance of them both offer a truly tantalizing version of our Mr. Holmes. To have it based in the USA was a clever twist and only adds to the show's vibrancy."
B009IJJ5B4 I like this show-mostly because it doesn't have a bunch of teenage drama, naked people or ridiculous love triangles. It's a crime/drama with a unique story line and characters. I was a little worried the show was going to take a turn for the soap opera in the last episode, but in the end it worked out ok. (Don't want to spoil it for anyone!)"
B009IJJ5B4 I think that this is a smart twist to the original Sherlock homes. I really enjoy the interacts and discoveries you make along the way in each episode. It is smartly written and fun to watch. For those fans dedicated to the original a woman Watson and a tattooed Holms maybe to big of a jump of transition. All in all I like the show and look forward to continuing to watch."
B009IJJ5B4 As a fan of the BBC version of the updated Sherlock Holmes, I was very pleasantly surprised by the &#34;American&#34; version of the same character (s).  Clearly the writers put a different twist on the famous duo, but it works well.  The appeal is in the character of Sherlock himself.  He is a fictional personality, and given that he knows a myriad of facts, is not just well-read, but virtually is a &#34;super&#34; intellect and truly fascinating.  His egocentricity and slightly narcissistic qualities make him endearing if not annoying.  Joan Watson manages him well with maturity and compassion.  They ha
B009IJJ5B4 Love the show.  The characters of Holmes and Watson, though a little off beat, are superb.  The fast action keeps you captivated and I wouldn't miss an episode.  Both actors are wonderful.  And I like the fact that the show takes place in the states and that Holmes in no longer an addict.  The show is a wonderful mix of humor and drama.  Well worth the time to watch."
B009IJJ5B4 As a kid I grew up reading the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels and really enjoyed them all.  I&#8217;ve sampled some of the author&#8217;s who&#8217;ve tried with varying degrees of success to replicate Conan Doyle&#8217;s style and enjoyed a number of them.  On the screen there have been many depictions of the classic characters and with few exceptions (Robert Downey Jr&#8217;s versions leave much to be desired) have also been quite good.  It&#8217;s the recent attempts to modernize the tales and have them set in the present day that I&#8217;m less happy with.  Despite rave reviews the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Sherlock&#8221; with Benedict Cumberbatch was pretty boring.  So, when I saw CBS rolling out their series with the unknown to me Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes, recovering substance abuser and his &#8220;sober companion&#8221; ex-Dr. Joan Watson I was prepared to hate this show.  Let me say though I was wrong, this contemporary version of Holmes & Watson is a delight.  Mr. Miller is a bit manic at times but he&#8217;s fun to watch and the writers are excellent at coming up with interesting mysteries.  I&#8217;ve always been ambivalent about Lucy Liu and really only know her from the Charlie&#8217;s Angels movies which is hardly an endorsement. However, here as Joan Watson she is charming and spunky and is a good counterpoint for Miller&#8217;s hyperactive Holmes.  Together they make a fine pair of detectives and at least so far the showrunner&#8217;s have avoided messing things up with any hint of romantic interest between them.  I&#8217;m hoping to enjoy season 2 on DVD when it comes out.  Well done!"
B009IJJ5B4 Really good with great potential.  It had a slow start and the development of Watson was a bit on the dry side.  Granted, they were trying to cover quite a bit.  Look forward to more."
B009IJJ5B4 A modern day sherlock holmes with new stories and all the latest techniques.  I have been enjoying this series, and look forward to see what happens with the confrontation of Moriarity."
B009IJJ5B4 elementary is a modern take on sherlock holmes and watson,johnny lee miller is a fantastic actor and plays sherlock so well he really brings the character to life,i like the idea of watson being a girl,and being sherlocks companion i think it makes sense lucy liu does a fantastic job as watson this is a wonderful series and i hope it continues for a long itme"
B009IJJ5B4 if you enjoy your main characters being geniuses with issues that are severe and they view as acceptable then this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes might be the one for you.New York detective drama, comparable to CSI or NCIS with, as far as i'm concerned, better actors and more interesting case evolution."
B009IJJ5B4 Lucy Liu makes an interesting Dr. Watson, and an almost paranoid Sherlock Holmes, living in modern times, in my beloved N.Y.C, plus the 5 boroughs is a temptation I indulge in with pleasure and no guilt."
B009IJJ5B4 If this show stays away from the typical &#34;will they or won't they&#34; premise, it will be without a doubt my favorite show, and I dare say more enjoyable than the BBC &#34;Sherlock&#34;"
B009IJJ5B4 Jonny Lee Miller and the enchanting Lucy Liu are, quite simply, mesmerizing in this latest and highly effective rebirth of Conan Doyle's deathless consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes and his perennial sidekick, Dr. John (now Joan) Watson. I used to think no one besides Basil Rathbone could ever play Holmes, but the late Jeremy Brett managed it so well that I then became convinced that no one could ever replace him. He was Holmes come to life. Then came Benedict Cumberbatch - a truly remarkable actor who recreates Holmes in a thoroughly delightful and very different way, working now in the computer age. Now come Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, the first female Watson, in this very modern version set in present-day New York. Many familiar names from the original stories appear - Moriarty, Sebastian Moran, Irene Adler -  which adds to the fun, even if they are drastically altered. This series is unflaggingly entertaining and I hope it runs for many seasons."
B009IJJ5B4 Johnny lee millers performance is fantastic. He should be winning major awards. The entire cast does a great job and the writing is top notch. Excellent, excellent series"
B009IJJ5B4 I found this a bit slower than BBC's new show &#34;Sherlock&#34;. Arthur Conan Doyle would probably be pleased that his characters are alive and given a modern twist.  When I heard that Watson was a girl in this series I wasn't sure I would enjoy this show. (Not true to the books) And Sherlock as a recovering drug addict, while true to the story, came off a bit tame.  But after watching the first two shows I was hooked. Elementary is somewhat less about Sherlock being a know-it-all than the other Sherlock Holmes shows/movies, and more about character development.  Something of a shock was the reveal of Moriarty's true character (which I won't spoil here even with hints).  I look forward to Season 2."
B009IJJ5B4 I first enjoyed the modern Sherlock Holmes from the BBC.  Very enjoyable but the made so few episodes...  So when I heard about Elementary I thought to give it a try.  I feel it is far superior to the BBC production.  The Actor who plays Holms is so fun!  And they have abandoned the whole Arthur Conan Doyle story lines.  Which may be where the BBBc show is less appealing.  They are remaking classic stories.  But Elementary frees Holmes by placing him in New York with an addictions problem.  And gives it a more CSI approach, solving Modern cases with modern crimes.  I find it fascinating and wonderfully entertaining.  It really doesn't matter that Lucy Lu is in it.  Her part could be played by anyone.  It is all about Holmes and his delightfully sharp mind and wonderfully twisted personality!  Marvelous!!!"
B009IJJ5B4 No one ever seems to fear the daunting task of reinventing Sherlock Holmes and the complexities that make him unique in the world of fictional crime fighters. When Granada filmed the Doyle stories and cast the brilliant Jeremy Brett in the lead, Holmes was defined on film to perfection. Yet, here's but another spin. And what a great one it is. Up front you have Lucy Liu as Watson. There's a bit of imaginative casting. Her presence alone caught my attention and led me to the series.Add in the NYPD, city location shots and you run the risk of becoming predictable. Not so here. It's gritty, fast paced, more than a touch of humor and Holmes? Jonny Lee Miller has given us a Holmes who is a bit more damaged from his abuse and a bit more human because we have an underlying tragic story behind the abuse. He's arrogant, conceited and slovenly to the point of repulsion yet remains charismatic and compelling. The series is slowly evolving the relationship between Holmes and Watson, good indication they are looking for a long run. Give Lucy some scripts that will do justice to her immense acting talent and you're looking at an Emmy winning performance at some point. I truly enjoy this series and I find no flaws. Stay the course and a long run is guaranteed. Many of my friends are hooked as am I so lovers of detective fiction, Holmes and first rate acting, writing and direction will follow this show for a long time. I know I will. Can you really get enough of Lucy Liu?"
B009IJJ5B4 Too boring for words...the whole thing fell flat from beginning to end and I amazed I even got to the end or did I? Forgettable to say the least."
B009IJJ5B4 This is a great take on the original Holmes stories.  The acting is great!  I look forward to seeing it every week."
B009IJJ5B4 This show has been exhilarating and frustrating all at the same time, but it's grown in intensity to a magnificent season ending climax. One of the best detective shows I've ever seen, and I do love a good detective show! Plenty of interpersonal complexity to make it completely absorbing. Love it, just love it!"
B009IJJ5B4 Although Elementary season one, at least insofar as I have watched the episodes, is more of a weekly police procedural than a who done it, it is well written and very well acted.  One quickly forgets that a female Watson is unusual and that is a tribute to both the writing and the actors,  An enjoyable hour every time, which is more than most TV shows these days."
B009IJJ5B4 I wasn't sure about this show at first but now I'm hooked.  The actors work well together, the plots are believable and the sets interesting.  This is really the best program on tv at this time.  May it have many, many seasons to come."
B009IJJ5B4 Holmes reborn as the rich son of a wealthy Briton with a drug problem and a  broken heart. Clever! And, a new approach to Watson. Not just the old faithful, yet unimaginative, sidekick but an insightful woman in Lucy Lui. A budding detective in her own right. Very new age!Good supporting cast as well.My wife and I have enjoyed the entire season and look forward to season 2."
B009IJJ5B4 We enjoyed the first episode but will wait until we don't have to purchase it to watch the entire season."
B009IJJ5B4 Miller establishes his character's quirkiness from the start. It's nice to see Lucy Liu with an actual character to develop. And the always watchable Aidan Quinn gives us a subtle  New York accent. Not bad for a Chicago boy, an underrated talent."
B009IJJ5B4 The BBC series Sherlock proved Doyle's character could translate to current times and reach new audiences.  Elementary proves the same thing in New York.  Sherlock Holmes has always been a nuanced and layered character and Johnny Lee Miller is very good at keeping him interesting.  Lucy Liu stuns and gives Watson more depth than the character has ever had before. Great fun and enjoyable."
B009IJJ5B4 It would be hard to go wrong with Sherlock Holmes as your base story but the writers have captured even more than the original with this series.  The 2 main players Sherlock (played exceptionally well by Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson (played just as well by Lucy Liu)just add depth to an already interesting story each week.  This can be called a bromance, but one of the bros just happens to be a woman. He said that from the very beginning and I think it's really an apt description. There's this idea that a man and a woman can't be together on a show especially without needing to be together sexually or in love or whatever, and this is really about the evolution of a friendship and how that happens. Watching that should be as much the story of this show as the mysteries that you see week in and week out about who killed who.  I just know that after 3 episodes I am already addicted.  The addition of Aidan Quinn as Captain Tobias Gregson of the New York City Police Department was genius. He genuinely likes Holmes and the two have mutual respect for each other so we get to avoid the good cop bad cop plot lines that many shows that have talented citizens playing at detectives, I love The Mentalist but this show takes the genre to a new level of entertainment."
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is a pretty good show because this another cop-consultant show which I enjoy along with these other shows such as The Mentalist, Castle, Perception and Numbers. Johnny Lee Miller is very good at playing Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu also is terrific at playing Watson. Holmes and Watson always catch the criminals on this show and that is what I like about this program."
B009IJJ5B4 I hope this show runs for another 5 years!! They are excellent together."
B009IJJ5B4 The BBC was in a snit when CBS decided to rip off their concept of Holmes in a modern metropolis. Well, all credit to CBS. They pulled it off. Elementary isn't as glossy and sophisticated as the BBC effort led by Benedict Cumberbatch. But it's a first-rate procedural with crisp writing, good photography, and top-notch performances by Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu. Apparently it's doing well in the ratings, too. I look forward to seeing many more episodes."
B009IJJ5B4 I guess it's ironic that the Chinese doctor is minding the English heroin addict given England's Opium Wars against China.  Every episode feels empty and stylized not helped at all by the English accent and speaking manner of the lead actor - it feels very forced and performance-y.  I don't follow the OTHER Sherlock but I was VERY impressed by Benedict Cumberpatch's line delivery in Star Trek: Into the Darkness.THIS Sherlock is very affected, very look at how English I am.  It's no good if it's obvious."
B009IJJ5B4 I love it... I love Lucy Lui either way, but I feel they work well off each other. You can feel the bond they're building with each episode... or at least more puzzle pieces found to help complete the mystery of each of the characters. Both are brilliant in their own way. They're good for each other!"
B009IJJ5B4 We Loved this series. The on screen dynamic of Holmes and Watson is fresh and most enticing. Great to see a female Watson as companion. The stories are fresh and Moriarty is an interesting and refreshing twist on the usual villain."
B009IJJ5B4 After a couple of episodes Sherlock really began to emote which was something missing in the first episodes. Watson is good and getting more believable. Great story line. Love it"
B009IJJ5B4 love the contemporary spin on this.  Don't want to see them get involved too soon. At some point you know its going to happen, maybe in a dream sequence?"
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is a fantastic new series. It strikes a great balance of light hearted and serious. The banter between the two main characters underpins each week's story in such a way that you want to see what will happen next, but still feel a sense of closure with each week's ending. There is so much room for this series to grow; I can't wait to see where they take it for season 2."
B009IJJ5B4 The purists might not like this show (Watson is a girl in this version) but it is well-produced.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu have a good chemistry.  While British Sherlock shows are pretty good there aren't enough of them produced within a year for a hungry mystery-loving audience.  The complete season is worth purchasing."
B009IJJ5B4 Mundane, pedestrian, intellectually insulting. These are all things that Elementary wishes it could rise to the level of. It is too clearly gimmicky to be effectively a gimmick. A disappointment on every level and an insult to any actual Holmes fans. This so far removed from the greatness of the BBC series Sherlock that I  don't think it deserves to inhabit the same universe. The rest of the world must watch elementary and think it was intended for mentally challenged pre-schoolers. If your IQ is below 95, this program no doubt keeps you guessing, but then so would Sesame Street. If you like watching Lucy Liu disprove that Asian women are ageless in appearance, tune in. If you want to be entertained, buy paint...watch it dry."
B009IJJ5B4 I love this show because how the story context of &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; is blended into the modern version in the U.S. atmosphere. Weird may be, but it worked because the actors did a fantastic job in &#34;drawing&#34; audience like me into following this show. I am an avid fan of this show. I still enjoyed watching this show to this day."
B009IJJ5B4 Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex-surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu).  Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his `guardian'.  The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's `Tristan und Isolde'.  Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp, September 12"
B009IJJ5B4 I look forward to every show.  Seeing Watson catch the few thing that Holmes misses is really fascinating to watch."
B009IJJ5B4 the chemistry took a while to develop between the two but they really are a good match. the story lines are also pretty good - not the traditional run of the mill kind of story line.  the side characters, like the plow truck driver, are also a good additions the the episodes."
B009IJJ5B4 I've thoroughly enjoyed the first two episodes. Well cast and entertaining without the emphasis on blood and gore. Nicely done, not too scientific--just good entertainment in a semi-old fashioned crime-solving way."
B009IJJ5B4 Johnny Lee Miller in phenomenal as Sherlock, and I love that they give his character some extra edge, it makes him more approachable. Lucy Lui is fabulous and understated, yet she is always surprising us with her capabilities to keep up with Holmes., and their chemistry together is unmistakable. The writing is sharp, witty, engaging, and keeps us on our toes; it definitely rates as one of my favorite drama series to come along in quite a while."
B009IJJ5B4 In all the sherlock holmes, watson was the smart one, but hidden in the background.  However, I like the new twist on how they play out their character roles.  Adds that much more to it just like the Sherlock Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr."
B009IJJ5B4 The series keeps you intrigued and the relationship between Sherlock and Holmes is great. I'd recommend it for those who like mystery and subtle humor."
B009IJJ5B4 Although there is good chemistry between Sherlock and Joan Watson, the show can be hard to follow.  Sherlock speaks too fast at times and has a mumbling British accent.  The plots are interesting, but there is no depth in the lives of the other characters.However I plan to watch it next season because I have some hope for the show."
B009IJJ5B4 I'm a sucker for Sherlock Holmes. I was shamelessly addicted to the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett and the BBC's 'Sherlock' is one of my favorite shows still running on TV. Needless to say I'm enjoying 'Elementary' so far, even if I think there's room for improvement.One big thing 'Elementary' has going for it are the main characters. Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are a terrific team as Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson and their sober-companion relationship (both are recovering drug-addicts) gives a unique dynamic to these familiar characters; Watching Holmes explain his brain functionings to Watson after a sober meeting only to have her counter his ridiculous logic (\"the brain doesn't even work like that!\") was a hoot in this episode as well as seeing elements of the traditional Holmes (Watson finding his violin) shine through. I hope there's more familiar elements to come though; I like the idea that Miller is the traditional Sherlock who's completely fallen off the wagon but is now trying to put himself back together.While the character-work by the leads is first-rate in 'Elementary' the mysteries are all over the place, as is Holmes' deductive process. Perhaps it's an attempt to separate itself from 'Sherlock' and 'House' but the randomness (and unlikeliness) of 'Elementary's solutions makes everything feel cheap and artificial. That the supporting cast seems to be phoning it in doesn't help (and while I like Aidan Quinn and Jon Michael Hill I wish they had more to do than butt-heads with our detectives).So two episodes in I still like 'Elementary' even with my gripes. I love watching Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu and it gives me something to look forward to each week. I do hope the show gains a bit more confidence with it's stories and dips a bit more into the Sherlock Holmes canon (we have hints of Sherlock's father....perhaps an alias for his brother Mycroft?). But for now it's a fun enough show with two great main characters (and one awesome opening sequence!)."
B009IJJ5B4 I loved it: a mix of CSI, Monk and The Mentalist, it's witty, it has cliffhangers. I give it three thumbs up!"
B009IJJ5B4 Think &#34; murder she wrote&#34; only much better. The actors are wonderful. Jonny Lee Miller is crazy fun to watch, and Lucy Lui meshes well with him. This is a &#34; Thinkers&#34; and a Problem Solvers show. If you like detective work, you will love this one."
B009IJJ5B4 When I first saw the ads on CBS for this show I thought \"can't they come up with anything new?\". I was pleasantly surprised with this adaption of Sherlock Homes. In this version it's almost as though Mr Homes is a autistic savant in his rather rude behaviour and his his abilities to pick out clues, trends, and usually draw the correct conclusions."
B009IJJ5B4 I like holmes and Watson in this new addition to the A C Doyle and have read many of the novels and seeing it in the present with the ideas of the original it nice and fun to see"
B009IJJ5B4 UPDATE 5/22/13: NO SPOILERSHaving just finished watching the season finale, I was pleasantly surprised.  I still feel that the BBC program is superior and I still can't wrap my head around Lucy Liu, as \"Watson\".  However, I feel that show has significantly picked up the pace, in large part due to the \"Moriarty\" storyline.  Johnny Miller has started to really shine in the role.  I am still of the opinion that 2012 presented one of the weakest prime time TV seasons in recent memory.  My hope is that the Writers can keep up the positive momentum at the start of next season.NO SPOILERS:Nothing inherently wrong with \"Elementary\".  It is not unlike a number of other shows currently on TV that are mildly entertaining to watch, though you don't find yourself hoping that an episode extends, nor does it inspire \"water cooler\" conversation the next day.Interesting idea to cast a female of Asian heritage as Watson.  I am not sure that I like Lucy Liu in the role.  Aidan Quinn (NYPD Captain) is a fine actor, though he really hasn't been given much to do and his role to date has been promulgated to calling Holmes to request that he show up at one location or another.  Perhaps Quinn's role will expand over the course of the season.\"Elementary\" has a small cast, does not rely on any special effects, has a narrow location radius and to date relies much more on the spoken word than visuals.  The aforementioned is not a critique.  However, when a show is set up around 2-main characters and relies heavily on the spoken word, there has to be immediate chemistry and the the dialogue has to be compelling.  While there is room for improvement, I just don't see chemistry.The current version on the BBC (well reviewed on Amazon), is much darker and is layered with geometrically more complexity.  It is the BBC version that would receive my highest recommendation."
B009IJJ5B4 At first I was skeptical of this program... Lucy Liu as Watson? But it turns out to be good television. If you can suspend your reality and think Holmes in modern day New York and a woman as Watson, I think it will keep your attention."
B009IJJ5B4 Interesting take on Sherlock.  Love Watson!!  Not sure about Sherlock he's just a bit too disordered. Again watch it for Watson"
B009IJJ5B4 I love this show because it is detective, funny and real all at once. It is a very addicting show to watch."
B009IJJ5B4 You should include that it's only the Pilot - which I thought I was renting- now find out I'm paying for TV passes for Seasons that supposedly can stream free as a Prime member.  Any episode I missed on actual TV, I streamed from CBS, not knowing, perr Amazon's Customer Service, I'm supposed to be able to watch this FREE???  Is this saying the whole Season 1 is in my Video library?"
B009IJJ5B4 As a longtime Lucy Liu fan (Lucy you're great), I finally started watching this series recently and am enjoying it a lot.  The attention to story and visuals are compelling.  Lucy does a superb job of playing Watson as a character that the audience can relate to, in the modern-day New York setting for the series.  The other actors are also interesting to see and fit together well, for a first-season ensemble. The writing, DP, fx and scoring are all top-notch, and this is a well-produced show.-Ken"
B009IJJ5B4 For eight years I have been a Bones fan and five for Castle.  This out does both of them.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be pround of the writers."
B009IJJ5B4 Excellent reworking of Holmes and Watson.  Fun, serious and creative.  Lucy Lu is the best!  I stumbled onto this show and love it."
B009IJJ5B4 Unlike the previous reviewer, I totally thought this episode was brilliant! Although this storyline has been told before, I was totally not expecting it to turn out that way. That kid totally had me fooled! I consider myself somewhat of a crime buff and I didn't have a clue that the kid was just as responsible for the abduction and murder of those children as the balloon man himself. It was like watching a mini episode of the Richard Gere movie Primal Fear. This is a good series and I hope it stays on for a very long time!"
B009IJJ5B4 A great new take on Sherlock. You'll likely find him to be arrogant and irritating, but he grows on you. When you are &#34;just that good,&#34; being humble almost seems wrong. The female Watson, played by Lucy Lui is different but interesting. So much happens in the first season, I'm wondering how they could possibly keep me engaged for season 2, but I look forward to finding out this fall."
B009IJJ5B4 I am hooked on this new series. My only quibble is that the NYC cops who work with Holmes are written like cardboard throwaway characters. Only the police captain (played by the ever wonderful Aidan Quinn) is written with a deft touch. One of the things I like about this series (and I watch a lot of detective shows) is that the writers are very inventive about the reason for the murders, and in this episode combine two crimes - a robbery and a murder. Watson continues to try and get Holmes to share his feelings and more information about himself, which backfires when Holmes phones her ex-boyfriend and invites him over to their place for dinner. Watson keeps her work confidential and does not want to share that information with her ex or her family. The case itself revolves around family, an expected inheritance worth millions, and how inventive greedy people can be to claim a massive fortune. Zoe Keating's string pieces from the premiere episode (see my review) make another appearance, and Holmes picks up the violin to play. Great second episode. Let's see where the season takes us."
B009IJJ5B4 I love this show it is part too detective work and part comedy.  Look forward to it every week.  I buy it on amazon.com weekly"
B009IJJ5B4 As much as this incarnation of Sherlock is learning from his Dr. Watson, she, likewise, is learning from him.  In this episode, her mind seems a bit sharper and more engaged in Sherlock's investigation.  In addition, we learn more about this Sherlock's personal life and the lack of connection with his only living parent.  While Watson tracks this down and, later, challenges him to connect with her on a personal level, Sherlock is following the smallest of clues to determine why a plane crash happened and who murdered one of the occupants.I have read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's complete works of Sherlock Holmes and seen most of the BBC rendered Sherlock Holmes series.  I think he would be pleased at the lack of orthodoxy in this adaption and, perhaps, even pleased that his character could be stretched wide and far into the next millenia.  I am particularly pleased at the introduction of Watson as female and the emotions this elicits from Sherlock's character.  Also, a shout out to Aidan Quinn as the mature, trusting and guiding force to Sherlock's schemes.Maybe this won't be as lasting as the original stories but, then, neither is Shakespeare staged as though written in the 20th Century.  Either way, it is a good ride, compelling, and worth a watch."
B009IJJ5B4 An interesting take off of Arthur Conan Doyle detective. And who does not like Lucy Lu. Where are all these crime fighters in real life?"
B009IJJ5B4 Lucy Liu makes the show wonderful. She is wonderful and gives the show balance. She should have a stronger part"
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is another one of the American tv programs which I admire. I plan to collect them all. I hope it continues for years."
B009IJJ5B4 favorite show ever, they are so smart and i love smart people, but i learn a lot about medicine and i lvoe lucy's fashion"
B009IJJ5B4 Just downloaded the pilot of this show and loved it.  I watch a lot of mysteries and this is top quality.  It has the intensity of the British version SHERLOCK, which we love, but with more of a NYC than London vibe.  Can't wait for my son who lives and works in NYC to come home and watch these episodes with me.  He enjoyed SHERLOCK (and DOWNTON ABBEY) and has been asking if I've found another equally good series.  Glad to have them in our private library.The plot was intriguingly complex, good NYC gritty scenery, like the actors.  This looks like a very fresh and original series. These are going to be addictive, I can see already."
B009IJJ5B4 As an avid Sherlock Holmes fan since childhood I have watched and reviewed many different interpretations over the years.Elementary has very interesting elements to it, which I believe stand it apart from previous Sherlock Holmes. The first of these elements is that it is set in a modern day, which by itself is not totally unusual as BBC has also produced an SH series which does the same. This gives it somewhat more of a real feeling, as it is not a \"forensic\" show persay but more of what Holmes is famous for - Deductive Reasoning.The second of these elements that set it apart is that Dr. Watson is a female. While I am excited about the concept of a female Watson, I remain scepticle about the implications that they will be able to continue to maintain a platonic relationship long-term. While Dr. Watson is traditionally the only person that can weather Holme's somewhat abrasive nature and maintain some semblance of dignity, it just doesnt translate as well to the female gender, even though so far in the show Lucy Liu has done a very admirable job of doing just that.The third element which has been introduced as a seperation to other SH series is the drug addiction. One that I have to say I am not overly fond of. We get the very vague and general sense that Holmes abused drugs as a reaction to a traumatic event that happened previously in his life, but that card has been overly played in modern series.All in all I give this a 5 for casting, great storyline, writing, and originality. The small flaws it has are easily erased by the great dynamics of the crime-fighting duo."
B009IJJ5B4 This is so smart. The characters so carefully drawn. The plotting so cohesive. The acting so outstanding. Beyond doubt, for me, the most satisfying drama on television."
B009IJJ5B4 I am a huge fan of \"Elementary\", starring Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.  The writing always keeps me guessing, and I love the chemistry between Holmes and Watson.  I have purchased every episode through Amazon Instant Video so that I can enjoy the show on my own schedule and without commercials.  I am rating the show with 5 stars; however, I am disappointed with Amazon right now because episodes 23 and 24 are still not available.  PLEASE hurry and upload the finale Amazon.  Excellent show!"
B009IJJ5B4 Johnny Lee Miller's portrayal is so endearing: his Sherlock is damaged and quirky, without the overpowering condescension we seen in the British TV version. The storyline is genius: Watson = female sober-companion, and subtly played by Lucy Liu - whose character has her own damage-stuff going in. The cases are interesting. Aiden Quinn is lovely in his role - he always brings such gravitas. It's a GREAT show."
B009IJJ5B4 I've seen many versions of Sherlock Holmes stories and just when I thought I had seen them all, Elementary comes by.  Love the acting, love the production and story line.  Jonny Miller and Lucy Liu are great actors and make you believe in the series."
B009IJJ5B4 I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes from books to movies since I was a kid. The books may be what drew some fans in but for me it was growing up with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and Holmes and Watson, solving crimes by using brains instead of brawn. The recent films starring Robert Downey Jr. are a favorite now as is SHERLOCK on BBC starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Add to that a new updated version of Holmes in the CBS series ELEMENTARY, the first season of which was just released on DVD.Johnny Lee Miller stars as the famous sleuth in current times New York. Having recently moved from England his wealthy father has set out to help him by hiring a full time sobriety partner to aid Holmes with his drug addiction problem (fans of the books will recall Holmes dabbled in cocaine use). It seems that a problematic case led to Holmes downfall but he insists he's cured and not in need of help. His sobriety partner, Dr. Joan Watson (Lucy Liu), isn't interested in his opinion since she was hired by his father.Watson brings along baggage of her own. Her career as a surgeon was cut short by problems she had that led to a mistake. It doesn't take long for Holmes to ferret this out. Knowing that an attempt to dismiss her would be futile he instead takes her along with him whenever the New York police department calls on him to assist in a case.When in London Holmes made a friend of New York detective Capt. Toby Grayson (Aidan Quinn). Realizing what a help he could be in certain cases, Grayson calls on Holmes when the unusual case pops up. Fortunately for the series that happens at least once a week.The cases the duo work on range from wealthy Wall Street denizens to mercy killings in hospitals to plane crash victims. Each time while the rest of the New York police department thinks there is no foul play involved Holmes proves them wrong. As the series plays out we also come find out about why Holmes began using drugs and who pushed him in that direction. It was his infamous arch enemy, Moriarty.What makes this series work is the interplay between the two lead characters. Miller's take on Holmes is a quick thinker who sees the world completely different from everyone else. Nearly everything within eye sight is a clue and the fact that others can't recognize this is something that often infuriates him.Watson on the other hand is more interested in keeping Holmes sober, the job she was hired for. Throughout season one the opportunity for him to fall off the wagon comes on rare occasions and eventually even Watson realizes that he part in helping him is better served as a companion when it comes to his cases. Watson becomes someone to bounce ideas off of and eventually someone that Holmes decides would be better served as an apprentice of sorts. It's a choice that Watson eventually faces before the season ends.Placed in the hands of lesser actors this series would fall flat on its face. But both Miller and Liu bring something fresh to an age old story that works incredibly well. Miller's frenetic movements and habits as Holmes give him an edge that replaces the physical aspects of most detectives seen on TV these days. Liu's interest in helping Holmes through his problems while sorting out her own demons is played without bringing into the role a romance that would seem out of place with these two. While they have a respect for each other and what they can both do turning this into MOONLIGHTING or CASTLE would ruin it. It's better that they play off of one another than fall in love.The series has been renewed for a second season and thank goodness for that. It makes watching TV worthwhile when it's on. Until that season starts, and for those who made the mistake of missing it, the first season on DVD is one worth adding to your collection. While being a Sherlock Holmes fan helps your enjoyment of the series isn't dependant on that. Instead just sit back and try to solve each case with Watson before the end of each show."
B009IJJ5B4 We are enjoying this amazing series. Sherlock is cast perfectly with Jonny Lee Miller. The choice for a Doctor Watson was a surprise in many ways but Lucy Lui has been quite interesting in this role and has proven to us that she is the perfect choice for Watson as well.we look forward to every show and it is a &#34;do not miss&#34; for us."
B009IJJ5B4 Though I cannot approve of all of the content (like glimpses of nudity), I nevertheless totally enjoyed it. They did a good job retelling the old story in modern times."
B009IJJ5B4 2013:Season 1 - (5-stars)Smart, thoughtful, quick-witted, and genuine chemistry between Jonny Lee Miller & Lucy Liu (quite the strange pair)Season 2 - (4 stars)Everything great from season 1 except it seems slowerAlso, something was lost from season 1 to season 2 - don't know what it is (camera shots, editing, writing, Lucy's wardrobe, slower dialog, ??).More Lucy legs was a good thing, but definitely lost it's luster."
B009IJJ5B4 I like a good mystery story and this one hits the spot.  It's fast paced and the characters click together."
B009IJJ5B4 Each episode of this show features a murder and holmes must solve them. but there is a back story that unfolds as the series progresses. And in this show watson is a woman , played by lucy lui!. The show is a monster hit and it's engaging. I missed the second episode and therefore had to go back and watch it on amazon.com video. THis is a good show for mystery fans and for fans of sherlock holmes. IN this version sherlock is not a sociopath like in the bbc modern version 'sherlock' , he's a guy struggling with addiction and such. It was a gamble that paid off for it's network and the strong acting of it's leads makes for a compelling show. It does need more of moriarty though."
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is just another spin on the &#34;genius detective&#34; genre of crime shows. The show tries to be a little different by placing Sherlock Holmes in modern day New York, making him a recovering drug addict, and turning Watson into a woman played by Lucy Liu. If you suspend your disbelief an accept the premise, the show is okay. The BBC's does a better updated Holmes with its show &#34;Sherlock&#34;"
B009IJJ5B4 The characters grow and evolve. it's not an just plug in a new villain same ole formula show. I enjoyed it enough that I have bought the tv pass for season 2"
B009IJJ5B4 I am a fan of other crime dramas e.g. Castle, Bones, etc.  I also am a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I love the modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I will admit that reading the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, I can get a little lost in the references of modes of transportation and techniques that are over a hundred years old. This show helps to bridge that gap, so we are working with cell phones and cars, which is something I can relate to.The acting is great. I love that they chose Lucy Liu for the part of Watson.The story telling is good. The stories are good.I also appreciate the show is relatively clean. The themes can be adult but they don't seem to be trying to push the the envelope with the content."
B009IJJ5B4 I like the tension between the lead and Lucy Liu. She's a bit wooden, but it's a decent series. I like it better than some of the other Sherlock Holmes series that have turned up lately."
B009IJJ5B4 Missed seeing Unforgettable, Body of Proof and other recently introduced shows.  Will not pay to have instant video on most of the junk, but eagerly await each episode of this new show."
B009IJJ5B4 Always liked him - since Hackers. He plays an emotionally stunted Sherlock perfectly and the plots are very interesting. Character development is a bit slow but it raises the audience's curiosity into his past. Not crazy about Lucy Lu - never smiles and is a bit too cold."
B009IJJ5B4 I am interested in watching it but I won't say, I rush home to in order to tune in. I do like the &#34;detective work&#34; that is in it. But not what I anticipated Sherlock to be like."
B009IJJ5B4 Am totally enjoying this series.  And I have to pay per episode for it, since Amazon Prime's not yet available in my country of residence. Amazing how fascinating Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes continues to be"
B009IJJ5B4 This show is really smart and entertaining.  I enjoy the characters and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys police procedurals."
B009IJJ5B4 If you like this show, you must not have read Arthur Conan Doyle's books, or watched the old Basil Rathbone movies--which I recommend.  I thought this series might be good because it has Lucy Lui.  It is just another cop show with a smart cerebral main character.  He is just too clever for words.  The characters are nothing like Watson and Holmes. Holmes would never try to burn his violin.  I would rather watch reruns of Monk.  He has his problems, but he is not rude and nasty. Does this Holmes ever take a shower, he looks so grungy!"
B009IJJ5B4 This is a fresh concept on the Sherlock Holmes series.  Jonny Lee Miller [Trainspotting] is great as Holmes with Watsonre-imagined as a female [Lucy Lui].  The two actors seem like an odd couple but blend seamlessly.  Very good show."
B009IJJ5B4 Interesting twist on one of my favorite stories.  The updated characters are good and I look forward to more episodes."
B009IJJ5B4 with Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson (Lucy Liu) portrayal of his beloved characters. After being able to accept Holmes and Watson as 2013 human beings, it really comes together nicely. The entire cast, writers et al deserve a five star rating for humor, entertaining episodes and surprises. Watch more than one or two episodes and you'll be hooked, if you are a Holmes fan."
B009IJJ5B4 I wasn't sure about this program, but it has proven to be intelligent, funny, witty and a wonderful the cast is amazing."
B009IJJ5B4 The subject matter of this episode is very familiar, I've seen it fictionalized before and even read news stories that were similar. Therefore, in order to make its mark, Elementary has to do it one step better than the previous shows. It has not.Past: A boy leaves his home and is abducted off the street. Balloons are left as a thank you for his parents by the kidnapper. Through the years more children are kidnapped. Some are found dead. Others aren't found at all.Today: A seventh child is abducted from her home. Her parents are abrasive, not sympathetic. Her father left her alone in the house to meet a former lover, and lies about it until Holmes confronts him. The woman he met was a witness to the kidnapping, she saw the escape vehicle. (At a later point the parents even suggest trading the first victim back to the kidnapper to secure the release of their daughter. When their demand is not agreed to, they then threaten to hold the captain responsible for all consequences).Watson manages to be more abrasive/intrusive than Holmes himself. The constant sniping and need to have the last word is irritating. Elementary is not improved by this Watson. Unless you appreciate that Holmes finds clues while he is trying to run away from her.The young man who was the first victim many years ago, is discovered driving the kidnapper's van and taken into custody while trying to flee. He refuses to help the police find the kidnapper. He has become attached to the man. This process is carefully explained to us.Holmes shares some of his own \"history\" with the rescued youth during an interview. Interesting tidbit if it is true (Holmes is evasive on the point later). He goes through his lightning quick analysis in a few locations. Very clever. He consistently maintains his emotional distance or does he show actual empathy? He discovers the little clues that others miss. His energy is toned down in this episode. Perhaps he finds listening to Watson as tiring as I do. Whatever the cause, he is less the scene stealer here. Still watchable, tho.The police are a touch too oblivious. They dash into the kidnapper's home, right past balloons in an empty room, then state they have nothing. Until Holmes tells them to go back. They find the incredibly obvious balloons and an attached USB drive. Too much Keystone Cops to be credible.Victim #1 is talked into signing an immunity agreement. In an act of atonement he reveals the kidnapper's new residence. The police bust in and rescue the little girl. The kidnapper commits suicide. The child is unharmed. Uhhhh, really?The psychology is interesting, make no mistake. But there are too many detractions to make this an improvement over the previous episodes of Elementary. Holmes finding a loophole in the immunity agreement is too predictable, not fresh at all. His pitting his wits against the clever young murderer who was Victim #1 is sort of bland.Sure they get their guy in the end, outwitting him. It just didn't quite meet its full potential. 2.75 stars rounded up to 3. Mea Culpa, I watched it twice.(If you are going to watch this more than once, as I did, not having to sit through the repetitive commercials is a great motivator to buy the episode at Amazon.)"
B009IJJ5B4 This is a nice updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Watson. It has good stories and is well acted -- an enjoyable TV show."
B009IJJ5B4 What a hoot this show is. Sherlock and Doctor Watson are an entirely different kind of team.  Each has their own particularly different personality and way of doing things.  This is not your Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce detective team!  It's a refreshing new rendition that will keep you in suspense as well as laughing out loud."
B009IJJ5B4 Although Sherlock Holmes has been a staple of my entertainment life I was not disappointed but I wasn't enthralled either. I have no doubt that I will enjoy further efforts, but there is the nagging hangnail that I might opt-out for the other show if the rememberability of this opus is not ascended. I want to watch!! The characters have enough meat on them to suffice but everybody like myself wants an ample and hearty meal of entertainment intrigue. &#34;Elementary&#34; could very well become a league favorite, but behind the scene arteries need to be dilated a bit more to secure a baited plateau in the minds of consumers."
B009IJJ5B4 I love Lucy and they make a great team!  It's a little predictable but still entertaining and do look forward to watching it each week.  I'm also glad that it has more than 13 episodes to a season."
B009IJJ5B4 I really enjoy watching this show and the development of the relationship between Sherlock and Watson.  At first, I didn't know how I'd like a woman playing Watson, but it really works on this show."
B009IJJ5B4 this show does not shy away from boldy taking a stand on re-interpreting well defined characters and, if not re-inventing them,..at least revamping them. I am a huge fan of Cumberbatch and the BBC show Sherlock,..and this in no way invades their space or diminshes the vim and vigor of either show. Lucy Liu owns her Watson and Johnny is just Fun whenever he is on screen...New fans of Holmes, and old ones will find much to lover here."
B009IJJ5B4 I missed this program one night and downloaded it to my Kindle to watch.  I love this program and hope it stays on the air for a while."
B009IJJ5B4 I loved this episode.  The ending was a little unexpected which made it fun.  They developed a bit more of the Holmes-Watson partnership.  I like that Watson is a woman.  It gives it a cool little kick.  I like that she stands up to him, but is also starting to get how he thinks instead of just being offended or awed.  They threw in some classic Holmes \"moves\" in the boardroom.I think you would be OK watching this episode out of order.  You might be a little lost, but you'd catch on quickly."
B009IJJ5B4 I love this adaptation of the classic Sherlock Holmes. Warning: it is not for those who only enjoy the traditional view of Sherlock but I really enjoy it!"
B009IJJ5B4 I have not watched the season on DVD but have caught every episode.  Love the series and look forward to it."
B009IJJ5B4 I am following this new show with great anticipation and interest.  The acting is excellent and the storylines are unique - definately the twists and turns you'd expect from a good Sherlock Holmes story.  I watch the shows again and again."
B009IJJ5B4 I didn't think I would like this show but was pleasantly surprised to find I liked it a lot.  The two main characters (Watson and Sherlock) were exellently cast and it works.  The premise is Sherlock is a brilliant man who had worked as a consultant with the police in solving crimes but looses the woman he loves to a serial killer, which drives him into drug use.  His father is wealthy and puts him into rehab.  When he is released his father pays for a companion to see he attends meetings and eats properly, etc.  Watson was a surgeon who kills someone on the operating table and thus leaves her profession.  She is intriqued by Sherlock's ability to see things at a crime scene that others do not.  She finds herself excited about solving crimes.  The first glimmer of interest for her since her exit from surgery.  Lots of chemistry between the two.  The police chief is well cast and his character appreciates Sherlock's abilities and makes allowances for his excentric behaviors.  Check out this show.  I'm praying it's not canceled as so many good, new shows are.  Highly recommended."
B009IJJ5B4 This is a great show. I have injoyed this new show with great character mix. I would love to see this show continue."
B009IJJ5B4 The wife and I enjoy watching Elementary in our regular TV viewing schedule. We like the two main characters and while it is a nod to the original Sherlock Holmes stories, we've enjoyed the change ups and the story telling. We also appreciate the fact that the show doesn't rely on gratuitous sex, violence, or foul language."
B009IJJ5B4 While we've seen the basic storyline of these kinds of series(The Mentalist/NYPD Blues/CSI/Law&Order,etc,etc) the characters personal storylines and episode stories still maintain a good deal of entertainment and enjoyment for myself and many people who watch the series. There does feel a little bit of deja vu between this series and the Mentalist, as you have a quirky but intelligent and resourceful man battling his inner demons personal tragedy to help his police comrades solve crimes and his female partner who keeps him in check and helps him along the way while growing in her own way. Still the series is entertaining and exciting to watch and I truly appreciate that it has been renewed for a second season. So for fans of cop dramas or just those looking for a good series to check out here's one to look at."
B009IJJ5B4 I think I've watched every episode of this series and have found it to be entertaining and I love the characters. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the updated Sherlock Holmes and Watson but Lucy Liu is wonderful and Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as the modern day Sherlock Holmes. As another reviewer stated I am SO SICK of so-called \"reality\" tv shows it's refreshing to find television can still be well written and acted and fun to watch!"
B009IJJ5B4 A very charming if not slighly disarming twist on an old tale.  Sherlock is not your typical consulting detective in this one.  When he had only one hour to be released formally from rehab, he releases himself.  Watson, a retired doctor now is a live in rehab counselor, and imspector Gregson (a character from The Red Headed League) is a police leut. in NYPD.  Yep, not your typical Holmes but all the more reasons to enjoy it."
B009IJJ5B4 The show is a well written. The show has a good cast. I like this show because it is a modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery."
B009IJJ5B4 Perhaps one of the greatest shows on TV.  Reminiscent of &#34;HOUSE&#34;, I see a lot of parallels (scruffy beard, drug use, arrogance, inspiration (often the final clue to the mystery) from his associate(s), and general genius) which I enjoy immensely.  I had the opportunity to watch the Pilot and early episodes again.  Watson (I LOVE Lucy Liu) was a little rough in the beginning -- but it takes time to establish the chemistry.  They are a PERFECT pair now.  These are very well (but not perfectly) thought out mysteries and Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Bell all work amazing well together.  Two words: WATCH IT!  (It would be nice if Sherlock started calling her Dr. Watson -- the only thing I miss about the characters.)  Oh, and the whole Moriarty sub plot/story &#8211; excellent!!!  (No spoiler here.)"
B009IJJ5B4 I love this version of Sherlock Holmes.  Jonny does an excellent job with this character and I equally love Lucy portrayal ofWatson.  I also appreciate her credentials as a doctor.  Their chemistry together is exciting to watch.  I am looking forward to the next season."
B009IJJ5B4 This is a wonderful show.  It is great to see a totally new show with such wonderful acting and writing.  So often on network TV you don't get that combination."
B009IJJ5B4 When I saw the previews, I wasn't sure I was going to like it - in fact, I was prepared not to. Lucy Liu has been starring in a string of flops over the last decade so seeing her in this did not seem to bode well for the success of the show. And, to be honest, I don't really feel that she adds all that much substance, diversity or interest to the show at all. Still - I have to admit that it's much better than I thought it would be. Aiden Quinn as the police captain is well-placed, and Angelina Jolie's long-ago ex-husband, Johnny Lee Miller, does a superb job as the erratic recovering drug addict genius and jack of all trades, Sherlock Holmes.All in all, the modern transition went quite well in this one."
B009IJJ5B4 Only because we are such Sherlock Holmes fans did we even turn on this series, mainly to make fun of it.  Now it is the most anticipated TV show each week in our house.  Wonderful, inventive, creative.  Excellent Series."
B009IJJ5B4 A refreshing vision of Sherlock and Watson. The stories are fresh, if not particularly challenging. Production values are excellent. Good show. Doyle might even approve."
B009IJJ5B4 I have to admit I was not that exited to watch this episode as I am a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes.  The only reason why I did decide to watch it was because I like the twist of having Lucy Liu playing Dr Watson.  The writers have done an outstanding job with a story line that follows, perfectly what a modern day Sherlock Holmes would be like living in NYC."
B009IJJ5B4 Sherlock and Joan are fabulous together.  And Johnny Lee is a great actor.  I remember him from Eli Stone.  I loved his character.Talk about night & day in characters and the 90 degree turn from Basil Rathbones Sherlock.  He has made Sherlock his own and taken nothing away from Rathbones characterization.  Lucy Lui is also great.  After seeing her in Angels I didn't quite see her as Joan at first, but she is also sensational in her role.  This is a great show and Rathbones fan should appreciate the superior intelligence of Jonny's' portrayal as Sherlock and how he made him his own and not a carbon copy."
B009IJJ5B4 One of the few shows we found we waited for each week. We don't watch a lot of tv but my husband and I organized our schedules around both being home and awake to see this. I really like the Aidan Quinn  and the cops."
B009IJJ5B4 Fresh writing, good stories, great acting/directing... this series is fun and well done.  I make it a point to record, if I'm not home to watch.  5 stars!"
B009IJJ5B4 If you like Sherlock Holmes you will probably watch this.  I liked it but it's not close enough to what I think Holmes and Watson should be like.  I will probably watch episode 2 just to see if it gets better.  Make up your own mind."
B009IJJ5B4 Love the drama between the 2 actors and the direction their life is leading them while they themselves are trying to get over the past that haunts them."
B009IJJ5B4 I thoroughly enjoy watching \"Elementary\" -- it is a superbly entertaining, updated version of Sherlock Holmes. The acting is first rate, as are the mysteries. There is always the concern with predictably, but that has not yet befallen this show. And I believe the chemistry between Miller's Holmes and Liu's Watson is very appropriate --- since it isn't supposed to devolve into some sort of physical affair. They are reluctant, yet true friends, and this update's FEMALE Watson is a refreshing contribution to the long history of portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.I must admit, it is difficult NOT to watch this show ... And I like the surprising, yet plausible journey that occurs in every episode. Miller plays Holmes in a very engaging way -- complete with all of the idiosyncrasies a fan of the character can appreciate. And Liu's Watson is just as engaging -- and plays an excellent foil for Holmes, as any fan of the character would expect. It is always a gamble when writers (and actors) try to update or contemporize iconic characters ... this time, they all got it right! I've watched each episode and am impressed every time!"
B009IJJ5B4 Always fun to watch.  However, at times it is hard to understand what Sherlock is saying because of his English accent."
B009IJJ5B4 Johnny Lee Miller is great, as is the rest of the castbut I watch it for free on uverse, I don't pay for it hereinteresting change of pace, setting it in modern day NYC & a different dynamic with a female WatsonI do love the BBC version with Benedict Cumberbatch (sp?), as well"
B009IJJ5B4 When I first heard of this show I was hoping for something like &#34;Zero Cool&#34;, Jonny Miller's character in Hackers and &#34;O-Ren Ishii&#34;, Lucy Liu Ai Maeda's character in Kill Bill solving crimes.  It's not that but it is a lot of fun. (Spoiler)  Both of them are playing people who don't know how to fight even though the actors totally do. it is an interesting take on Holmes and Watson.  I do think that Lucy Liu's character needs a stronger role though.  I have a hard time believing she is anyone's sidekick."
B009IJJ5B4 The actor portraying Holmes is about the most annoying person I have had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to...if that makes sense.I would rather rather lose toenails, one-at-a-time to Moriarty than listen/watch Holmes."
B009IJJ5B4 I never thought I would see another movie or series that I would like regarding Sherlock Holmes.  When I first caught an episode of Elementary, I got hooked and between each episodes storyline and the characters evolving, I can't wait for each new episode to be released.  Having made Dr Watson a woman in this program was a unique but very welcomed change.  Unlike Nigel Bruce who kind of played a more bumbling character, Lucy Loo is quickly rising to Holmes' level."
B009IJJ5B4 When I first heard about Sherlock Holmes in New York City and Watson being cast by Lucy Liu, I was almost sure this would suck.  I was wrong.  Elementary has turned out to be a great show that is fun to watch."
B009IJJ5B4 I love the idea of Sherlock in New York and I especially enjoy Lucy Lu as Dr. Watson.  Great purchase.  A+++Super fast shipment."
B009IJJ5B4 i really wanted to like this show, and it is just ok. I think they are trying to hard to make sherlock like a bad@ss hipster guy, and really the main thing i like about the show is Lucy Lu"
B009IJJ5B4 This show is intelligent , witty, funny and educational ( for recovering addicts ).  I love scripted shows with a touch of these elements , I tend to gravitate to mystery , murder and the cat and mouse crime shows with unique twists.  The Elementary keeps my attention and gives me pleasure to watch an excellently scripted show."
B009IJJ5B4 This newest version of Sherlock Holmes is very fun and interesting.  The lead actors are very good, with on-screen chemistry, and work well together.  Episode plots are plausible and sometimes intricate. Added to my &#34;must see&#34; shows list."
B009IJJ5B4 My wife and I really like this show and consider Holmes and Watson to be very well portrayed.  It's especially interesting that Holmes, brilliant as he is, is such a vulnerable, and I guess, all-too-human, figure, an unusual thing given his soaring intellect and obviously well-honed perception."
B009IJJ5B4 This is on par with NCIS in my opinion. The acting is very good and the plots interesting.I do hope they keep the show for another season."
B009IJJ5B4 Love the show, the mixture of comedic and dramatic acting are very enjoyable. If I have one criticism the British accented  dialog is very fast and sometimes difficult to understand."
B009IJJ5B4 It was a good idea to make Watson a woman, (still want to know more of her backstory) They make the odd couple thing work in a way that adds to the stories. Holmes is a constant source of surprises and his continual lack of consideration is amusing. The stories are well done with twists that add interest. I hope it stays around for many years to come"
B009IJJ5B4 Elementary is entertaining. I recommend it for the primary reason it is keeping one of literatures great characters alive one hundred and twenty some odd years after he was created. Now that is a viable character; and there aren't that many to begin with. Plus, Sherlock Holmes the character something to teach about observation. The programme itself is Ok in my opinion. Don't expect to be electrified, though those new to the character might be electrified by the mental acuity of Holmes."
B009IJJ5B4 We love Elementary! What a surprise to find a new show that is so good. Sometimes the plot has some slightly distasteful aspects, but they evaporate as the episode moves on.Streaming Elementary is so nice with no commercials. We are older than the commercials target age group, so many commercials do not apply to us."
B009IJJ5B4 I was skeptical of this when it started because I LOVE the BBC Sherlock series and thought this would be a knockoff. It really is a different take on the idea that doesn't (at least in my mind) conflict at all with the BBC version. I love them both and this show is off to a really great start."
B009JARQ3G I spent 5 seasons needing to keep notes on this well filmed, often well written, series- details presented one season seemed to return later on. I watched every episode of this final short season because of it's past quality, and mostly because of that. Based on a one off episode in 4th season I always had a feeling of incompleteness with this one.Season 4 ended with the Obervers writing Peter out of the timeline we were familiar with just as peace was achieved between the two universes. 5 starts with our guys preserved in Amber, the Observers having taken over decades ago and rattled on to a very unsatisfactory, sloppy ending.After Walter & the Observer boy traveled to the future origin point of the Observers, thus stopping their creation, time was reset- but only to the moment before the start of the invasion (if the Observers never existed then the reset would be to a time before the series ever started). So many threads left hanging I wonder if the producers had ideas for a full season but got funding cut off and had to cobble things together? I would've liked 5 better if it'd had a few more episodes."
B009JARQ3G i just discovered this series this year and i have become addicted. it's been so long since a true scifi came alongeven the sci fi channel has been turned over to wrestling, and everything other than sci fi"
B009JARQ3G Finally, a series that gets it right. Good amount of humor mixed with thrilling mysteries and science fiction. I was even happy with the ending, which is a first for me. Great way to waste an hour or 2 every night! :)"
B009JARQ3G I am so sad that this series is going to be over.  It has been one of my constants, and a much looked to escape from my job in the fringe division of my profession. Fortunately! With Amazon Prime, I can get Fringe ALL DAY LONG FOR FREE!I've been watching the first season as I have been watching the (sob) last, and it has been interesting to see the character development and interaction.  It's too bad they couldn't have kept Detective Francis.  Although, the story leading to his exit was intriguing. The characters of Olivia's sister and niece made her more personable, and therefor more vulnerable, but not in a good way. Of course, Peter and Olivia's relationship has been a big draw for me, but my very favorite character, and the one who has made this show a hit is Walter Bishop played by that great actor John Noble. He plays the gamut of emotions, levels of sanity, changes from a self-absorbed-egomaniacal-genius-mad scientist to a loving father. His relationship with Astrid is the best. He starts with asking her- everytime he sees her - &#34;who are you?&#34; to calling her by some derivation of her name (Astro, Asterisk) . You can tell that Walter has come to recognize as being human, when he starts calling her Astrid.My favorite scene of all time (so far -- haven't seen finale yet) is in Season 5, where they are looking for September and Walter stops Peter, looks at him deeply and earnestly and tells him of all the memories, from different timelines, that he has of him.  Walter tells Peter, &#34;Son, I couldn't love you any more.&#34; Peter watches his father walk away with the face of a twelve year old boy who used to run down the stairs when he smelled pancakes cooking, because it meant his dad was home.  I have to admit, I watch that scene over and over.lOH, yes, I will miss the new stories. Miss being surprised and trying to figure it out.  Thank you to the writers, crew, cast, etc for giving us five years of Fringe. AND THANK YOU JOHN NOBLE FOR SHARING YOUR INCREDIBLE TALENT!:"
B009JARQ3G Fringe division, a group that starts out investigating the odd, strange and unexplainable, sort of an x-files but generally with some type of resolution.Somewhere around season 2, it starts to morph into this thing that becomes more involved with saving Peter (Walter the crazy scientist's son) and / one of the two universes.(Why only two universes?)Season 3 - 4 more of the same, sacrifices are made, the 2 univserses are made whole, but you have these nasty observers that are in mucking things aboutSeason 5 - Observers have taken over the world and now we're doing some sort of resistance fighter thing.What do you do when a group of people you love go out and join some cult that makes no sense?  That's what season 5 was to me.  I didn't sign on for the whole sneaking around, trying to get bits and pieces out of perma-yellow-jell-o.Didn't actually buy all of season 5, dropped out from lack of interest;  Did manage to see the series finale...  And my mind still boggles.They really, really need to have some sort of test / acquire some sort of license before an author can be allowed to use a quantum paradox to solve a series...spoilers........One observer (September;  I hadn't noticed it really, but all of the observers that had gone back in time to our time were named after months of the year?!?) has a &#34;son&#34;.  This son is so wonderful that if they punt the poor kid into the future, it's going to become obvious to the first observers that that will be the way to go, go with emotions... And they'll be okay and never come back in time to take over the world.  (Yeah, right, hard to twist my head around that far).Of course Walter winds up going into the future with the kid, so Walter gets written out of history...  Well, sort ofBut...  No Walter, no Peter, No Peter, well, no anything.... world should in theory be fine and the way they write it the universe is supposed to be quasi-intelligent enough to figure this thing out (not me though).And if we assume that Peter does exist, the only reason he got together with Olivia was that Olivia went after him in season 1 to be a control for Walter....  Again, why would they meet, and how would they bump uglies and make a little girl?And the cow... Nothing was said of the cow?!?  Is it alive, did it evaporate?All in all a very disappointing ending.Credit to the actors, they portrayed their characters well and you became invested in them over the years....  But I think I'll remember Fringe as only having four seasons"
B009JARQ3G Great show.  JJ Abrams does it again!  I don't want to put in any spoilers, but they show really evolves over the 5 going from XFiles-like in the beginning to something completely different at the end.  A fun ride."
B009JARQ3G I've liked this from the beginning and am on my last episode in the fifth season. I am sorry it is no longer on the air."
B009JARQ3G The Fringe team, after investigating numerous paranormal crimes, discovering and traveling to an alternate universe and saving the world many times is now traveling in time to a future where the Observers have taken over the world for a purpose as yet unknown. The Fringe team has been seperated for over two decades frozen in amber and unaware of what is happening in the world. Olivia and Peter's daughter was raised as an orphan in this totalitarian new world where humans are little better than slaves. T
B009JARQ3G I really like this entire series so I was not let down in this fifth season.The surprises kept coming and the original team appearing again was amazingGot to see more if more are on the way"
B009JARQ3G This season starts with more questions than answers and it starts a bit slow and at least two episodes in the show i would say are pure filler however the rest are amazing since u can see that the human losses are taking there toll on our heroes. Still the ending leaves you with a sense that there is hope even in our darkest hours if we are strong and brave enough to find it."
B009JARQ3G The series was alright.  Some parts of last season seemed a bit rushed, and put in as a an after thought.  Plays with time travel, but not in any kind of way that will impress you."
B009JARQ3G Thoroughly enjoyed the 5th season as much as Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 but hated to know it all ends here.  Each episode is unique but frequently ties to events that occurred in past episodes.  The content is ever changing and keeps you on your toes.  You always look forward to the next episode and despite all dramatic events the series ends on a happy note."
B009JARQ3G There's not a lot to say since we are just three episodes into the fifth (and last) season of The Fringe. However, the series has never failed to satisfy. Having to wrap up story lines with the impending demise of the series may mean that early fifth season episodes are a bit enigmatib, but I'm sticking with the season and the storyline, confident that all will be revealed and we have some excellent surprises in store."
B009JARQ3G Fringe is such a great show. It always keep me guessing and being a detective (sci-fi) show with a little comedy too is great!"
B009JARQ3G This Ep was slow for action but filled story line requirements of materialsfor getting rid of the Observers. The rocks recovered had a price of life butstill unknown how they fit in.The actors did a good job but episode kind of draggedon with little learned about how we get to the final."
B009JARQ3G The whole series is great providing you ARE PREPARED TYO THINK CAREFULLY OTHERWISE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ALL THE PLOT TWISTS"
B009JARQ3G I chose a 5 rating because it was action packed with a Science Fiction Plot, the character Walter Bishop makes the Show exciting, you never know what Walter will do, the people called the &#34;Observers&#34; are people that can travel through time, and read minds, it is an exciting Science fiction show that is not to far fetched as compared to Science fantasy. The show also raises issues about ethics and human belief."
B009JARQ3G The interaction between characters, their on-screen chemistry, and the well-written plot lines make this show very enjoyable!  I highly recommend it!"
B009JARQ3G To me, this episode seems to take everything wrong with Fringe and pack it into one, plodding, tedious and at times, deeply annoying script.  Walter Bishop is at his most annoying and boring.  Peter and Olivia are weak and ineffective. The big reveal takes so long and, really, in the end, so little is revealed, you just want it to be over.  With respect to Walter Bishop's acid trip?  Trust me, there is nothing more boring than someone else's acid trip. Walter's acid trip is no exception. I think Disney should sue them for using a very recognizably disneyesque animated fairy. And then there's the Monte Python animation sequence.Aimless, drawn out plot developments. Everything that usually makes a Fringe episode exciting or interesting is eliminated. It's claustrophobic. Absolutely minimal forward plot movement. Forgettable dialogue. No suspense.  One scene of pointless and unconvincing violence. Utter absence of interesting supportive characters. Rehash upon rehash. No new ideas - zero. Utter lack of wit or humor. And on and on. And the director seems to take delight in sapping whatever life there is in this sorry script with excruciatingly slow pacing.  Everything that can be wrong with a TV episode is wrong with this one. It's enough to make you dread the next episode.  Right now, it looks like the season is going nowhere.  Or the show's creators have no idea what to do with the plot and don't really seem to care."
B009JARQ3G This was a pretty good ending to the series.  I don't want to say why it was not the greatest ending for me because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  It's definitely worth the wait."
B009JARQ3G love this show and have collected each season. sorry it had to end and all fans should add this final season to their collection"
B009JARQ3G Whoa. What can I say? This is one of those plots that just plain blows your mind! It killed me.Some here complain about the poor streaming. I can only say that it probably has nothing to do with Amazon and more to do with a person's bandwidth. We live out in the rurals and sometimes our internet is crappy, and to watch a movie or a TV episode and have it start and stop a dozen times, is just too much. So, we now start a show and then pause it for 15 minutes to allow it to buffer. After that, it's smooth sailing. I figure, what the heck, so it takes an hour to watch the episode this way, but it would if we were watching it straight from the TV, but we would have to suffer through or fast forward through the commercials. This is better. You just have to find a way to work with the system or beat it at it's own game."
B009JARQ3G I still enjoyed the 5th season but the ending sucked.The story was just not as believable somehow, I love SF but the writing changed in the last season."
B009JARQ3G I wrote one review on this show after 3 seasons a bit disappointed at how they sort of wasted the first half of season 3.  But after seeing the entire show I have to recant and applaud the best science fiction show I've seen on television.  Written to an actual conclusion of the story being told is rare in this genre due to so many shows simply having their budgets cut and the show end because it is not renewed.  Thankfully this show ended each season with a bang and the final season with the ultimate bang satisfying the many angles of the plot in a way that was both encouraging and emotionally satisfying in terms of our ties to the main characters.  I applaud the writing for evolving the underlying story to change the roles of the different universes/continuum's from foe to ally and then introduce the bigger threat in a way that still allowed them to bring closure to the other world characters and end on a positive note in terms of the big picture of the future.  I felt at a loss when it was over, but my only hope is more shows of such quality could be made to provide the level of entertainment and engagement that Fringe did in the future.  With the real world developments pushing into what was science fiction only decades ago it is hard to envision this genre not growing as what was just imagination becomes real and the &#34;fringe&#34; technology not so much a fantasy as a question of what the big developments are that lay ahead in our near future..  3D printing could become Star Trek's replicators, laughable 30 years ago, a real development in 2014.  My final note is the hope that the entertainment industry sees the value in producing quality Science Fiction that blends the fascinating developments of the near future with the many possibilities of where that could take us as a society, as a race, and keep backing new shows like Continuum and Defiance etc., and while your at it keep on streaming to bring a quick end to the cable industry!!!"
B009JARQ3G LOVE this show. Sad to see it end. The whole season is excellent, but I only buy a show here and there, because my AT&T DVR goes to hell and I have to get caught up intermittently."
B009JARQ3G The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I have not seen the last 2 episodes but I am sure the rating will be a 5 star once I have seen them. The series ended too soon for me. Would be cool if the 5 main stars could have a spin off where they work independantly of the Government."
B009JARQ3G Great writing, interesting characters, evolving plot lines, plain and simply enjoyable.  I wish there were more shows like this being created. Sorry to see it leave."
B009JARQ3G This show turned out to be quite an entertaining show. Loved the characters and it wound up with a good ending too!"
B009JARQ3G By far, the best finale ever. I love how they tied in all the other episodes from the whole series into the ending. I don't think I've ever been so pleased by the end of a tv series and I love how this series never got &#34;old.&#34;Great cast and characters, great storyline. I highly recommend this whole series."
B009JARQ3G Really this entire series was all about what holds a family together. In this case a lot of crazy happenings, time travel, alternate universes, alternate versions of the same people, and a future of humorless clones with super powers.And the plucky humans figure out what to do!What's not to like?"
B009JARQ3G I have really been enjoying rewatching the final season of Fringe.  I had been wanting to see it again and was delighted to see it on amazon."
B009JARQ3G We all love a good story where the subjects live happily ever after.  Walter ended up just where he belonged."
B009JARQ3G Season 5 is almost like a spin-off series from the original 4 seasons with most of the same actors.  Does it work?  It does indeed! In this final season, the plot changes...the Observers are no longer the benevolent watchers, but malevolent overlords and our heros aren't concerned about a parallel universe but about saving our own, albeit in the future. But let's face it, we love it so because we love the characters"
B009JARQ3G The seasons kept getting better and better, and Season 5 was no exception. The characters were endearing and entertaining as well. I was very sorry to see the series come to an end."
B009JARQ3G This is one of my favorite series, I'm so sorry it's over. Well done, not cheesy. Fine acting, good story lines. Some humor thrown in with Walter, he's awesome. Really got personal with the characters and the story, a sign of a well made series. Hope for some sort of sequel in the future."
B009JARQ3G I truly enjoyed the entire 5 seasons. Great family scifi adventure. I watched it as a Prime member so it was always available to me and I was able to view all of the seasons in sequence."
B009JARQ3G It's a great show, but I REALLY didn't like when they did away with Etta (Liv and Peter's daughter). That single thing really bummed me out, and well, even though they kind of make it better by the end, it's still not the same. Overall...GREAT acting! the best! And great writing (except for the daughter thing). I'd recommend it."
B009JARQ3G My wife and I got hooked on Fringe years ago and loved it until the end.  The plot got a little bit wacky in the final season (but, hey, it's &#34;Fringe&#34; what do you expect?). We enjoyed all the characters and the plot.  If you liked X-Files or generally enjoy SciFi, you'll greatly enjoy this series."
B009JARQ3G I'm sorry to see this show go off the air!!!  This has been one of the most exciting series I've seen in a while."
B009JARQ3G This is a real think outside the box show. Science fiction at it's finest (or is it fiction) hummm! I avoided watching this show for a couple of seasons. Then purchased the first season from Amazon and I was hooked. It is a weird show which I think makes it all the better! ;-)"
B009JARQ3G Once you start the series you won't want to stop.  It is great that this last season was done so we weren't left hanging."
B009JARQ3G The fifth and final season of one of my favorite shows, &#34;Fringe&#34;. This season finds our team in 2036, trying to overthrow the Observers who have taken over our planet. 13 episodes with extras that include &#34;A farewell to Fringe&#34; - Reflections from JJ Abrams, JH Wyman and cast, episode commentary, gag reel, and unaired scenes.We have all the Fringe seasons on blu ray, even though it is readily available on Netflix and Amazon digitally. Why? Because it is important to me - I loved this show and faithfully watched it every night that it was on, from the beginning to the end. Sure, like all of JJ's shows it wandered off here and there, but the cast and the characters they played, kept it real, kept it entertaining, kept me involved. Walter, Olivia, Peter, Astro...Astrid, Nina, and yes, William Bell, are some of the most creative, well written characters to ever grace television.If you have ever watched this show and lost interest, come back. You won't be disappointed."
B009JARQ3G Imaginative writing, good story lines, somewhat credible acting, and good production values.  Once you get started with this story, be prepared to follow it through all of the seasons."
B009JARQ3G Only too sad it ended.  Was quite dissapointed with the ending as well.  The show started pretty strong and seriously dwindled towards the end.  Still one of the best shows out there"
B009JARQ3G Season 5 answers alot of questions, but leaves alot.  The series took a turn instead of investigating strange phenomena, to fighting against oppression (resistance is not futile).  A turning towards family and looking to finding the strength we find in each other and others to fight to exist and to ensure love triumphs over the evil observers."
B009JARQ3G I don't particularly care for this season and the *SPOILER ALERT* the observers taking over... I like the old storyline better"
B009JARQ3G And this show has it all, sci-fi, quantum physics and love. Brilliant and always a wild ride. I wish it had gone on for more seasons."
B009JARQ3G I am glad they wrapped up the observers but paying for this season kind of hurt. The 4th season was the best."
B009JARQ3G I love the fringe series, but this 5th/final season was the worst.  The DVD design/quality/ execution was fantastic, but the content is just not up to par.  I knew this before purchase, but i wanted the collection.  The series is on Netflix till the end of 2014 (from what i understand) so buy now before the price goes up.  Also, walmart and best buy are no longe carrying the UV version of Fringe, so i would recommend purchasing through Amazon."
B009JARQ3G I loved this show when it first came out. As soon as we hit the season where there are multiple of all characters I lost interest. Simply because I couldn't keep up with who was who from which time. I have seen a few of the newer ones & am glad to see that multiple worlds may be a thing of the past. Anyhow..I still give it 5 stars because it deserves them, it's not their fault I can't keep track."
B009JARQ3G How sad. They turned Fringe into a dull invader story. Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia, Walter, and Peter to make some incredible discovery. Walter is no longer the lovable damaged person he was, and that was 80% of the draw of the series. I had pre-purchased a season pass but I am now canceling it. For me the series is already over."
B009JARQ3G This was a great season. I binge watched multiple episodes at a time. I have really enjoyed this series and the series' final season did not disappoint."
B009JARQ3G The characters are funny and yet serious when stuff comes up. I like the idea of 2 universes. It seems possible but maybe some of it was not believable. If you like time travel and duel universe situations this is the show for you. I enjoyed it."
B009JARQ3G Which means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: \"you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment\" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me,  as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful shows (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years). So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more genero
B009JARQ3G Again with the sci-fi.  This one was an interesting take on doppelgangers and alternate worlds. I would have watch more seasons if they had been available."
B009JARQ3G It seemed a bit cheesey about first but by the end of the first season I was hooked on what they would discover next and if Peter would finally get his girl :) Great show..."
B009JARQ3G Great cast writing and the stories are unique.  You can't get much better than this.  The fact that the show was on five years and never let its quality drop is outstanding.  I'll miss it"
B009JARQ3G After being frozen in amber for 21 years, the Fringe team discovers that they are folk heroes - recorded in the future version of dime novels, and in crystal technology. The treasure hunt is on for six videotapes Walter created and hid in various places, that detail the plan to eradicate the Observers from earth, and restore our planet to an environmentally safe place to live. While Astrid stays behind in the lab trying to unsnarl tape number three (the first one found), and discover what Walter was looking for, the Bishop family ventures into the wilds of Pennsylvania. Once they reach the designated coodinates they find a hidden group of natives recording the earth's history since the Observers took over. The group is infected with a bark like fungus due to the Observers changing the atmosphere (more carbon monoxide so they can breathe better), and the Bishop family shows early signs of infection soon after they arrive. Once Astrid identifies the prize the team is after, it is a race against time before the Observers track down the hidden camp and the Fringe team. Brilliant character actor Paul McGillion (Stargate Atlantis/Sanctuary) turns in a tender and sweet performance as the father of a young boy in the camp and the lead recordist.FYI - If you are looking for Nina and Broyles - currently they are only scheduled to appear in episodes 5.6 and 5.13."
B009JARQ3G This series deals with universal and contemporary themes (genocide, genetic experimentation, etc.), which makes it rise above the usual thriller/sci-fi dramas.  These are excellent stories relying on outstanding performances by a group of 4 protagonists.  The plot relies on Olivia Dunham, FBI agent working on special assignment to investigate a series of &#34;abnormal&#34; incidents perpetrated by breaks in space and time.  It's not your usual sci-fi and plots out more like a good thriller because the character development is not overshadowed by special effects and story-lines.  Watch this from the first season--you won't want to miss the nuances."
B009JARQ3G I have loved the Fringe series.  It was very creative and exciting to watch--very macabre at times.  I am happy the final conflict was against beings rather than an alternate universe.  I think the series ended nicely--didn't stretch the limits of its viewers patience, and was exciting enough to keep interest.  You definitely must be a sci fi fantasy fan to like it."
B009JARQ3G When Fringe first came out I was obsessed with it, LOVED the show --- but this season has me missing it from time to time --- I just don't like where the writers have taken it ..."
B009JARQ3G A show, not unlike X-Files, but with genuine terror felt by the characters and realistic responses by the capable actors to the endless (and cool) strange plot features. Elements and characters that were introdued early were brought back around in a highly imaginative and compelling manner. The relatinships of the characters were developed in a completely believable fashion so as to make the viewer care about the characters and the fate of their relationships. One of the most nice crafted, executed and ended television series I've seen - thanks to the makers and performers, you left this viewer satified."
B009JARQ3G Although season 5 was disappointing, I still give it 3 stars for it's quality. I just can't rate this show low, but I'm saddened that they gave up on the story line so quickly. It's still good, just should have gone for at least 2 more seasons."
B009JARQ3G I have all the season's now of Fringe I can tell you if you like the strange and weird you will love this serious my only sorrow is that it stopped at 5 seasons."
B009JARQ3G Entertainment packed with the unimaginable. Extraordinary concepts in the Sci Fi range, propelling you into the futureI. Truly enjoyable series to the end."
B009JARQ3G I was happy that they summed up everything in the end and I'm sooo happy that I bought Amazon Prime because I forgot some of the characters and I could go back to review what I needed to know"
B009JARQ3G Great characters, great plot lines!  Given that the season / series was ending - enjoyed the wrap-up.  The writers rushed a threads of the story to complete the ending, but well worth the time."
B009JARQ3G Fantastic Series. Each episode is amazing and thought-provoking. I could watch this episode again and again! The characters jump out of the screen and into your life and the story lines remain in your mind for days!"
B009JARQ3G Enjoyed the whole run of the series. Good ending to the shows. I really enjoyed the acting and the stories."
B009JARQ3G I didn't watch this show on television. I started watching on Amazon Prime and then ended up buying the final season.Thank God it ended because I was a complete junkie. This was the greatest Sci-Fi series I've ever seen,  I am not a huge Sci-Fi fan, but this show was amazing.If you are like me, part of the problem--someone who didn't boost the ratings while the show could be saved--then at least don't be foolish a second time and miss out on this very entertaining show."
B009JARQ3G ...but a darned good placebo for those of us still suffering withdrawal pains.  The show is funny, well written and featured mind bending cases and sci-fi.  Can't help but wonder how Mulder and Walter would get along."
B009JARQ3G I hated for this series to end as I enjoy syfy and I thought there were some wonderful characters in this.  Over the five seasons there were a few missteps on the continuity, but nothing that made me want to stop watching.  Very well written and imaginative."
B009JARQ3G In 40 years of viewing TV Sci-Fi, Fringe is way, way above all the others in writing, plot, suspence, drama and quality of actors. As far as I know, it is the only Sci-Fi that deals with behaviorial sciences and the relational psychologies between parents and children.  Unlike other reviewers, I believe the ending two seasons are much better developed from a psychological perspective than Seasons 1 to 3.  The concept of evil changes, there are no true heros and villians per se in the concluding seasons, not to mention the writers which in my opinion are extraordinary excellent, always lead the audience down one path and then at the last minute something unexpected happens.  It reminds of the legendary Hitchcock mysteries, and mystery more so than sci-fi horror forms the center of the 5th Season.  I found myself stuck to viewing one episode afer another because I could not wait to find out what happens next. Sorry to see the show go away but having Fringe conclude as a superior Sci Fi series is so much better than to have the show continue so long that it loses the WOW factor."
B009JARQ3G I love this show if you like the syfi stuff this is a must they explore eveything and even things that you dont think of they do its great"
B009JARQ3G Sadly this is the end of one of the best sci fi shows tv has ever had. It wasn't about monsters as much as about ideas and family. This episode is no different. This show is for those who want intelligent stories and you get that here. As the recordists are trying to perserve history by recorning it. But should they start making it?  You will find out in this episode. Fringe is out on the edges of tv still, because it dared to stick to it's guns and not become a simple show that was a space opera. I love thta type of sci fi but this type is like the best of sci fi writing , deep and thought provoking."
B009JARQ3G Battle fatigue has set in. Storyline good but not up to standards of previous seasons. Still, much better tie up than other jj Abrams series. Superb acting. Won't miss fringe story but will surely miss the characters"
B009JARQ3G Season 5 (the final season) moved at a rapid pace.  They had to move a little more quickly than they had hoped, I believe, but the producers/directors/actors did a fine job moving the series along in a believable manner.This was a good science fiction series that even if you tried to get into Lost and failed, I think you might like this.  It has a feeling similar to the X-Files but maybe a little darker at times like Millennium but gives you the feeling like you are in on &#34;the secret&#34; the entire time.  Kind of cool."
B009JARQ3G My husband and I loved this show and how it ended. The action, drama, and the plot kept you going and wanting more."
B009JARQ3G If you have watched Fringe from the first season forward you know they teased the Observer takeover/war from the beginning.  This season told that story, and ended the series.  I think they were able to do both reasonably well.  My one real gripe....(THE NEXT FEW SENTENCES WILL CONTAIN SEASON 4 SPOILERS)....were that they did not bridge seasons 4 and 5 enough.  This is likely due to the fact that they were only given 13 episodes to finish off the series.  They completely abandoned the William Bell universe creation arc from season 4, trying to somewhat bridge the gap by exposition in the middle of season 5.  They also dumped the alternate universe storyline except for one visit during season 5.  Had they had the full 22-24 episodes to work with then some of that may have been fleshed out a little.Like in former seasons this season had a \"story of the week\" aspect, but they all tied in to the backdrop of the season storyline.  Each episode uncovered another aspect of Walter's plan to defeat the Observers.  Within that there was still development of the individual characters.  Lance Reddick and Blair Brown went from being series regulars to recurring in this season, so we only got to see Nina and Broyles on a limited basis.  Even so, they did play integral parts in the story.Like the other Blu Ray releases, the picture and sound is very good.  There are also a few good features as extras that are retrospectives both on the season and the series.  While the season does feel rushed because it was truncated, I think it does an good job wrapping up the series, and ties most of the loose ends from other seasons.  It is definitely a show that will not appeal to everyone, and even fans of the show have different opinions of the quality from season 1 to season 5.  I do think a show like this probably only had a shelf life of 4-5 seasons before it was going to start getting stale and just too unbelievable, so I think it ended at the right time.  If you are a fan of the genre, then it is work checking out."
B009JARQ3G After a pretty tough-to-get-through first half of season 1, Fringe quickly became my favorite show and I ate up every episode in under two months, which is saying a lot for someone who was wrapping up graduate school.  Now that I'm done, so is the show unfortunately.  While I've noticed a lot of bitching and blaming about the show ending, I'll just say how happy I am that there's going to be an end.  Shows like this that don't get the opportunity for closure are terrible wastes and if that had been done to Fringe I would have been writing some angry fan mail to the abyss known as Fox customer care.  So, while this season feels rushed and I'm desperately sad to see it go, I'm not going to complain.  Instead, I'm going to finish it out, then do my best to introduce the show to as many people as I can so as to spread the joy, and give myself an excuse to start it over again."
B009JARQ3G One of the best shows around. Thoughtful and intelligent. Stretches the imagination in a believable way. Wish there were more shows like this!"
B009JARQ3G This is a lil different but not much. Something to watch to pass the time with other than that its another SciFi movie"
B009JARQ3G I am a massive fan of the Fringe series, but this season was a let down. I understand they tried to wrap everything up as they knew it was the final season, but it didn't wrap everything (or anything) up. The idea was great, I loved the premise, but it left too many questions unanswered for me - how can any of the Fringe events occur if the observers are prevented from being created? How can an observer pull Peter and Walter from the river if Walter stops them from being created??? How, I ask you??? How????So basically, while the series is exciting, it doesn't make sense. If you can overlook that (which I certainly did in the end), then you will like this season."
B009JARQ3G The final Season of Fringe is a true journey of emotion, passion, and pure fighting spirit as the Original Fringe Team begins their Final Battle against the Observers.Sacrifice comes hard to the Bishops and Olivia, in more ways than one.In the end, it is love for a child that brings the series to an end in an Explosive, and Heart-wrenching finale, that truly let Fringe finish on it's own terms.The series, while a true Sci-fi show, is more of a story about family, and love."
B009JARQ3G first of all if you have come this far you know what a wonderful experience fringe has been for all of us season five is more of the same"
B009JARQ3G This is a wonderful and engrossing show.  While I did struggle at times to suspend my disbelief, the writing, acting and directing make this one of my all time favorites."
B009JARQ3G Definitely a must have for the Fringe fan.  Sadly, the storyline had nowhere to go after Season 4, although Season 5 was appropriate and had some real surprises."
B009JARQ3G I loved this series and now that I have it all I can only wish there was more of it.  But the old saying goes &#34;always leave them laughing&#34; definitely applies here.  Glad to have 5 years of &#34;Fringe&#34;."
B009JARQ3G This is one of the \"better\" series I have EVER seen on television.  I just watched the last episode and I'm sorry there aren't going to be more.  Excellent acting."
B009JARQ3G I really got hooked on this series. I watched it one show after the next on Prime Time TV. It had a great balance of originality, humor and suspense. The actors did a great job of playing the duel roles; someone did an impressive job figuring out how to keep the audience alerted to location changes without disruptive dialogue added only for that purpose. I guess the only show anything like it was X-Files and this show is much funnier with great characters evolving.. You really should start watching the full series because the story develops as it progresses"
B009JARQ3G One of the best series on TV in a long time. Only wish that they would produce more SiFi like this show."
B009JARQ3G I Love the plot line and it had me on the edge of my seat what a ride. ya i love it"
B009JARQ3G Still the most disorienting, playful, thought-provoking, visually-interesting sf on television.  And Walter is, as ever, a delight.  Eager to see how it all wraps up."
B009JARQ3G I will miss Fringe -- the final season has been great!  That's all that I have to say -- enjoyable"
B009JARQ3G After watching all 5 seasons in a row all I can say to all involved is Thanks for the ride. This is one of the best shows that ever hit tv. Great stories interesting characters and 5 seasons worth to treasure. The show's last season is a great way to end the show. I really believe that next to Battlestar Galactica that Fringe also hit new highs in the sci fi genre. As always the best shows havew the best drama. Well done  tv at it's best."
B009JARQ3G I'm so sad this show is going by-by.  This is the last season.  Current season is centered around a future world where dictators dominate and the 'watchers' are in control.  They are emotionless creatures who are able to read thoughts so there are no secrets, unless you learn how to block them.  The 'watchers' are also able to predict future events so they are able to maintain control.  Another show with a well cast group of actors.  Thoroughly enjoyable show.  Well rounded characters.  Highly recommended."
B009JARQ3G The wife and I have enjoyed Fringe for the most part. I think they got a little lost in seasons 3-4, but we enjoyed season 5. If you like sci-fi, Fringe is worth watching."
B009JARQ3G Fringe wa by far my favorite TV series.  I truly enjoyed it!  I hope they continue with another season!!! It was a great tv series."
B009JARQ3G Almost physics and a believable love story make this fun to watch. Series gets progressively better as seasons move forward."
B009JARQ3G Shadowed in well written science fiction drama Fringe pushes the envelope keeping you glued and wanting more. If you're not yet a fan you will be. Great entertainment, acting and plot, you won't be disappointed."
B009JARQ3G After four seasons of twists and turns, the final season was a bit of a let down. I know that Hollywood needs a happy ending, but they could have done a less predictable and more interesting job of getting there."
B009JARQ3G Satisfying and uplifting without being too cloying. If you have followed Fringe from the start then you must see the conclusion - learn the backstory to the Observers! Settle back and enjoy the ride, and bid farewell to a fine show, well written and superbly acted throughout."
B009JARQ3G This show is excellent, the characters are excellent actors.  With the exception of Joshua Jackson, however, even his chops start to develop through the show.  I even feel a sense of loss after completing all five of the seasons, because the show is THAT good.  Its the little engine that could.  The guy who plays Walter is an excellent actor.  As is Anna Torv. Both of them riveting."
B009JARQ3G Too bad; the quirky and smart characters turned into familiar series cliches, action, predictability. All, so redundant that I have to struggle to make the 20-word quota."
B009JARQ3G The last and final season was the best as it showed after all the things that went wrong and went right finally ended with this season and I enjoyed it very much."
B009JARQ3G After five seasons of watching this wonderful show, I was pleased to see how theyended the story. It was absolutely moving and touching."
B009JARQ3G I totally loved this show in the first two seasons... then I sloughed through BORING season 3... got better in season 4, and I started dreading the end of the show this season.  The season started out a little boring, but it got better quickly.  I put off watching the last 2 episodes because I was dreading the fact that it was going to be over.  I waited so long that I was able to watch the last 2 episodes back-to-back, fortunately!  The 2nd to last ep. was amazing, and the last one started out that way, too. But - and I won't give anything away, it ended VERY badly.  Too many shows end badly, but generally it's because they didn't know they were going to end.  THIS show knew it was ending, and they could have done a much better job of it for sure.  IMHO, the last episode ruined the show for me.  It was so disappointing that now I don't even care that the show ended, and that is just sad.  It's better for shows to go out on a high note so that people will miss the show, not be happy it's over.  Shoot."
B009JARQ3G Ok, the first time around, the network kept changing the air time and story line that seem to warp and transform from original story line got me to stop watching.  Now that I'm able to watch the whole series back to back, I enjoyed it better.Even with odd turn of events with observer becoming &#34;overseers&#34;, It was enjoyable.  But the final episodes seemed a little flat to me. I guess it's because I knew it was final episodes and they have to correct all the wrong and put it back in place.It was an obvious plot...Overall, despite weak ending, I enjoyed the series."
B009JARQ3G I so loved this great series and will miss the characters.  I wish they'd gone on and on but do watch it.  I thought was wonderful!"
B009JARQ3G I just loved this show - it was so different and original and the characters were so engaging, the actors portraying them so compelling. I especially loved John Noble's portrayal of the fragile, damaged and brilliant Dr. Walter Bishop. I was sad to see it end - but they did a great job with that ending. Bon voyage, Fringe, and thanks for all the wonderful, amazing, touching, tense and just enjoyable episodes in the 5 year run."
B009JARQ3G I have to say that few shows, if any, can touch you on so many levels as Fringe does. Intellectually, emotionally, spiritually and even comically and this season Fringe  has been all that and in this episode you go on a magical mystical emotional ride.Fringe has continually presented the movement of consciousnesses expansion in the way it was originally intended, well before the military got involved, as furthering the evolutionary intellecual development of human consciousness.To reach our greater potential.That being said Walter uses this tool as way to see beyond his on ego laced and emotional limitations. There are reason that is so and they are revealed in this episode.The name \" Black blotter\" is revealing as those in the known, know LSD was more popularly known as \"white blotter\" back in the day.Not that Walter has a bad trip but once again he re-experiences an abundance of memories of his past ego statistical self in ways that are  both comical at times but also haunting.Its clear he had an affair with his female nemesis and she is his guide through this trip.There are some  great surprises to and not to give it all away but if you are  fan of Monty Python you will enjoy one sequence.There are also stronger religious  symbolism in this episode as well. Is this sexy blonde scientist a Mary Madeline figure?  Dr.Carol Warren is a believer in Christ and wears a  gold cross but also reveals some strong moral and scientific arguments against Walter's past pursuits.She argues with him quoting Oppenheimer.She also represents a sexual passion that is also part of Walter past.The episode ends with  maybe the most strongest religious symbolism as the boy at the end of Donald's radio transmission signal is a boy named Michael. Possibly in reference to Archangel Michael.As the world is in the time of end.\"time of the End\" when there will be \"distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations\" and that\"At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise.\"We will see."
B009JARQ3G I thought I'd go through withdrawls when I finished watching Lost but this show is just as good, what a find.From the same people who addicted us all to Lost, this show is so satisfying on so many levels.All about Fringe Science, alternate universes and the creepy &#34;observers&#34; who watch events in our world.The acting is great, the story and plot so complex - it's a joy to be savored.Watch this show from season one, otherwise you will not be able to follow what is going on.I'm just sorry that I reached the end. Would love to hear about a season six."
B009JARQ3G So everything finally comes together. It's great to see storylines from Season 1 being used during this season. And it wraps things up nicely."
B009JARQ3G Great show, wish it had a longer run.  Especially since I didn't even know about it unit the end of the final season.  This type of quality writing and acting, in a Sci-Fi series, is one of the best I've had the pleasure of watching."
B009JARQ3G If you've never watched Fringe or have only seen bits & pieces but, you also call yourself a Sci-Fi fan...you truly do love everything that is science fiction AND..., if you've enjoyed television shows such as the X-Files.... then, give Fringe a try! Watch at least 3 or 4 episodes of the first Series. I have no doubt, you'll enjoy it, & quite possibly, become hooked as well. No. I do believe you'll love it & come to regret;just as so many others, including myself, that you had discovered Fringe just a little too late. I kicked myself for learning I'd found this awesome show literally just DAYS after their announcement that it was being cancelled due to it not having a large enough following. How could I have known?But, the positive here is... YOU have the awesome privilege of getting to watch one show after another without needing to WAIT for what will happen next! You don't need to wait weeks or even two or three months; an entire season for the new Fall Line-Up of Primetime television shows to reveal what happens to your favorite characters that you've been following week to week! No \" ...to be continued.\" at the end of the seasons final episode to drive you absolutely mad! lol All you need to do is stream the next episode right here! :DSo many of us had waited patiently for the last final 13 weeks for each episode to finally air. Right up until the last 2 hour finale. As for me? It was most definitely worth the wait! Fringe, in my opinion, is quite possibly; the BEST Science Fiction Series ever played on television! Certain actors & (actresses) should have received awards for their work in Fringe but even I, myself, had only recently discovered Fringe. Therefore, I can't be upset if others have too.Perhaps one day, the cast from Fringe will be asked to RETURN? Oh, what great television that would make! I can almost pictures how that first episode would look like!But, anyway... for those of you who've never watched Fringe, do yourself the favor. 3 episodes is all you need...I believe that's all it'll take for you to become a \"FringeFanatic\" & you'll have watched all 5 seasons in 3 days...non-stop! :PEnjoy! :-)"
B009JARQ3G I love all of the Fringe Seasons.  I didn't want it to end!  Great Syfy adventures! Recommend it to any SyFy addict!"
B009JARQ3G Best show in some time to hit the airwaves. I just wish they had continued this for another ten seasons."
B009JARQ3G This is one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time.  The character development is very very good.  It makes you feel connected to the action.  I am sooo sad it's over!"
B009JARQ3G This show is my favorite sci-fi show. This is very well acted and few of the concepts are eye opener."
B009JARQ3G It all comes together in the fifth series....  We were really bummed out when the show ended, it was probably one of the best shows on Television.Imaginative story line, great characters, and excellent actors tied together into a well thought-out story.Please bring it back!!!"
B009JARQ3G Loved the Fringe series, unfortunetly the last season has to may musical interludes, and dramatic longing stares which slowed the pace, miminal science. But you have to watch it to see how it all ends."
B009JARQ3G I have been dreading the end of Fringe. So much more than just a SciFi show. What I enjoyed the most was watching the relationship between Walter and Peter grow. This show did a lot of things right, especially taking the time for the little things. Strong character and relationship development is one of the shows biggest attractions and a trademark of JJ Abrams."
B009JARQ3G Fans of \"Fringe\" saw the main storyline wrapped up in season four but there were still numerous loose ends and the fifth season gave showrunner Josh Wyman the chance to tie those up(for the most part). Given a shorter season (the magic 100 episodes reached for syndication with the 13 for season five) and a smaller budget, the fifth season examined many of the themes from the prior seasons and closed things off in an uneven but largely satisfying conclusion.SPOILERS:Season five functions almost as a reboot for the series in many respects as it takes place 21 years from 2015. The Fringe team (Olivia, Peter, Walter and Astrid) were ambered and are revived by their daughter to help fight The Observers. It seems that they weren't as beign as believed; September and his 11 other cohorts were scouting our time for an invasion from their time as their world has been so badly depleted of resources, it is dying.The Fringe team must put together the pieces of a puzzle existing in Walter's brain as he came up with a plan to defeat The Observers but can't recall it due to an interrogation that damages his memory.END OF SPOILERS:The fifth season for \"Fringe\" was a bit uneven with episodes that felt like filler episodes but the best ones hold their own with some of the best of seasons one through four. Although the production values weren't quite as strong for season five, the fifth season still had marvelous performances from the cast.Although there are numerous plot holes left by this season (I can't reveal them because to do so would provide too many spoilers), Wyman and his team of writers/directors do a good job of providing an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the show.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer that provides lots of detail (you can even see light acne on the face of one actor in one sequence). The cool look of the show is nicely captured on the blu-ray discs.The 5.1 lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice use of surround effects. We get subtitles in English, Spanish and French.The special features include a single commentary track for \"Black Blotter\" featuring writer/producer J.H. Wyman and editor Jon Dudkowski. Every season of \"Fringe\" had an unusual, experimental episode and this is the one. It's a terrific one particularly with its unusual salute to Terry Gilliam and Monty Python.\"A Farewell to Fringe\" features the cast, J.J. Abrams, J.H. Wyman and others in past and present interviews discussing the series. This runs about 20 minutes and is nicely complimented by the Comic Con panel on the series done just before season five premiered. It features the primary cast members (minus Blair Brown)discussing their favorite moments, the character development and answering a couple of questions posed by the audience.We also get a couple of deleted scenes as well as the gag reel all presented in HD. As a nice touch we also get a copy of the final script on the disc which you can read. It might have been nice incorporating it as an interactive feature with the final episode but I'm not complaining too much; Warner could have given usnothing in the way of special features.The three disc set also includes an episode guide and the package is housed in a cardboard slipcase.Although the final season was a bit short and some of the episodes were uneven, the final season was an emotionally satsifying one even if the show was quite a bit different from the preceding four."
B009JARQ3G I liked this whole series, except for the occasional stupid writing errors, or stupid barriers to the actin or stupid, sudden way-too-easy resolves, or how she can shoot anyone in the forehead from any position at any time, yet can get captured if someone says boo to her - just stupid writing creeping in. The actors are all top level performances, not too much over-the-top or unnecessary stiffness or quirky alien stuff - all very well performed. Of course the stupidest thing of all is that because they 'won', it all never happened - so why'd we watch? Think about it..."
B009JARQ3G I was not sure I was going to stick with it initially, but once the 2 dimension part came into play it was gripping. The first part seemed like a bunch of disconnected plots that the Fringe team had to solve. Over time, it became apparent that these were linked and it comes together several episodes into the story so don' give up if you are a SciFi junkie.The characters are interesting and compelling although the Doc can do some pretty good mental loop-d-loops on a frequent basis.I like the contrasting character and character interactions between the same people across the 2 dimensions."
B009JARQ3G For three seasons, \"Fringe\" was a sci-fi masterpiece worthy of any other other ever created in that genre.  Then, the network (in this case FOX) decided to cast it off to the \"fringes\" (pun intended) of their schedule, burying it on Friday nights and make the show creators sweat out renewal, severely affecting plot cohesiveness.  So, by the time this final truncated season got the O.K., it was clear that the show would never truly recapture the magic of earlier installments.  That being said, the show producers still managed to create a workable ending to such a high-concept show.  It just wasn't in the jaw-dropping format of the past.For a basic plot summary of the Fifth Season, this campaign sees the show shift into the future, where Peter (Joshua Jackson), Olivia (Anna Torv), and Walter (John Noble) are pulled out of yellow amber by none other than Peter & Olivia's daughter, Etta (Georgina Haig).  They discover a world in havoc and terror, caused by an Observer takeover.  However, Walter has a plan to set things right, requiring a number of different \"ingredients\" (compromising the bulk of the season's episodes) and help from old friends Astrid (Jasika Nicole), Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), and Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick).The obvious problem with this season is that because of FOX's tampering, the show oozed away all its most creative juices in a rollercoaster season four.  Without knowing whether or not a final renewal was imminent, the writers were practically held hostage, story-arc wise.  So, by the time word finally came down that a 13-episode send-off was a go, things had to be severely simplified.  Thus, a show that once dealt with some hefty, mind-bending topics was reduced to \"rebels vs Observers\" in terms of the main plotline.  In essence, it failed to distinguish itself from other general sci-fi fare currently on the airwaves.Yet, despite that glaring weakness, the Fifth Season still holds some meaning in the Fringe cannon for one main reason: the characters.  When all the lofty storytelling and mind-bending plots fall away, the strong characters that comprise this show still stand strong.  You'll keep watching because you want to see how they all end up.Simply put, the Fifth Season of \"Fringe\" is clearly in a different class (unfortunately a lower class) than the first three or maybe even four seasons of the show.  It is still interesting to watch because, at least for sci-fi \"big idea\" show fans right now, the pickings are extremely slim.  It just isn't the \"glory days\" of old."
B009JZSKRM as with most shows, the decline as begun... but it still has it's funny moments... i'll still watch the new season."
B009JZSKRM I love this show, it has got to be one of the most underrated cartoons for adults and kids alike out there.  This is probably their best season, they really hit their stride here.  I would recommend this for anyone you can't go wrong here."
B009JZSKRM geniunely entertaining, funny and charming. you get that these characters are real and that they care about each other.humor is great!"
B009JZSKRM ....though not quite. And excellent in it's own special way. I love the way it manages to be sweet in the family relations way, and yet biting at the same time. Excellent show!!!"
B009JZSKRM I enjoyed every episode. Very consistent with the characters. Definitely worth watching. I wish there wasn't a max number of words for these reviews."
B009JZSKRM Hey, guys, I love this show, but I'm PAYING for it so I won't have to watch your stupid ads. FOX, you've seriously screwed up, in this viewers opinion. Bad. Bad enough that I WILL NOT be spending money for this show again if it has ads."
B009JZSKRM Wow, Bob's Burgers is so much fun to watch. The characters and the voice actors are amazing. It makes me laugh harder than pretty much anything else on TV."
B009JZSKRM Due to the poor quality of programming these days, we decided to get rid of cable. One of the few drawbacks is not being able to watch Bob's Burgers. With Amazon instant video, we're able to still enjoy the escapades of our favorite Burger joint owner and family. Sometimes we think our family is going to end up just like Bob's!"
B009JZTOG8 This was purchased for a family member as a gift.They loved it and await the next season &#34;gift&#34; as they watch the series."
B009JZTOG8 Once Upon a Time has become the most original and moving fantasy on television, reinterpreting the old fairy tales yet remaining true to their message of hope, courage and grace under pressure. The residents of Storybrooke Maine are fairytale characters who have been enchanted and transported into our world with no memory of their lives in the Enchanted Forest. Emma Swann, daughter of Snow and Charming was sent away before the curse struck so she could fulfill her destiny of breaking the curse. The first season alternates between the present in Storyville and the past in the Enchanted Forest, retelling all of the tales that we love so much.In the second season, the curse is broken, but a new curse has taken its place, trapping the residents of Storyville, with their memories, but unable to leave. Snow and her daughter Emma are now trapped in the Enchanted Forest looking for a way back to Storyville and a way to break the curse. In this episode, Rumpelstiltskin and his past are under the microscope. Just how did Rumpel become the dark one and why did he trap the residents of Storyville again just as the curse of Regina was lifted. The answers may surprise you but they will always delight. A wonderful backstory for a classic villain. Captain Hook makes an appearance as well and we finally learn just how the crocodile got his hand.Watch Once Upon a Time, start with the first season and keep going as this reinvention of the classic tales is enchanting, well written, well acted and all of the production values are superb. In particular, the costumer and set designer must be having a field day of fun. Just wonderful."
B009JZTOG8 Love this series, the intermingling of fairy tale characters with their 'modern' selves continues to be clever. The fact that the characters are not always what we have grown up with invisioning makes it even better. The cast have sunk into their roles with gusto. Waiting for the next lot."
B009JZTOG8 great show... really neat to watch the story unfold..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
B009JZTOG8 Season 2 follows the interesting story lines of Season 1. Love it! I am already a fan of this series."
B009JZTOG8 Yes it's a bit silly and purely escapism, but this series offers fun and flights of imagination. What if those familiar fairy tale, mythological, and legendary characters were alive and living somewhere in Maine? This isn't great cinema, but many viewers will enjoy the what.if element of each episode."
B009JZTOG8 Probably Biased Rating...My biggest critique of the show is that it is slightly over feminine for my taste.  I'm not Mr Rambo, but I wish there were a bit more of a masculine element most of the time."
B009JZTOG8 I just love this tv show it takes you to a whole new world with magic and good vs evil."
B009JZTOG8 This is such a great show! We love the classic background that is incorporated into every day modern life! It is a very original storyline and very addicting!"
B009JZTOG8 A lot of people are saying this show got silly but I really like it. It has captain hook and mulan in it which most people see that as a story instead of a fairytale but I love the way it's intertwined. It's not as good as season one but still worth the watch to me."
B009JZTOG8 This show is fantastic! I am always amazed at what they do and how everything is so entwined. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us!"
B009JZTOG8 This little sleeper Once Upon a Time was such a surprise to me. I watched the pilot because I liked the actors. I fell in love with the series because they work so well together.Keep up the good work..."
B009JZTOG8 Ok, I have written a review of Season 1.  I was going to wait until next year for Season 2 to finish before writing another review of the show, but decided to go ahead and write an episode review for the time being.In any case, I really like what they're doing with the show.  On this episode, they left out Emma, Regina, and Snow.  Instead concentrating on the heart-breaking story of Rumplestiltskin, Belle, and Bale.  We learn why Rumple made the choices that he did, and honestly can even symphatize with him.  In his shoes, I might have made the same choices.  You should watch and decide!  As I have said many times, the very best stories are driven both by plot and by character.  This episode was a very good example of good writing.  Lots of drama, as well as a fair bit of action and some swashbuckling.  And, in my opinion, Robert Carlyle basically steals most of the scenes that he's on.  Great to see an actor of his stature on television.  After all, this is an actor who has played a James Bond villain in the past.The story flashes back to the \"past\", with the humble weaver, Rumplestiltskin, doing his best to hold on to his family.  His wife has lost respect for him.  Not only that, she is bored with her life and finds herself falling in love with a rogue ship captain.  Rumple pleads with her to stay, for Bale's sake.  But she finally makes the choice to run off with the captain.  Meanwhile, in the present, Belle runs off and wants to make a new life for herself.  Mr. Gold enlists the help of the town's acting law enforcement, David Nolan, to help find her.  The dwarves, led by Leroy, continues to search for fairy dust.  And Ruby joins David and Gold to look for Belle.  To add complication to an already tense situation for Rumplestiltskin, Cora the witch comes back and befriends Hook, the ship captain.This show is something to look forward to on Sunday evenings.  Highly recommended."
B009JZTOG8 I resisted watching this series because I never took the time to watch from the beginning!  I really think they do a good job with it- the characters are engaging and it creates nice plots and twists.  I have been pleasantly surprised- even shocked at how much I have enjoyed Season 1 and 2."
B009JZTOG8 I've followed this story line since the first episode.  The story is attention keeping, the character surprising, the acting is pretty dadgum good.  I am looking forward to seeing all the happily ever afters eventually."
B009JZTOG8 Wife loves it, and I'll admit, I'm watching it with her. Interesting take on the old (mostly) Disney fairy tales, but I would likely never have watched it were it not for the wife."
B009JZTOG8 Fun series, I like the plot. Interesting new twists, and great cast. My daughter really seems to enjoy it too."
B009JZTOG8 Season one was better.  It seems like the writers are getting desperate to find to angles and twists.  This show should have been a one hit wonder making us want more instead of wishing we hadn't bought the whole season!"
B009JZTOG8 This is not a show for everyone. If you like fairy tales with twist this would be a show for you. For me it captures my thoughts and makes me think."
B009JZTOG8 With the conclusion of season one, I had to admit I wondered exactly where this show could go. After all, the curse was lifted.And, the second season asks, \"Really? Was the curse truly lifted?\"Great stuff. I look forward to seeing where this roller coaster is headed.Road Trip"
B009JZTOG8 This fantasy drama features characters like Snow White and Rumplestiltskin. In this second season, the curse that landed the fairy tale characters in the &#34;real&#34; world with fake identities is broken, but they are not automatically returned to the Enchanted Forest. Now that they remember who they really are, they're faced with new problems. Each episode is rather compelling, if often melodramatic (even soap opera-like). Highly imaginative, often exciting, with some great performances (especially Robert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin)."
B009JZTOG8 I really really really hated this show to end. This was one the whole family enjoyed together. Wish there was more like this one."
B009JZTOG8 This show is one of my favorites of the last ten years. Few shows make me sorry when the episode ends. This is one of those shows. Each episode is so gripping for me. I love the way the characters and the plots unfold. It's magical."
B009JZTOG8 what a great show full of magic.. cannot wait until it's released on blu ray.. the first season looked great in high def.."
B009JZTOG8 New plot twists and characters true to Season One--and oh, so much more! I watch it with my daughter and grandchildren, so it's great for all ages."
B009JZTOG8 I am amazed at the ratings decline from Season 1 & 2.  For fantasy fans, this is an awesome show.  From the stories crafted amongst the various characters as how they are in the present, but their histories in rich detailed background stories of how they came to be the way they are, leading to a greater sympathy, especially for the villains.  For children and adults, Henry's (the adopted son of one character and the biological son of two other characters) acting is superb and draws us in as the catalyst for unexpected changes.  So many of the sets and costumes are dazzling and clearly no expense was spared.  The CGI is great for a TV series.  If you have missed any of the seasons or episodes, I highly encourage you to retrieve them.  Last year I obtained both the Amazon Instant Video and the Blu-ray versions of this series.  This year, money is tight, so for now I'll live without the Blu-ray.  If you missed the first commercial on the 5-5-13, it is hilarious.  At any rate, this is a show that can be loved by the whole family.  WATCH IT!!"
B009JZTOG8 I must say I was surprise with the first season ending and then with everyone getting their memory back, etc.  One of the best things about this show is that the pacing is just right.  For other shows it wouldn't be until the last season that you would get this much of a shift in the plot."
B009JZTOG8 There are some big changes in Storybrook in this second season of \"Once Upon a Time.\"  With the breaking of the Evil Queen's spell at the end of last season, Storybrook's residents are once again aware of their fairy tale identities.  However, nothing in this dual world of reality and fairy tale is ever simple.  For one thing, no one can leave town.  For another, it isn't easy to get back to the original enchanted land that is home for the characters.  For a third, Regina, the once and future evil queen, just can't seem to go straight, locking horns with Prince Charming, with Mr. Gold, and finally with a long lost relative.There will be excitement and enchantment galore in the second season, as the backstories of yet more characters are revealed, and as characters travel between their two worlds.  Emma and Snow make a dangerous trip back into the land of enchantment, only to be stranded and left in mortal danger. Their journey will give Snow a chance to teach Emma about motherhood and magic.  Along the way, Emma will finally begin to understand that her own powers may extend past her street smarts and pluck.  Her journey, and the viewer's, will be enhanced by meeting THE Captain Hook (who comes with his own complicated backstory) and Jack's bean stalk (and the Giant).  Prince Charming will be acting sheriff in Emma's absence, and face his own challenges, including a missing Henry and the framing of Red for murder.  Regina will struggle to keep a promise to foster son Henry not to use magic, while she and Rumplestiltskin may be compelled, unhappily, to cooperate to face a truly dangerous opponent from their collective past, an opponent who will force life-changing choices on a number of characters.One of the attractions of the show is its creative mixing of fairy tales from any genre.  How else, for example, to explain Ruby (a werewolf in her alternate identity) talking Dr. Victor Von Frankenstein into performing life-saving surgery on an auto accident victim? \"Once Upon a Time: The Second Season\" is very highly recommended to its fans, who are likely to enjoy more good storylines and excellent work by a solid ensemble cast."
B009JZTOG8 After watching season 1 I couldn't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. I only hope the show continues to season 3! (I hate cliffhangers!)  It is very refreshing from all the usual shows on TV. The show is very well done. There are very few shows out there that I just wish had more and would go on and on - this is one of those rare shows.  Anyone who likes to enjoy (a twist on) fairy tales and magic won't be disappointed.As much as I loved season 1, season 2 is even BETTER!  This season introduced us to Captain Hook - GREAT character!  I hope the show continues!"
B009JZTOG8 This was a great way to catch up, and I am thinking of seeing it this way in the new season, because commercials are taking more and more of regular TV air time."
B009JZTOG8 ABC Studios gives fairy tale lovers a wonderful gift with the release of \"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season.\" The 5-disc box set features all 22 episodes and a satisfying amount of special features for those looking for a peek behind the curtain. The show continues to spin a complex web of intrigue and fantasy in its sophomore year.The curse is broken and magic has come to Storybrooke. The citizens of the town now remember who they were in Fairy Tale Land. They must come to grips with their present lives as the memories of their past lives and who they were all come flooding back to them. The adjustments are made even more difficult with the arrival of Regina's evil mother, Cora, and her devilish associate, Captain Hook.The script writers for \"Once Upon a Time\" know how to keep a viewer glued to the screen and emotionally attached to the characters. They constantly switch between Fairy Tale World and the present-day town of Storybrooke to keep things interesting. Where some shows may feel crowded with too many characters, that isn't the case here. Each person fits into the different plotlines and contributes what they need to.New special guest stars are always popping up on \"Once Upon a Time.\" In Season Two, we get some interesting talent showing up. Rose McGowan, Ethan Embry, and Elizabeth Hershey are a few of them. Elizabeth Hershey and Rose McGowan both play Regina's mother, Cora, at different ages. They couldn't be more perfect for the deliciously evil role. They give the character an emotional depth and motivation which make you feel sorry for and despise her all at the same time.Whether you've seen the show in HD or just regularly broadcast, \"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season\" is a delight to see on Blu-ray. The rich colors and perfect picture clarity will enchant audiences as they watch the episodes for the first or second times. A 5.1 surround mix brings Storybrooke and Fairy Tale Land to life with the sounds of the enchanted forest, New York City, and a breathtaking musical score.There's some entertaining bonus material for the Blu-ray edition of \"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season.\" Six audio commentaries include actors Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle, Lana Parrilla, and Colin O'Donoghue as well as co-creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, writer Jane Espenson, writer Ian Goldberg, writer Andrew Chambliss, and co-executive producer David H. Goodman. It also contains four featurettes entitled \"A Fractured Family Tree,\" \"Girl Power,\" \"Sincerely, Hook,\" and \"Good Morning Storybrooke.\" Deleted scenes and bloopers round out the extra features.\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season\" will provide fans of Disney Princesses and Grimm's Fairy Tales with hours of excitement. It mixes the romantic and dark elements of both worlds together in one phenomenal show. Be sure you start watching it with enough free time in front of you. You'll no doubt find yourself unable to pull yourself away from the television once it gets rolling."
B009JZTOG8 it's a mash-up of all the fairy tales you ever knew, in a funny, dramatic and great way! It's a sure bet for fantasy lovers!"
B009JZTOG8 First season was more fun,but still enjoyed second season. Rumpelstiltskin and the evil queen are my favorites. Good clean fun. Looking forward to season 3."
B009JZTOG8 I did not watch this show while it was on till the very end. But once my doctor told me what it was really about, I started watching it from the beginning and played catch up over two weekends and finally saw the last couple of episodes on tv.  I will definitely watch the next season as I am now a believer. I have become invested in the characters. I have to admit is is a Great TV show!!!"
B009JZTOG8 I love this show.  It's fun to watch. I have enjoyed season two as much as I enjoyed season one."
B009JZTOG8 Note: I'm watching this show with XFinity On Demand.After an incredible first season, including a very emotional season finale, Once Upon A Time roars back with a vengeance, literally. ABC continues to do right by this series, and the stakes are getting higher with each episode. The way Emma makes her entrance is pure genius on the writers' part and absolutely perfect. I nearly cried during that scene. Keep it up, ABC."
B009JZTOG8 I am completely addicted to this show.  I can't wait to see the next episode.  Interesting to see the spin these writers put to our classic fairytales."
B009JZTOG8 Interesting story line of roughly parallel worlds.  Excellent actors, but also being asked to play some whiny princess characters. Hence the drop from an all out excellent rating."
B009JZTOG8 I just so happened to fall in love with this tv show during the first season and pre-ordered the second!! It's an inventive re-imagining of all the old fairy tales that have become common knowledge. Its got great acting and exceptional plot twists and it's great to watch upbeat tv again!!! I love it and can't wait for the third season!!"
B009JZTOG8 I was a big fan of Season One of ONCE UPON A TIME and I eagerly anticipated Season 2 on DVD. Season 2 took my by surprise and not in a good way. A fun take on classic fairy tales has become a constant shift of characters and plot lines. ONCE UPON A TIME has put a lot of actors to work as nearly every episode introduces a new character or re-introduces one who has gone missing. The problem is there are so many characters and so many story lines that things are getting beyound silly.The basic theme is good versus evil. Emma, Mary Margarite (Snow White) and David (Prince Charming) have an alliance against Regina (the Evil Queen), Cora (Regina's mother) and Mr. Gold aka the Dark One aka Rumplestiltskin. When good is about to triumph, evil kicks in and the never ending story continues. Back stories keep going on and nothing is linear in time. The modern day was a consistant but that is no longer true as time jumps for the present back 28 years ago.The taking peoples' hearts was over the top this season. Enough of all this! Please!! Tell a story and develop a character and story line. Much to my disppointment a new character with an interesting story appears and is dead in the same episode. Why bother? And the puff of purple magic smoke that is used over and over again by Regina and her mother is used over and over again.There are some great actors in this series but there are so many stories going that it's hard to keep track. Mr. Gold and Regina both try to go \"good\" but nothing good lasts.Portals open and \"humans\" come to Storybrooke and the city's inhabitants are in danger. To confuse matters more, these fairy tale characters are joined by literary characters such as Hook (as in Captain Hook) and Dr. Frankenstein. Are classic TV show characters next.I was disappointed in Season Two but the season finale caught my interest so no doubt, I will be watching Season 3."
B009JZTOG8 We loved the first season of Once Upon a Time on Netflix so much that we just had to get the second season as well.  It was worth its weight in gold.  Very entertaining and enjoyable show, and paying for a TV pass meant we got to watch it the day after it came out."
B009JZTOG8 I was a fan of Lost and this series is similar to it. There are several characters and their different worlds to keep up with, but that's what makes it a good program. It's not always predictable and most of the time the show is over before I want it to be, and that's usually the sign of a good movie/series."
B009JZTOG8 There should have never been a second season as far as I am concerned. Season one should have ended with and they lived happily everafter just like the fairy tale."
B009JZTOG8 Fairy tale characters like you have never imagined them.  Or, well I never did.:)  I would not recommend for kids under 10.  Some scenes can be a little unsettling."
B009JZTOG8 This series continues to turn our childhood fairy tales on their ear.  It's a continual surprise to see what the writers have in store for the audience.  The plots are as twisted as a ball of tangled yarn resulting in surprise after surprise."
B009JZTOG8 This show has potential but I fear they are writing themselves out of a series rather quickly from the way this series ends."
B009JZTOG8 Love this show. The childhood anticipation is eat at to see who will show up next while the unique storylines tie them all together satisfies the adult viewer in me."
B009JZTOG8 Snow recovers from her whack on the head to discover Cora talking to Emma, and immediately goes into protective mother mode. Both ladies get a surprise when the leader of the lost island literally throws them a rope to get out of the pit. It is Snow's old friend Lancelot, and he is glad to help Snow, Emma, Mulan, and Aurora continue on their journey. When an ogre attacks Emma, Snow slays him with an arrow to the eye and the ladies reach their final destination - Snow's castle. The magic portal tree is still there, and Lancelot shows up to help carry the tree back to the lost island. At that point everything goes awry, and Snow and Emma are back to square one. Back in Storybrooke Henry is being hardheaded, and Charming has to save Henry from his own reckless actions. Sebastian (The Mad Hatter) finally reunites with his daughter Grace, and Charming teaches Henry sword fighting, while an old foe watches from his car. There was too little Regina in this episode, but the thought of Regina and Cora going head to head somewhere down the line is extremely tantalizing."
B009JZTOG8 This show is one of my favorites also.  I purchase them so I can watch when i am able to."
B009JZTOG8 The series has everything...  Imagination, good vs. evil, excitement, so totally different from anything else airing. (Though I do see some copycats starting to emerge)  It takes all the familiar bedtime stories and fairy tales, and because of a curse of the &#34;black queen&#34; opens a portal to a small town in Maine where all these people (characters) now live unhappily ever after.  Until Emma is brought to town to break the curse.  The rest you need to see for yourself."
B009JZTOG8 Season One was fine.  There was a lot to learn about the characters, their back story, and the discovery process was interesting and fun.  In Season Two everything has slowed down and turned into a Soap Opera.  I find myself losing interest in the stories and characters."
B009JZTOG8 This review duplicates the one I wrote for Revenge. I love this show and I love being able to watch it commercial free. I've given up expensive TV cable/dish providers. I stream Netflix, Amazon, and other free channels with my Roku device and laptop. I dread the day our internet charges sky rocket because the cable/dish providers start noticing the money they are losing because of streaming."
B009JZTOG8 To go along with all this cheesy acting.I didn't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end. I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from \"Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful\" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of \"good\" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same \"I want to help\", \"your a story book character\" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know \"he's just a kid\" yeah and a terrible actor. I wouldn't cared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother. I mean think about it she feeds him well, buys him toys to play with, drives him to school, takes him out eat, I mean what the heck. She's a great mother but this kid can't stop complaining about her. For what? Pampering and spoiling him? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic. If this show stuck to the point and didn't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching. Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.and by all means do bring the thumbs down. Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is. Semi interesting plot trouble by bad writing/acting."
B009JZTOG8 I was expecting a goofy storyline and puns. Turns out the storyline is entertaining and thats what I want, to be entertained. Knowing this is worked around fairytale characters, it doesn't go too far over the top."
B009JZTOG8 This fun tv show that intermixes fairy tales and classic  stories to make a interesting fantasy show is a hit show for abc. In this episode Regina is framed for murdering jimminy cricket. She's set up by her mom and from this point on we begin to see her perhaps return to being more evil. Not that she wasn't evil in the first series, she killed a man by squeezing his heart to pieces in that season. The second season is as good as the first one and it's different in many ways. You do need to see the first season to understand the story arc."
B009JZTOG8 This series will die if they keep waffling with the characters...some unexpected evil is all right...but we like to think that even characters with magical powers can change for the better."
B009JZTOG8 I love the characters, the plot, and the story line.  It keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat."
B009JZTOG8 I guess I'm still a kid at 71 years old but I love this series. I really think it's aimed at an adult audience not really for small children."
B009JZTOG8 I would recommend this to anyone who has watched the first season it  carries on the storyline and is great watching love all the characters"
B009JZTOG8 Now, as Magic arrives in Storybrooke, new problems emerge.  As a wraith sends Mary Margaret and Emma back to the Enchanted Forest, Sleeping Beauty, along with Mulan and Prince Phillip, must fight to get them back home, even though a certain Queen, and a certain One Handed Pirate are determined to stop them.After this Queen is defeated, a new threat emerges, outsiders.  What could this mean for Storybrooke, and more importantly, for Henry?"
B009JZTOG8 I love watching Once Upon a time both on amazon and on TV every night and hope that the show would move on to a third season."
B009JZTOG8 This show is well written, and they obviously have a large budget. Hope to see it for a few more seasons...Highly recommended!"
B009JZTOG8 If you are a fan of the series, definitely a must have for your collection.  Excellent twists and turns, looking forward to the release of Season 3"
B009JZTOG8 I liked this series better during the first season.  Season 2 was more confusing as it moved rapidly between times and worlds.  It was hard to keep track of the story."
B009JZTOG8 This second season has the characters stuck in Neverland, and it drags on and on.Sorry to say that i lost interest."
B009JZTOG8 My wife and and I absolutely love this show and it's one of the best shows....Period! If you enjoy those classic fairytales this show is for you and has a very interesting twist on characters and stories. Just watiing to see what new character comes next is great. Plus for all you Lost fans, which I've never watched it, there is a lot of Lost Easter Eggs in the show."
B009JZTOG8 This is another show that breaks from the norm and sets a new standard for a show that is different in so many ways.  Season 2 lives up to the standards set by Season 1.  The bad guys in this show is balanced nicely with the good guys.  Even the main character-Regina, trying to change for her step-son.  Highly recommended show."
B009JZTOG8 I have been waiting it seems like an eternity to see what happens and it was worth the wait.  Regina seems like she is in trouble, the seven dwarfs are upset,-not just grumpy,and Mr.Gold is- well you must watch it.  Believe you me, it was worth the wait."
B009JZTOG8 I have recently become a fan of this series. I gave the rating because this series has a great ensemble cast and really good writing. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of any shows like this one."
B009JZTOG8 I love this show!  Bringing back the children's stories with an modern twist is just fascinating to watch. Most of us have a history with the children's story and when you add &#34;today's&#34; portion of the story and move back and forth through time to create an ongoing story it is fascinating.  You need to watch two episodes and you will be hooked."
B009JZTOG8 Season one is very different from season two but other than a few weak episodes it was as magical as season one (season one had a few weak episodes too). I'm looking forward to season three, will Niel and Emma find each other again?"
B009JZTOG8 I have to find out if the characters ever get restored to their homes and life in the enchanted forest."
B009JZTOG8 I am really enjoying this series. I do not usually like network television but my sister got me hooked on this. Subsequently, I got the rest  of the family hooked on this. Have also enjoyed the broadcast of season three and like having the blu-ray dvds to revisit."
B009JZTOG8 I love this show. It is refreshing and has just enough drama that the whole family can watch with some limitations for younger children. It is fun and a nice take on all the fairy tales and their characters."
B009JZTOG8 I truly enjoy this series,it takes fairy tales and makes it real and fun! The cast is wonderful and always amazes me to see how they interact witheach other and the storylines. I love it!!"
B009JZTOG8 I continue to enjoy the re-telling of fairy tales with a modern twist - fabulous scenery and special effect - love the wolf girl!"
B009JZTOG8 I didn't think they could do better then season one, I really thought season two would be lack luster.  Instead it is better then season one!"
B009JZTOG8 I read the background on this series and though oook.  Turned out to be entertaining.  The twists and sometimes mysteries to the story pull the viewer in."
B009JZTOG8 &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34; takes me to a place in my mind that I like to visit from time to time."
B009JZTOG8 If you loved Heroes or Firefly... You will love this.  See Disney characters--both villairns and heroes in a whole new light.  A marvelous mixture of fantasy and the real world."
B009JZTOG8 Giants, ogres, werewolves, Frankenstein, Mulan, Captain Hook ... what do all the things have in common?  Once Upon a Time Season Two, that's what!  This is the series that has single-handedly changed the face of television fantasy and made ABC a major player in creative, prime-time entertainment.This show has almost limitless possibilities and (at the writing of this review) is creatively satisfying the potential of an ever-expanding setting while maintaining continuity with previous episodes.  To date Once Upon still hasn't sold out to the HBO/Showtime/AMC paradigm of dark/edgy/gritty; a thematic bandwagon I'm so sick of I could literally vomit and more importantly they stick with the main characters from season one, continuing to develop them in a huge way (e.g. the welcome \"manning up\" of Charming) while constantly introducing new ones.Also, I've sort of come to expect sub-standard or straight-up cheesy FX from television as a given and this is where Once Upon just continues to amaze me.  What I really find astonishing is when I hear other people actually labeling the CG as bad... I guess I just don't get it.  I mean if we see a dragon on TV we already know it's not real; we just hope it's convincing enough to maintain the illusion that the events we're watching might actually be taking place somewhere... out there.  I say kudos to the producers for their frugal reliance on CG which is inherently a technology always one step ahead of being outdated and overly scrutinized as more people become fluent in graphics tech.  In other words, too many people know how the trick is done to maintain the illusion if it's the only trick up the sleeve, so to speak, and so I guess it's a good thing that Once Upon excels in the areas of camera-work (including green-screen), costumes, sets, lighting, makeup, fighting and action choreography.This is a bigger season with more action, lots of unexpected and clever plot twists, new realms and more fantasy than season one with just enough added drama to enhance adult appeal without detracting from the original premise; less emphasis on Emma, spotlight on Charming and Snow as their characters are reinvigorated, less of Henry, much more of The Dark One (i.e. Mr. Gold), sllightly less screen-time for the Evil Queen as new dangers and villains are introduced and based on the way this series is gaining momentum, I'd predict it may very well be a five year run because it just \"feels\" like the writers, producers, actors etc. actually enjoy what they're doing.  :o)"
B009JZTOG8 This is a great series.  I hope they keep it on the air a long time.  Super fast shipping.  Extremely pleased with entire purchase.A++++"
B009JZTOG8 I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)- in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's an update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said \"In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.\" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say \"They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?\" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT, he describes the behavior and bizarre \"reality\" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV Series THE CROW, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or the movie FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)- and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: \"Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!\" Or: \"Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!\" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for. If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.

B009JZTOG8 What an incredibly imaginative show. I find myself believing it all makes perfect sense, even though I know it does not. I was incredibly, wonderfully surprised. This is one good show. It will steal your heart. Literally.So beware."
B009JZTOG8 They'll love the second season. And looks like a 3rd season is in the works This could go a few seasons more from the looks of it. As far as fantasy show's this is in the Top 3 or 5 for some. My wife loves it."
B009JZTOG8 Started watching this show in its second season and am hooked! Fresh new spin on classic fairytale stories you grew up listening to"
B009JZTOG8 It helps to know and have read the fairy tales, nursery rhymes, etc. you heard as a child.The most prominent of them is Snow White in this series. The second season carries on where the first left off, filling in blank spots here and there.  It becomes addictive in a way hard to explain. The character know they were in a fairy tale and by a curse, came to a place where magic is lost.  They were not happy about that, but hey, such is life in the new world, Storybook, where they and we live."
B009K0OL06 really great show.  keeps you on the tips of your toes wanting more.  I love it and will continue watching."
B009K0OL06 I love Revenge! The first season was so exciting, and now season two is even way better! Still with drama, twists and a lot of mystery, the show still pulls off some amazing episodes. And this is just the second season!Now we get to know more about Emily's origins and less about the Graysons (thank god), and we also get to explore a little bit more of Nolan's life in Nolcorp, and some new characters from the past of the characters.I think Revenge is one of these shows that you'll never get tired of watching, no matter how many times you watch a certain episode, it's entertaining, with a talented cast and an amazing location: The Hamptons.It's worth the pre-order, and I still can't wait to see how this season unfolds!"
B009K0OL06 revenge two is a very exciting season . this last episode and what happened to Amanda and jack. so sorry for Emily."
B009K0OL06 I recently saw season 1 and I was hooked. I love all the characters especially Gabriel Mann. His witty one liners have me coming back each week."
B009K0OL06 The characters became even clearer this year.  The battle for Emily ids far more complex between Daniel and Jack, with Nolan there to help and counsel.  Victoria showed how far she would go to protect her children.  Hoping Declan return some how Charlotte and he are couple delights to watch."
B009K0OL06 One of  the things I love about this show is that each episode never fails to intrigue and leaves you wanting more."
B009K0OL06 Joan Collins was the woman everyone watched on DYNASTY, an evening soap which ran a few decades ago. Madeline Stowe has donned that mantle as the matriarch everyone loves to hate as Victoria Grayson in REVENGE. Whenever she is on camera with another character, you know the claws are coming out!  I especially like it when her ex husband gets into it with her. They can't stand one another and just spit and claw at one another when forced to be in the same room, which is frequently.Emily, our revenge prone protagonist, is actually a little tiresome in comparison. Her harping on and on about her revenge is turning everyone off. However, what is taking over as an issue for her, which may take over the revenge plot, is that her mother has now appeared.  She is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. I am really looking forward to seeing Stowe and Leigh come together.  That should be fun, especially since Stowe was the one who stashed her in the nut house.I actually did not think I would like this but Stowe made me a convert."
B009K0OL06 Simply amazing entertainment.  First season is available on netflix, purchased second season here and worth every penny.  You will love to hate Victoria!"
B009K0OL06 Revenge from the pilot episode has been on the edge of your seat riveting LOVE ITCant wait for the next showing"
B009K0OL06 I have been an advanced student of Metaphysics for over 25 years, and this show is incredible.  Although they have fictionalized it for our entertainment, they use a whole lot of of underlying truths.  Very well done."
B009K0OL06 This would have to be one of my favorite seasons of all time! It makes me mad sometimes due to what happens in the episodes, but that's what makes it interesting! Highly recommended if you love mysteries, romance, conflicts, gore....all around awesome season!"
B009K0OL06 DYNASTY AND NIKKITA WRAPPED TOGETGER! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WATCHING THIS SERIES! ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING FROM BEGINNING TO END! GREAT!"
B009K0OL06 This is my favorite show. I love how complex the plot gets. I can't wait to see what happens next!"
B009K0OL06 I can never guess what is going to happen next.  The writers are great at building in sneaky twists and turns to always keep you guessing.  The sets are amazing too!"
B009K0OL06 Revenge grabbed ahold from the first episode and has never let up. The writers' creativity is remarkable as they weave characters in and out without sacrificing the main goal for the lead actress Emily, revenge for her father's conviction for a crime he did not commit.  i"
B009K0OL06 I have only watched only Episode of this season so far.  It was really a good show in the first season and I think the second season will be even better."
B009K0OL06 I think 2 dollars to watch one episode is to much but I paid it since our DVR didn't record Resurrection. It's sad when you get caught up in a series you know isn't all that good but you want to know what you missed just in case the show gets better.Revenge is like watching any of the afternoon soaps, just one of the few that doesn't have anything to do with vampires. The acting is good/o.k. but the plot is wishy washy trying to find twists and turns to keep peoples interests.The best part is no commercials!! It's almost worth the two bucks not to have to watch the plethora of commercials !"
B009K0OL06 I really like this series.  Season 1 was a little more intense then season 2.  For a change, it's the money people messing over other money people instead of sticking it to the little person."
B009K0OL06 I am so bored by the series by now I hardly care what happens.  So I warn you about getting involved, because the first season was the best, and it went downhill from there.  But once one is hooked, one stays to the end.  Ugh"
B009K0OL06 Purchased this before I found out I could view on hulu! The quality of the programs on Amazon is excellent and if you can spend the extra money its nice not to have all the commercials."
B009K0OL06 Revenge Season 1 was very good but Season 2 is getting complicated with so many characters and everyone is plotting againsteach other.  It's becoming less real."
B009K0OL06 Wife really enjoys it. I like it enough to watch it with her and be entertained. A couples must see."
B009K0OL06 It's like a murder mystery wrapped in an espionage mystery with Amanda Clarke pursuing her revenge plot and headed straight for an international conspiracy."
B009K0OL06 I was really surprised in watching Season 2, I am looking forward to Season 3"
B009K0OL06 What can I say...I haven't missed an episode yet. I hate those Graysons :) and love seeing what Amber is going to do next."
B009K0OL06 This show is so soapy you could wash your hands with it. Then your body.  Then you could put a little in your hair for a nice shampoo.  That being said, it's entertaining into the bargain as long as you accept and anticipate the cheese factor. Which I do. My favorite character is Victoria Grayson. An ice queen, yes, but she's quite lovely even in her advanced years.  As for Emily Thorne, vengeant bunny, well, I guess there wouldn't be much of a plot without her, though I kind of think she should just marry Daniel, who is really a much nicer guy than Brit stud Aiden, who's kind of an arrogant fool in spite of \"being on the right team\".  Daniel on the other hand, in addition to having a beautiful mother and a ruthless yet witty father, is really not guilty of any of the crimes of his parents.  I think Emily should finish up her revenge on the parents and then go settle down with Daniel somewhere.  I suppose Jack might be ok as well, but I think Daniel deep down is still more Emily's speed when all is said and done.  Too bad she's wasted so much time on that goofball Aiden. I'm sure she'll start up on Jack in the next season.  Who knew Emily would have so many lovers into the bargain of her revenge.Once in Paris, she and Daniel could get into television and do a \"Baywatch\" for the next millenium.  Or Emily could open a karate school."
B009K0OL06 Note: I have seen every episode in HD via XFinity On Demand.After the shocking season finale, what would happen in the Hamptons? And was Emily's task really complete? Not by a long shot. Her journey has only just begun, and each episode opens up new avenues to explore. You never know where the road to REVENGE will lead. Just follow Mr. Kelley and the brilliant team of writers...The Season II finale is everything the writers promised, and more. Heart-pounding. Jaw-dropping. Nail-biting. Heart-breaking. Suspenseful. Intense. Burning questions from Season I are answered...and even more are posed for Season III.To say anything more would spoil the fun. So, just sit back and enjoy the delicate dessert neatly packaged as a box of REVENGE."
B009K0OL06 Well worth your time if you like drama with a touch of action and suspense.  This series is a keeper."
B009K0OL06 I bought Season 2, knowing from the reviews that it would be much more complex and difficult to follow than the first season.  But, hey, I decided, I'll just watch each episode twice to make sure I can follow it--and now I get to watch even more of Revenge!!  I'm guessing the producers are watching the feedback and will make the right changes so that Season 3 will be more to our liking."
B009K0OL06 This show has been nicely put together.  Just when you think it's going to be okay something else happens.  We love watching the season unfold.  There is so much betrayal; it's hard to even see half of it coming.  The plot is about a young woman who wants revenge for the atrocities that were made against her father.  She wants nothing more than revenge.  Sometimes she has a heart but that just gets in the way.  The other characters are mostly just awful people getting what they deserve.  She is good!  Her best friend is quirky and has a great character as well."
B009K0OL06 Revenge is back and better than ever. I love this show. I pined all summer for this show. It was definitely worth the wait!!"
B009K0OL06 After watching Season 1, I have become addicted to this show. I keep wanting more and I hope it makes it to another Season."
B009K0OL06 This is definitely a soap opera that just happens to be shown at night. It isn't much different than say, Days of Our Lives, but I enjoy it's overdramatic moments just for the laugh factor. The guy who plays Nolan is especially awful, but acting ability doesn't seem to be a requirement on many t.v. shows, does it? (I mean, he whisper/growls his lines just like John Black on \"Days\"). Season one was definitely better than season two, but there are enough fun things going on that I still plan to watch season three. (I DO hope they get some new/better writers, however). For me, the best things about \"Revenge\" are Victoria's snotty speeches and the hot guys on the show. (As for Declan, he's a cute little guy who looks like he's still in junior high, and his girlfriend Charlotte is bigger than he is! That is the show's only mistake with the male casting, I think). If you enjoy a good, if melodramatic storyline full of secret plots, murder, illegitimate children, corporate espionage, comas, false identities, surprise relatives, political backstabbing, and of course, REVENGE then this is the show for you!"
B009K0OL06 THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild - especially at the Graysons. Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother's memorial service, the pregnant mother's swan dive at her baby shower, and the groom's arrest for murder at his wedding. My favorite character, the unpredictable Nolan Ross, played by Gabriel Mann, is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.It's not looking good for him in Season Three either.Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their \"Count of Monte Cristo\" revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format - and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon. For me, it's not as good as Season One, where Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives. I miss those photos, where she would cross off the guilty with a big red \"X\" after executing a clever payback.Now - surprise! - Emily has a boyfriend, a hunk she met in Master Takeda's school for revenge. There was no mention of this in Season One, but we are dealing with soap opera rules now, like is Amanda's baby Jack's or the result of a one night stand? Two major characters get over-the-top death scenes (where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not. They do.)Cinematography is excellent again, making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery, gorgeous sets and high fashion style. Madeleine Stowe, playing matriarch Victoria Grayson, wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode; the designer is recognized in the end credits, too. Sound is just fine for this dialogue-driven show; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries: executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy, and writer/co-executive producer Michael Foley on \"Illusion\"; executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry, writer/executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler (Jack) and Margarita Levieva (Amanda)on another, and creator/executive producer/writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on \"Truth, Part Two.\" The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three, so be on guard.There are three interesting featurettes: \"Schooled in Revenge,\" that gives us a peek at Master Takeda's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance; \"The Sound of Revenge,\" showing how iZLER composes music for the series; and \"Haute Hamptons: Dressing Miss Davenport\" with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters, focusing on Ashley Madekwe, who plays Ashley Davenport this time. There are deleted scenes on each disc and the bloopers on Disc 5 are funny again, mostly because it's a treat to see the so-serious Stowe and Henry Czerny (Conrad Grayson) crack upWho knows if the series will return to its thriller format? Once sucked into soap opera, it's hard to get out of it. \"Revenge: Season Three\" will premiere on Sept. 29 on ABC.-- Kay Reynolds"
B009K0OL06 this is a great show and I enjoy watching it.  Suspenseful and just a great show.  Such a mix of characters."
B009K0OL06 I love this series. I have the first season and the second season is a good as the first one."
B009K0OL06 I love the characters, the story line, and the clothes are amazing! I love everything about this show! one of the greatest shows out right now"
B009K0OL06 Can't wait for the next season.  Great characters, great plots, Great modern day adult soap opera.  Love that I can watch commercial free."
B009K0OL06 Accidently &#34; Missed&#34; the last episode.... and THANK YOU Amazon, for having it so fast.....This is truly a &#34; Tangled Web&#34; and so close to the truth... the average person, just does  NOT realize... Money is NOT all it is cracked up to be"
B009K0OL06 There's not much on TV I enjoy and I HATE commercials. I love that I can watch Revenge when I'm ready, commercial free. AND, I love Amazon.com for providing it."
B009K0OL06 This is a night time soap opera, it draws you in and you can't stop watching till you get to the end Great Show"
B009K0OL06 Faux Emily Thorne (aka Amanda) (Emily VanCamp) wants vengeance to those who killed her father.  The suspense and twists to the cause, in my opinion, is perfect.  It has great cliffhangers and keeps my family, friends and myself waiting impatiently for more.Madeleine Stowe as Victoria Grayson is at her best.  I can really believe that Madeline's character is the Queen of the Hamptons.  Cannot decide if I want to hate or like Victoria.  But never the less always cheering for faux Emily.SPOILERAs for the faux Amanda Clarke (aka Emily) (Margarita Levieve), I was really sad to what happened to her as well as Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler).END SPOILER.Gabriel Mann as Nolan (Mitchell) Ross is a good character.  Gabriel does a good job be the likeable geek trying to help faux Emily.Barry Sloane as Aiden Mathis oozes a sexy mystery man.  I am both pleased and curious about this guy's appearance in the show.Can't wait for more.... come on Sunday... come by faster."
B009K0OL06 Season one was very good.  The writers seem to have lost their way.  The plot is now incomprehensible.  Too bad, but like many shows, it simply ran off the rails.  Bizarre."
B009K0OL06 I would recommend this to anyone who has seen season one the storylines keep you hanging I love the series and the actors are great"
B009K0OL06 Actors and actresses blend well together Edge of your seat addictive Thriller.What Happens next Hope the seasons keep coming along"
B009K0OL06 Intriguing, had to purchase second season after watching the first season. I'm now thru with the second season and wait to watch the next episode, It's very addictive."
B009K0OL06 This show is simply amazing and the picture/audio quality is first class.  I absolutely love the convenience and dependability of amazon instant video and I am proud to be a valued customer.  I would recommend this product to any and all fans of the show.  It saves the time of waiting on a DVD purchase."
B009K0OL06 I love this show and there is so much going on that i want to rewatch them to pick up on the things I missed the first time around."
B009K0OL06 This show is great. I talk about the character with my wife when we aren't watching. I don't do that about any other show. Great!"
B009K0OL06 Love Emily in this roll. Season three has gone astray. I hope they get back to the plots and how she carries them out. This year it's as though she isn't in charge and I don't like that. Maybe they'll get back to what made the show so famous. They need to kill off either Daniel or Charlie!"
B009K0OL06 I purchased this for my sister. She was sick and missed a show so I bought this show for her to catch up."
B009K0OL06 Great charactors to &#34;watch out for&#34; in this story.  At one point I truly could barely wait to see the following week.  Bu
B009K0OL06 Character's are clever and unique. Really enjoyed the acting and screen writing.  Look forward to next season. Very interesting. well done."
B009K0OL06 The wife buys it, she's happy so so am i.  Chick flick, I think is why she smirks at me more often these days."
B009K0OL06 one of my most fav shows!  Excitement, intrigue and drama!  Can't wait for next season!  IF you haven;t seen this show, you must watch!"
B009K0OL06 Once I had watched the first season, this was a must purchase.  The action (although a little different dynamic from season one) continues along with the character's complicated relationships that make good TV."
B009K0OL06 I am enjoying the series but not sure where the story line will take us or if it will get so convoluted that my interest will wain - will see."
B009K0OL06 Perfect combination of mystery, suspense, action!  Great story and cast... great show.  I just hope it lasts for many seasons!"
B009K0OL06 Great Season, loved it! Can't wait until the next episode to see what happens leading up to the finale, check it out."
B009K0OL06 The second season so far is great. Love the actors and actresses.  I really wish the main protagonist ended up with Jack and not the switched girl.  But oh well. I'ts not my show."
B009K0OL06 Dramatic surprising.. fascinating &#34;theatre&#34;... intriguing characters. both evil and mixed...setting also unusual .. costuming wonderful.. always a new twist from week to week....a good tv show all around..."
B009K0OL06 I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second.  It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left.  Or maybe they just ran out of things to say.  Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed.  Looks like I have to find a new favorite show."
B009K0OL06 I can't get enough of the characters and show.  I have watched this season and last season many times and now I can watch it anytime I want and as often as I want."
B009K0OL06 \"Revenge\" is back and it really does offer a lot more than what we are expecting.  I just love this awesome world that ABC has created.  I think this series is the 'resurrection' of ABC's rise back to power.(Big Time Warning:  \"There will be spoilers!  You have been warned!\")Last season we were left with the shocking discovery of Emily's mother being alive.  Not to mention the \"supposed\" death of Victoria Grayson.  Was that a cliff-hanger or what!  We return with season 2 to see Emily searching for mother and putting her revenge plans \"on-hold\".  I know, something we don't want to see happen, but we do see some results due to it.  To add to the list, Amanda is struggling with her relationship with Jack, especially with her being pregnant.  Declan and Charlotte are back together (what a surprise).  And we have Daniel, who is grieving for his mother and also \"hooking\" up with Ashley.  Oh, yeah, and Nolan is homeless (thanks to ordeals with Tyler and the White-Haired Man in the last season).  The only one who seems to be doing well is Conrad.Now that we have that all cleared up, lets review on how this season was like.  And I will try to keep my spoilers to a minimum (but no promises).  ;)Well, the season starts off not so bad.  We see the return of Victoria Grayson (don't get mad at me for spoiling that, we all knew she wasn't dead) and also the search for Emily's mother, which both of these storylines will leave a big impact on the season (at least in their own way).  We see the development into the terrorist organization known as the \"Americon Initiative\", who have been mentioned in the first season.  Also, we meet a new character in this series, someone who Emily has a history with.  I will also spoil that we will see pretty good development between Amanda and Charlotte in the beginning of this season.  And there is more trouble for Jack and Declan, as they take on a new enemy.Okay, I will admit that this season doesn't exactly sound like what we were expecting from how season 1 ended.  I completely agree that this season does pull away from the direction of what the first season had in mind and heads down another.I will admit that there are tons of things that went wrong with this season.  First off, the \"Initiative\" storyline (which is the biggest one).  I saw plenty of opportunities to make that story a great mix into the world of \"Revenge\".  It starts off in a good way, setting up the threat of what the Initiative can do and what they plan to do.  But it is the mid-section of the season that really goes down hill with that storyline.  It even gets a little confusing.  Secondly, the Ryan Brothers.  Now this was a storyline that I really loved.  I like how we got to see Jack and Declan take on their own enemies and also deal with the consequences of their father.  It goes pretty well.  Until they add a very familiar face to the picture.  I won't reveal who, but I think you will figure it out on your own.  Thirdly, Emily's rebirth of vengeance.  Now, there is a major event that happens by the middle of this season, one that really works and really fits.  I won't reveal exactly what, but I will try to explain.  This \"major event\" makes Emily realize that she has been concentrating on the wrong road and manages to put her back on the right path.  At first, we actually think it works.  But.... it doesn't.  Instead we see her waiting for the right moment, while also taking on the Initiative.  And fourthly, NolCorp.  I won't spoil what happens to Nolan's company, but I will go a little bit into it.  There is a storyline that involves something happening to NolCorp and it really impacts Nolan.  But we do see Nolan plan his own \"revenge\" (title spoiler) for what happened and it is actually a good plan.  But we don't see anything happen with this plan.  Nothing happens at all.Okay, we have went through what was wrong with the season, but now let me explain how this season still holds up and why it isn't as bad as you think it might be.In this season, we actually see a couple of characters, that we really like, get killed off  (I promise I won't reveal who).  We see Emily go through some hard times that we didn't get in the first season.  We see her struggle as her actions have reactions on the people she cares about.  And all of this actually sets-up really well for the third season.  If you actually think about it, while this season may have messed a couple of things up, it actually allows a new direction to be opened up to fix all of it for the next season ahead.  Now that is pretty impressive.  In fact, I think this season was meant to be a showing of what happens when Emily goes off course and doesn't concentrate on her revenge.  It shows that things get out of control and people die because of it.  So, in my mind, this season really does offer the one thing we never expected to see:  \"reactions\".  We all thought that season 2 would just continue Emily's revenge, but really it was just setting up the plot for the consequences of her actions from season 1.  Heck, we even learn a dark secret about Jack and Declan's father, one that comes back to threaten them.  Even Conrad has a \"really big\" secret that comes back to threaten him as well.  This season is about reactions, not making more actions.So, do you think this season is as bad as you think it is?  I, for one, don't think so.  Yes, it does go off course and it does head down a new direction that messes a few things up.  But it does offer something that seems to fit this season.  There is development in this season and it really does adds more to Emily than we know.Even though it may not be better than season 1, it still holds up as a good season.  It could be a lot worse.  At least there are some elements that keep it from getting worse.  Besides, season 3 gets better and it fixes everything that was done wrong in this season.  I say buy it, because no matter what, season 2 still deserves to be enjoyed and watched.  Just go ahead and buy it!"
B009K0OL06 This season is Awesome!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Like the show Dallas in the 80's."
B009K0OL06 Fantastic movie.  I love the story line and the characters are all strong and you just never see the next curve coming.  I would like to see more shows like this on Amazon Instant."
B009K0OL06 One of the best shows on tv right now. Love the acting and storylines. Good suspense and acting from all"
B009K0OL06 Emily continues down her path to clear her father's name and is letting nothing get in her way!  One of the better shows on Television!!"
B009K0OL06 I have purchase both seasons so far and I really enjoy watching them over and over again.  I can't wait for the third season to start."
B009K0OL06 Students of politics should love this series. Game theorists should too. Actually even ordinary mortals will love it. Although the title is Revenge, power is at the center of every episode. Understanding that power can be defined in terms of its resources, the principle resources in this instance are information and secrecy. It is no surprise that Amanda Clarke (actually Emily Thorn) is dead and Emily Thorn (actually Amanda Clarke) is still alive, although she has come through some close scrapes. It is the secrecy that has saved Emily from the ongoing maliciousness of the Graysons. Clarke was \"out\" and Thorn was still in the shadows. Of course with the aid of Nolan Ross, a low key tycoon and cyber wizard, Emily (actually Amanda in the shadows) is able to have access and opportunity to observe the mischief of the Graysons on their laptop, and watch the ongoing chicanery unfold. By remaining in the shadows they are able to toy with various Grayson endeavors. The tone of the story is superficial civility masking underhanded, backstabbing and ruthlessness. Even murder is in the vocabulary of malicious action for the Conrad Grayson, but Emily is a martial arts practitioner and capable of pointing a gun and squeezing the trigger herself.  Emily (actually Amanda) keeps score by recording an \"X\" through the  faces of pictures of her targeted foes stored in a box of \"keepsakes\" under her living room floor as she embarrasses or inflicts damage upon her targets. I love this series for its intricacy of the game. I once had a college professor tell me that a characteristic of great art is that it lacks immediacy. This seriously meets that test. There remains much enjoyment on subsequent viewings. I have watched both seasons at least twice."
B009K0OL06 This show is great, it is a masterpiece of soap opera. I hope it goes on for the next ten years."
B009K0OL06 Can't wait to see what happens next!  I love the characters and the plot twists!  It's a keeper for me!"
B009K0ZGJQ I and my wife are enjoying watching these. We can hardly wait to get through them to see what happens next."
B009K0ZGJQ I love the Mentalist!I have to admit I enjoyed the first season the most, but the 5th season is still going strong."
B009K0ZGJQ This show is extremely well written - each character has been not only well written but the actors are great.  If you haven't seen this series - try it!  You will love it."
B009K0ZGJQ First, you have to sort of turn off your ears everytime you hear them rant about &#34;red john&#34;.And a lot of those episodes, would likely make more sense if you were on some hallucinogens ofsome sort.Still in all, the plots are decent, the acting is good, only 2 dimensional in extremely short bursts.I continue to enjoy this series a lot.If you want a feel for where the series is, check out the first one in this season for the &#34;flavor',Patrick Jane, used to make a living as a psychic, torqued off a serial killer who killed his wife anddaughter, uses his skills to further torque off most of whomever he deals with and solve murders.He's been at this thing for years (nabbing Red John), and RJ is basically portrayed as a boogeyman capable of all sorts of insidious insanity, with a depth of cohorts and money that never seemsto end.Thing of it is, to date, no clue as to why RJ is out there killing all these people nor why everyoneis so anxious to help him do his dastardly deeds?  (But maybe I've missed a couple of episodes)Murders for the most part arent' rocket surgery, but still entertaining."
B009K0ZGJQ I love the mentalist characters but WAY done w red john.. find him, fix him or move on.. seriously, I LOVE LOVE LOVE cho.. and since I turned off my cable and only watch on amazon from now on.. but so happy to be able to access it from amazon.. a little pricey, but always there for me!"
B009K0ZGJQ Continually thought provoking and LOTS of variety.  The characters are deepened every year.  The relationships the characters have with each other and others are also dimensional,  Not the normal flat insipid TV psych-drama."
B009K0ZGJQ great show but the price its a bit too much for a dvd collection considering this series should be release on bluray."
B009K0ZGJQ Patrick Jane returns with his co-workers at CBI for the fifth season. I think this is the best season yet. I love to watch Patrick Jane watch the guilty and finally get the truth out of them. It is a great DVD set and I highly recommend it."
B009K0ZGJQ Thank goodness, there is still a show on tv that doesn't give me bad dreams or make me feel guilty watching it.  Patrick Jane is a great character and the cast works together nicely.  The writing is good and each episode is different.  I watched every season on Amazon in a month!"
B009K0ZGJQ The Mentalist is an awesome show! I absolutely love the fifth season of the show!! I hope that the writers can keep up the great job that they are doing! The cast is wonderful as well as the stories!"
B009K0ZGJQ I really enjoyed the first two or three seasons, but it's beginning to bore me. I think they should've stopped while they were still ahead!"
B009K0ZGJQ I thoroughly enjoy this show. There is some great humor in the way Simon plays his character. There is some more interesting developments in the Red John part of the story, Several twists and turns from episode to episode to keep it fairly fresh and new."
B009K0ZGJQ I'm so glad I decided to start watching this and that the entire series is ready when I am to watch! I really like the characters and their qwerks, the story lines running throughout are good, but they don't take over the theme of the series as a whole. Funny, but sad sometimes too, this has all the elements a good cop series should have including some lightheartedness. I highly recommend this series."
B009K0ZGJQ The always watchable Simon Baker is absolutely captivating, having found a riveting character to portray, with an excellent supporting cast."
B009K0ZGJQ This show is very good because I have always enjoyed cop-consultant shows. The Mentalist mainly focuses on Patrick Jane finding out who the serial killer known as Red John really is and trying his best to capture or kill him. He also helps the CBI with other cases by using his keen sense of observation with victims or suspects."
B009K0ZGJQ every one has their personality and sticks to it - but are all very moral decent peoplethe good thing if you watch on a regular basis - is that you see the ancillary California communities as the locationsthe best thing was Bradley Whitford's episode and the next best thing is Morena Baccarin's episode otherwise I found these episodes to be really horrible."
B009K0ZGJQ I love that it keeps us guessing about red john.  its not cut and dried.  would love to see teresa and jane get together on thedown low..."
B009K0ZGJQ Had to purchase the episode because this was one that wasn't available by demand from our cable company.  Generally a pretty good series.  One of the detectives has been pregnant and has gained weight.  I have missed any references to this pregnancy situation."
B009K0ZGJQ Highly recommended to all who love watching Simon Baker!  You'll enjoy this season especially the last episode.  I can't wait for the next!"
B009K0ZGJQ I thoroughly enjoy watching the Mentalist, have watched up to Season 5 am awaiting the release of Season 6"
B009K0ZGJQ When I first read about this show, I was intrigued by the premise, and I haven't been disappointed yet--not in one single episode.  The whole cast is terrific, the writing is amazing, and it manages the balance between funny and sad and frightening really, really well, so that I always feel satisfied with the quality of the story telling."
B009K0ZGJQ I didn't think I'd like this show but I'm hooked. Even if just to look at Simon I watched his other series the guardian it didn't last long this ones much better"
B009K0ZGJQ one of my favorite shows and certainly one of my favorite episodes.  will certainly watch it again and again.  you will too,"
B009K0ZGJQ Simon Baker is perfectly cast as the Mentalist.  I doubt if he will ever find another role like this.  He has reached iconic statu, so it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.  The supporting actors around him are well cast and the chemistry between him and Robin Tunney is perfectly balanced."
B009K0ZGJQ This episode was a really great prequel to the show.  You get to see the first time Patrick Jane met Agent Lisbon and the rest of the investigators in the CBI.You see Patrick Jane about a year after the murder of his wife and daughter by Red John so he is more of a mess than how you're used to seeing him.The mystery was interesting and the suspects presented were all entertaining.  The highlights of this episode were all the scenes with Jane and Lisbon alone, those earned it five stars right there.Simon Baker and Robin Tunney have really brought these characters to life and they are probably two of the most likable characters on any TV show in the last ten years.Obviously another plus about this episode is that we are finally allowed to see the face of Patrick Jane's nemesis Red John.  I am excited to see how they will continue from here.  A great 100th episode for one of the best crime shows to ever be on TV."
B009K0ZGJQ I still like the show but I can't see how it can continue once the Big Bad is revealed. Also, Patrick Jane is often too smug for my taste. Still the show is a cut above the usual drivel on TV."
B009K0ZGJQ I love this show.  The characters are very real.  There is humor both bold and subtle.  The mysteries are well written, and except for a mistake once in a great while, the watcher can suspend belief with this make believe investigative team of the CBI.  After all these seasons, we still aren't sure it Jane is a true physic trying to deny it due to the trauma in his life, or if his amazing abilities are really just a super sense of mental acuity.  I look forward to many more seasons of this entertaining show."
B009K0ZGJQ If you haven't seen this show, you have a treat coming. It is a fun mystery with some serious crime thrown in. But the best part is the great relations among the characters."
B009K0ZGJQ The &#34;assistant&#34; Patrick Jane has more than six senses and is very heady in every situation. This is MUST HAVE series because every single segment is so original and entertaining simply because Jane is so smart and intuitive."
B009K0ZGJQ I love the mentalist but the writers are spending way too much time on this red john angle. I fear that they are writting themselves off a cliff because every episode this season main focus is red john.They are not really focused on patrick jane's crime fighting skills. I can't even recall if there was another case being worked besides this red john angle. I fear that I'm going to have to start watching castle if they don't sh**t or get off the pot with this red john thing! Kill him already or kill the show! It has to be one or the other because as much as I love the mentalist, I am getting real tired of watching it! It's almost as bad as the alien angle on the x-files! Wow, towards the end I could have carved my eyes out watching that unfold! Lol. Get better please or else castle here I come! Lol!"
B009K0ZGJQ Patrick Jane follows his usual ritual of starting a homicide investigation at a victim's home, by going into their kitchen and making a cup of tea. As he drinks the tea and watches a monarch butterfly land on white orchids, a huge stainless steel pot on the kitchen stove begins to rattle. Inside Jane finds a rabbit with a diamond necklace around its neck. The rabbit escapes and Jane follows it into a gorgeous flower and maze garden, where a beautiful young girl claims the rabbit for her own. She also claims to be Charlotte, Jane's murdered daughter. Later Jane wakes up in a hospital bed and realizes he has been hallucinating.  But he is determined to go back to the crime scene and solve the case - even if Charlotte continues to follow him. The murder itself was vicious and the culprit is definitely one of the more horrific murderers presented in the series. This episode was comedic in some places, but the ending with Jane in his rooftop hideaway at CBI headquarters sipping tea is gut wrenching."
B009K0ZGJQ I have a few shows on Amazon that I purchase every week this is one of them.  I love to watch them over and over."
B009K0ZGJQ The horrific nature of the featured crime belies the loneliness that grows heartbreakingly deeper for \"The Mentalist.\"  An episode worth watching to the very end.3 Star:  the episodes in this season are strangely flat.  There is none of the vivid tension of the Red John journey that Patrick Jane has taken in the past.  Just watched \"Little Red Corvette\" and the lack of context that would make returning a child to his parent so poignant results in an anticlimactic conclusion."
B009K0ZGJQ I did not buy the whole season. I missed one episode and bought that one. If you missed the whole season, fine, buy it."
B009K0ZGJQ Patric James is entertaining, Chou is a hoot and adds much to the sad predictable theme. It is an easy way to burn some time."
B009K0ZGJQ I can't think of anyone who could play Patrick Jane except Simon Baker! This is a great show! I think the acting and writing are superb."
B009K0ZGJQ Clear dynamic presentation in HD.  No commercials and stereo sound round out an enjoyable presentation.  I will use the rental of episodes in the future as the need arises."
B009K0ZGJQ Patrick Jane does it again.  I loved the smack down at the end where he tells her exactly why she did.  I did figure out what was in the box.  Gross!"
B009K0ZGJQ I have watched this show since it began.  I like the banter between Lisbon and Patrick, but I also would like to see a little more between them, besides friendship.  You can see they would like more between them besides friendship."
B009K0ZGJQ I'm not sure how The Mentalist has lasted 5 years. It's not a bad show, but there are so many crime dramas on TV and The Mentalist is just one more. Like Bones and Castle, the show has a team of good looking good guys who inevitably triumph over most of the bad guys. The plots of the three shows are pretty much interchangeable, but Bones and Castle have a little more humor and a bit lighter focusing more on the relationship between the two lead characters. If you like conventional network crime shows (this is no Dexter) you might like The Mentalist."
B009K0ZGJQ This is one of my favrorite tv series. Yes, Patrick Jane always solves the murder and you wonder if his police counterparts could ever solve one by themselves. A little unrealistic at times but it is always entertainng. Mostly because Simon Baker does a terrific job of playing the compelling complex character, Patrick Jane."
B009K0ZGJQ This show is not your average cop show.  The show is based in Sacramento, Ca., and I'm happy that some of it is actually filmed there.  No doubt CBI's headquarters is filmed in L.A.'s film studios.Yes this show did start off with Jane tracking down Red John - his wife and daughter's killer.  Jane is still trying to catch this illusive serial killer.  And having copy cats and \"helpers\" doesn't really help Jane get any closer to Red John.  But for the past 5 seasons, this show has done a good job in showing that Patrick Jane has matured.  He can be both obsessed in finding Red John AND being able to function in other activities: I.e. helping Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney) investigate crimes.  His job is after all a paid consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Simon Baker plays a really good \"mentalist\" in this show.  \"Mentalist\" in Patrick Jane's perspective as an admitted fraud to psychic powers.  I liked how he commented in one show how there was no such thing as a psychic.  Simon Baker has received nominations from Emmy, Guild and Golden Globe for his performances.  I think he should have one at least one of those awards due to the fact that he really gets into character quite well.Robin Tunney is Jane's rock. She does a good job in keeping her character as a tough special agent. Her character still has a rough edge attitude in season 5. Robin has surprised me considering I still think of her as one of the witches from The Craft in 1996.I've watched this show from the beginning. The suspense and twists on Red John are great.  Cannot wait for more."
B009K0ZGJQ I love this series I am so hooked the storyline with red john is so interesting he is always one step ahead so cant wait to find out who it is would recommend to anyone"
B009K0ZGJQ I absolutely love everything about this show and everyone involved in this series.  It is the best in every respect."
B009K0ZGJQ The Mentalist is definitely one of my favorite shows and so good that's it's been on for so many seasons. We got backed up on season 5 due to various reasons and are DVR got backed up and missed the first half of this season so trying to get caught back up. We started watching recently and I remembered how much I love this show."
B009K0ZGJQ I bought this as a gift for my dad and he enjoys it.  He loves the show and he often watches old episodes."
B009K0ZGJQ Some shows, as they progress seem to loose confidence, but this show maintains a quality script with different episodes that entertain and inform.  Highly recommended."
B009K0ZGJQ My wife and I are fans of the Mentalist and have been following along since Season 1. It's a clever show with good chemistry between the characters. We also appreciate that it doesn't need to use foul language every other word or extreme gore or violence to make the show work."
B009K0ZGJQ I really like The Mentalist. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes NCIS, CSI, and shows like that. The writing is good and The Mentalist has become one of my favorite shows."
B009K0ZGJQ Simon Baker really gets into Patrick Jane's being. He's perfectly suited for this character and Robin, Tim, Amanda and Owain, complement Jane so well, it's symbiotic. Great actors, ALL OF THEM!"
B009K0ZGJQ It was a real battle to see if we were going to watch The Mentalist again this year.  It seem to have lost its steam; but this season, season five, is one of the best ever!  Now it is a must watch again."
B009K0ZGJQ Easy to watch and follow as an evening bit of tellie - not intellectually rigorous or particularly deep - but that is OK. Decent plots and character development though the reach of the nefarious &#34;Red John&#34; is unfathomably deep. Worth watching."
B009K0ZGJQ not even sure what its about but it must be a good one maybe on prime or something ill be watching to see what hes liking"
B009K0ZGJQ and the rest of the cast are just so endearing. I really didn't want to like this show. I didn't want to like Simon Baker. I don't watch this with anyone else in my family it is something of a guilty pleasure."
B009K0ZGJQ Just love this actor and the complete cast assemble.  It's an excellent idea and every week look forward to the new program"
B009K0ZGJQ I love &#34;The Mentalist&#34;.It is a well written show and the acting is NOT over the top-- you know how some shows seem to be trying to be &#34;cool&#34; or &#34;scary&#34; or really &#34;with it?&#34; That is getting old in my opinion.Not so with Patrick Jane and agent Lisbon- You can start watching this series anytime and really enjoy it. It has a smooth feel and does not attempt to confuse you or make you guess. It is just a well written and acted series.Thumbs UP!!"
B009K0ZGJQ I loved Simon in the Guardian and he just seems to get better and better with each show. I do hope there will be a 6th season."
B009K0ZGJQ I recomemnd this programme to anyone who likes Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is a police procedural elevated to a highly enjoyable level by the game of wits between Patrick Jane/Sherlock Holmes and Red John/Moriarty. It is my sincere hope that the final clash between Jane and Red John is a confrontation comparable to the final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty. There are so many parallels between Patrick Jane and Sherlock Holmes that my review would be over long. However, The Mentalist is the best of the Sherlock Holmes inspired take-offs for either movies, TV or literature. So, let it suffice to say that if you like the quirky, brilliant and driven Sherlock Holmes you are going to love quirky, brilliant and driven Patrick Jane of The Mentalist. Long live Sherlock Holmes. Long live The Mentalist."
B009K0ZLIM I saw not the Overlook Hotel, but the haunted New York apartment building based on the real life Dakota in Rosemary's Baby, complete with the research into the building's evil and storied past. It is a genre trope that I like, so for that alone and the potential therein I was hooked.A young couple, living on the fringes of New York glamour in terms of the company that their professions bring them (lawyer and architect) but in the sticks in Queens in terms of their income, is first tempted with the offer of a beautiful apartment on the Upper East Side of New York for a nominal amount of managing work. Indeed, in the interview they are told that they need to keep their day jobs, so clearly there is another person or people in the building doing daily maintenance work. They grab the opportunity as anyone in their right mind would as it takes rich person money to live a middle class life in Manhattant. Nobody tells you that cheap, beautiful apartments in Manhattant require not only money but your immortal soul.It turns out that the building has more than just beautiful views and fixtures. It is stated more than implied that the owner is at the very least the devil's henchman. In addition to introducing the core characters, we are introduced to what may be the \"tenant of the week\" who falls afoul of the gifts given by the buildings owner. This week a tenant has his wife brought back to life but cannot keep murdering to keep her alive and ends by losing his own life as well.All in all, I thought that this was a moderately promising pilot. I will be watching again and hope that the core characters are made more interesting in episodes to come and that the nefarious history of the building and its owners is uncovered at a steady pace. The innocent young couple trope and the older, urbane, devilish temptors has been done before not only in Rosemary's Baby but in the Devil's Advocate; this doesn't have to be a weakness but these weren't the strongest out of the box characterizations that I have ever seen and I hope they deepen and become more human and less carboard tropes as the season progresses. Recommended to fans of the new serials and mysteries. So far is unsettling rather than the real terror of horror, which works for me but may not for others. Definitely worth checking out to see how 666 Park Avenue develops."
B009K0ZLIM I feel like I am watching a Hitchcock movie when watching this show.  Suspense, mystery, along with great acting has made this one of our favorite shows.  Can't believe it has been cancelled."
B009K0ZLIM Creepy show that keeps you guessing what the plot will be next!!Only 1 drawback, it was not picked up for a second season.  : (  We are hoping the sci-fi channel or another independent will pick this up.  This type of supernatural phenomenon is not ready for prime time tv....come on sci fi!"
B009K0ZLIM Fulfilling people's wishes.  That is how Gavin Doran described his role to one of this tenants.  Watching the first episode, I thought this basically entailed people agreeing to bargain away their souls to get something that they desperately want.  Now, here we are, four episodes later and it seems the plot of the show may not be that simple.  Thank goodness, because otherwise, the plot will get very stale rather quickly.The setting of the story is New York.  The plot revolves around the residents of an upscale apartment building in the heart of the city, the Drake.  The Drake is an elegant old building, owned by Gavin Doran and his wife, Olivia.  The residents all have something they want badly.  Who doesn't, right?  Anyway, Doran has a way of helping them get what they want.  Sometimes, they know the price ahead of time.  Sometimes they don't.  And there is always an angle in the transaction that benefit Doran.  Gavin and Olivia live in the penthouse.  Henry and Jane, a young couple that the Doran's have hired to manage the property, also live on the premises.Right from the start, we are made aware that there is something spooky about the Drake.  Beneath the elegant exterior and the rich trappings, there is something evil residing within its hallways.  We do not yet know how, or whether, it's connected to Gavin.  But we do know that Gavin is aware of its existence, and uses it to further his business and financial interests.  Gavin takes an interests in two \"nobodys\", Henry and Jane.  He goes out of his way to open up opportunities for Henry, a struggling lawyer.  At this point in the story, we are not told what motivates him to do so.  Meanwhile, Olivia has introduced Jane to the world of the very wealthy.  Overwhelmed, flattered, and excited at first, Jane begins to suspect that there is more to the Dorans than what is outwardly obvious.  In this episode, Henry must choose between his friendship with Gavin and his career.  His superiors, who are enemies of the Dorans, threaten Henry's job security.  In order to appease them, he must agree to betray Gavin Doran.Ok, I do not want to spoil it for you.  This is worth your time to check out.  I have said it before, that the best shows are driven by both plot and character.  So far, the plot is nothing unique.  The characters are intriguing and you want to know how they will make out.  Yes, this is a show that loses characters just like a holey tire loses air.  Does it have enough to stick around?  I don't know the answer to that.  In my opinion, it has the same limitations as the show \"Grimm\".  I am not really sure how the writers can add more breadth to the story, given that the center of the story involves a limited group of people as well as the fact that most of the story take place within the Drake.  But we will see.  You certainly cannot fault the acting jobs of Terry O'Quinn, Vanessa Williams, and Rachael Taylor.  They all carry their parts very well."
B009K0ZLIM I had high hopes for this show, but now I see that it has been cancelled and will only run for 13 episodes. Sadly I am not completely surprised. This show really tries, and I think for many, it does not move fast enough. I was hoping also that since Terry O'Quinn from Lost was featured, that it would have more to offer, but I like O'Quinn's character and the rest of the cast in fact. That is the only reason that I keep watching. I like strange and creepy shows like this, and have been since the days of Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, The Outer Limits, Lost, Fringe, etc. I do like the setting for this show; a haunted old building called the Drake converted to an upscale apartment complex, and modern tenants confronted with the paranormal. I only hope that there will be other shows that are more successful aired in the future."
B009K0ZLIM This story line/show has such an complex and mysterious plot to it.  I am enjoying it very much as Jane tries to discover the hidden aspects of the Drake and of her past.  I'd run like a scared rabbit if it was me."
B009K0ZLIM This is a great, scary series with a good cast and interesting plot. It is well produced and compelling. I can't imagine why they would cancel this, while American Idol and Survivor are still on TV. Hopefully they will change their mind. From what I can tell this series was not well advertised. People can't watch it if they don't know about it, or when it is on.-edit= As some consolation, the network allowed them to \"finish\" the series. The new episodes are good, but you can see entire story lines, probably meant to play out over a season or two, finished in a single episode. It is enough to let us at least see where they were going; most series just diappear."
B009K0ZLIM I like my stories with some ambiguity and conflicted evil characters; this probably won't accomplish that.  However, the plot-lines hold your attention.  The female lead is complicated and innocent at the same time.  She presents an intriguing foil to the various villains in this series.  Her husband is a bit one-sided and less interesting than the rest of the cast.  There are some fun cameo appearances (Whoopi Goldberg for example) which surprise and delight.  One of the best features of this story is that the building itself assumes all the personality and intrigue of a full-fledged character.  It's the building's story that drives the plot-line and the characters day to day lives.  The stories introduce enough horror to make you nervous but not so much gore that you don't want to look.  Well done."
B009K0ZLIM This show is campy fun. It started of kind of weak on the scares that I expected, but started to reveal an interesting background/mythology that I want to know more about! So, I kept my TV pass! I hoep it wraps up strong so it keeps its 4-star rating."
B009K0ZLIM I can't believe I forced myself to finish the first season's 13 shows.  I think it was the fascination of just how terrible this series is in so many ways that it's amazing and drove me here to write a review.  Where to begin?  How about the cast and acting?  Where in h#@@ (pun intended) did they get these actors from - some community college acting class?  Except for Terry O', the acting was beyond awful.  And so badly cast that it made me laugh out loud several times.  Then there's the writing; wow, I don't recall hearing such mundane lines in a long time.  Actors walk into a room several times and ask, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;  What are you watching?&#34;  Are you kidding me?  There's no other way to evoke curiosity?  The sets were so fake, it was fascinating.  And if you are going to use CGI badly, don't use it at all.  The plot, at times, held promise, but that quickly disintegrated in a series of laughable twists.  Honestly, I got so many laughs from this series, so it  wasn't a complete waste of time."
B009K0ZLIM We were all told that they finished taping the series and we wpuld be about to see the episodes that explain & satisfy, and this is the same old stuff.  Was it just a hopeful rumor?"
B009K0ZLIM This show is truly spooky! It gets more shocking with every episode. I love the actors. Love the twists and turns!"
B009K72EP8 One of the best seasons yet full of action and events that set revenge of the sith in motion. Amazing animation and storyline as well as the duels are intense."
B009K72EP8 The clone wars is a very good series for all ages.  Season 5 is just as great as the other 4 seasons.  I like the episode about the droids mission.  I recommend this to everyone  good animation and good a good storyline."
B009K72EP8 It's fun entertainment and it keep the door open to the imagination of the Star War saga. And for anyone new to the Star Wars, it would bring them back for the next showing, just to see what is going to happen next."
B009K72EP8 I can't wait until season 6.  The graphics are good and story lines are good.  Occasionally, you may have 1 or 2 episodes with a boring story line."
B009K72EP8 Great series all the way through I really recommend this series's too anyone whoever likes a lot of action great acting voices and great mystery not to mention excellent animation if you like that you will enjoy this even season 1 through 4 from start to finish."
B009K72EP8 As always happens with the Star Wars: The Clone Wars the first few episodes are slow but then the series really picks up and the later season story arcs are almost impossible to stop watching."
B009K72EP8 Besides the droid arc in the second half of the season, I loved all the episodes of this season. The young Jedi episodes were fantastic, as were the Darth Maul/Savage episodes, the Onderon arc, and the powerful Ahsoka episodes at the end. This season is a must-see for Star Wars fans."
B009K72EP8 Need I say more. it's star wars and as you can see on cover of The Clone Wars Season 5, Darth Maul is alive! Can't wait for Episode 7 of the movie franchise. JJ Abrams will not disappoint."
B009K72EP8 Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work. It still won't work on my Sony blu ray player. No idea why. I don't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early. This is not how I saw my bday gift to my husband going. Thanks for making it a lame gift. So upset!"
B009K72EP8 I'm a little depressed that as for now this looks like the final season of this entertaining series and with a decent cliff hanger too, also it was tragic that many fans of the show know we lost a talented actor Ian Abercrombie who was the voice of Chancellor Palpatine. Some people feel the CGI animation is to childish to be taken seriously but I disagree,while not the realistic CGI version we've seen with the PC Games of Star Wars:The Old Republic the animation for the series was good and the action and story was also entertaining throughout the shows run.Hopefully with Disney getting the rights to Star Wars we may see a continuation of the series later on though I do hope they keep it at the same level of drama and action instead of truly making it a kids series.  Still for fans of the series or just those looking fora good show here's one to try out just a suggestion for newcomers though, get the first season as some of the show's storylines will confuse on what's happening with the main story and with the characters as well."
B009K72EP8 The clone wars is a great series that I really appreciate as it is one of the best star wars animations throughout the series."
B009KH9XX4 Thomas and Sarah are such devils, but always missing their marks..lol. i would have loved to have seen more of them"
B009KH9XX4 not as good as the original. leaves a little bit lacking. wouldn't recommend it as a must have. just ok"
B009KH9XX4 I loved seeing what Sarah and Thomas got up to after leaving Eaton place. I wish another season had followed after the cliffhanger ending. But I'm picturing them raising a family in a happy, contented style in a cozy little cottage. They deserved happiness."
B009KH9XX4 I have never become addicted to a TV show until now.  This show has superior acting from Thomas and Sarah, one surprise after another.  Too bad there are only 13 episodes.  I have watched them all.  Now what can take their place. Nothing can."
B009KH9XX4 ending was unclear and unexpected; but the story  kept one interested; the acting was good  especially that of Alderton as Thomas."
B009KH9XX4 An unusual pair of antagonists in somewhat contrived situations. The last episode of the final seasons makes one realize how deeply invested the viewer has become."
B009KH9XX4 I was a big fan of the original Upstairs Downstairs and recently reached the entire series. I remember hearing something about a spinoff with Sarah (far from my favorite character) but never followed up. When I saw this come up as a recommend show on my Amazon Prime page I couldn't resist, especially at a price of free.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the multiple locations and storylines. As much as I like the new BBC series with good production values, I still enjoy the unique characteristics of the old BBC series, cheap production and all."
B009KH9XX4 When I saw these two character in Upstairs Downstairs I loved them.  This series follows them after their time in service.  Sarah is just as fun loving as ever, and Thomas is still trying any get rich quick scheme he can lay his hands on.  They are heart warming, funny, raucous, and wild as ever in this series.  It was so much fun, you just never knew what they were up to next.  Pauline Collins was excellent and really carried the show off with panache.  Once again, I loved the costumes and the hairstyles.  If you liked Upstairs DownstaIrs you will love this series as well."
B009KH9XX4 The series ends with a cliff hanger that is never resolved, which is a big disappointment. Some episodes are very entertaining while others needed have to scripts revised. Overall it was I would a good series but on where near the level of Upstairs Downstairs where the characters came from."
B009KHBGWK I started watching this show because Monica Raymund was in the cast and, after watching all three seasons of &#34;Lie to Me&#34;, I think she's among the most provocatively beautiful, talented, and fascinating actors I've ever seen, but after watching &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; for most of season 1, I've given up because, apart from Raymund's Gabriela Dawson, for me there simply are no characters in the series who are interesting, likeable, or possible to care about, and more than a few are just plain aggravating - especially Taylor Kinney as the obnoxious Kelly Severide with Jesse Spencer, late of &#34;House&#34;, a pretty close second. This is really just a nighttime soap with the &#34;drama&#34; of fires added to give it what juice it has and that really isn't much. Eamonn Walker as the Chief is quite effective, but Charlie Barnett as Peter Mills is a ridiculous, puppy-like character who acts about 16. Others, of course, may well feel very differently, but I was very disappointed."
B009KHBGWK Nice product, of course it comes in wonderfully on Amazon Prime, however you need to watch the entire season because each episode hinges on the next and you never find out what happens without purchasing another episode. Its great if you purchased the whole season I guess."
B009KHBGWK I just found  this series and bought the  season 1 pass. It was so good I watched the entire season this weekend. I willbuy all the remaining seasons. This show has the best cast on TV today"
B009KHBGWK Note: I have seen every episode of this series in HD via XFinity On Demand.From the creator of Law And Order (and its subsequent spinoffs) comes a well-written and well-acted drama about firefighters in Chicago. The characters, with the exception of Shay as a lesbian (which undesirable quality, thankfully, is written out after several episodes, and which perversion is thankfully not shown in more than 1 or 2 episodes, though it were better had it not been depicted at all), are well-developed, and the storylines are very detailed. My only gripes, are, as I mentioned above with one, Shay being depicted as a lesbian and she is shown kissing her female partner in two or three episodes (really disgusting, gratuituous and unBiblical), and the fat idiot known as mouch asking Casey not to report Cruz to Boden. I never really cared for mouch, but this act of his (and for some half-baked reason, Casey listening to him) really made me despise him more, and i hoped he (mouch) would die in the season finale. hopefully, he'll die in season 2, though. Thankfully, Shay's lesbo partner goes to New York after two or three episodes of them being together (the kissing bits between them were so unneccessary and absolutely gratuituous).Season II begins this Fall on NBC."
B009KHBGWK I bought this series for my wife not believing I'd watch it. I missed the first couple of episodes but happened to watch an early one and was soon hooked by the excellent writing, the great cast of characters and the drama.I've been particularly surprised by the level of emotion the show evokes. The writers sure know how to create moments of exhilaration and others that pull on your heart strings.My wife and I are eagerly awaiting the arrival of season 2 in 2014."
B009KHBGWK Lots of pretty faces, plots are a little slow in the first two episodes but they pick up after that!  The acting is well done, the characters are well done by the actors.  I suggest that this not be watched by anyone under the age of 18, some scenes are pretty graphic!"
B009KHBGWK The series premiere thrusts viewers right into the thick of things, as firefighter Andy Darden has just been killed in the line of duty. Both Casey and Severide blame one another, and the death has rocked the confidence and morale of 51 in general. Meanwhile, Casey finds himself the target of a dirty cop's wrath after Casey refuses to cover for the officer's son in a drunk-driving accident that left another person paralyzed.There's never a dull moment, either professionally or personally, at Chicago's Firehouse 51. Led by Lieutenants Matt Casey (Jesse Spencer) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney), under the direction of Chief Wallace Boden (Eamonn Walker), the firefighters at 51 are called to the scene for everything from apartment fires to train derailments to gang crossfire.Rounding out the crew at 51 are also paramedics Gabriela Dawson (Monica Raymund) and Leslie Shay (Lauren German); experienced firefighters Christopher Herrmann (David Eigenberg), Joe Cruz (Joe Minoso), &#34;Otis&#34; (Yuri Sardarov) and &#34;Mouch&#34; (Christian Stolte), as well as candidate/trainee Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett). The group frequently interacts with Dawson's brother, Det. Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda). a narcotics investigator who is often the means of gaining crucial information from the police department.On a personal level, Casey and his longtime girlfriend, Dr. Hallie Thomas (Teri Reeves) struggle to reconcile their differences regarding children, while Severide tries to hide a serious injury that is impacting his ability to do his job properly. Dawson struggles with her longtime crush on Casey; Cruz discovers his younger brother is part of a gang. Mills is anxious to become a full-fledged firefighter, following in the footsteps of his father who was killed on the job, while his mother is desperate to change his mind.And those are just a FEW of the longer-running storylines! In just this first season, viewers are also regaled with a character's mother being paroled from prison (for killing his father); pregnancies, gang activity, traumatic brain injury, and numerous near-death experiences of various kinds. Many of these stories are introduced as rather intense, but so quickly resolved that it truly takes away from how well the story is told. Or, even worse, some of the stories are introduced, indicated as extremely pertinent to the character(s)...and then dropped, never to be heard about again. Almost moments later, the next crisis hits 51, and the next, and the next.Fortunately, the show seems to find a better pace toward the end of the first season, and definitely from the start of Season 2. This way, viewers can more fully enjoy and appreciate the storytelling, as well as the character development, than when it's all rushing past like the men to the scene of a fire."
B009KHBGWK I am a huge Dick Wolf fan. So when I heard he was making this show, I got really excited! I tuned in to the first episode, and the first episode is slow, but it gets way way better! It is the best new show of the 2012-2013 tv season!"
B009KHBGWK I love the characters and how they work so well with each other. It has had me guessing several times about the relationships."
B009KHBGWK I think it's as good as third watch was......... And I like the cast. I like tha Batln. Chief. I always enjoy a good TV series about the Fire Dept. And Police Dept.."
B009KHBGWK This Show is wonderful! It has a Great Young but very experienced cast with people from other great shows like the Wire to House to Shameless on it! They all shine, even the actors i was not familiar with!The Stories are not just about a series of Fires either like shows of this ilk usually are. Their are episodes about the firefighters personal lives, People getting shot, car accidents, great fire scenes and even Love scenes that are not \"Flakey!\" Bad cops, Good cops, Drug addiction and so much more.I would certainly watch this show if you have not seen it. It`s a wonderful piece of work."
B009KHBGWK This show is very good. Has a lot of fire fighting and is realistic. The actors are realistic also. Very good show."
B009KHBGWK A diverse group of characters and all have special qualities.  Hope to see a second season to learn the outcome of so many cliffhangers."
B009KHBGWK I like to watch shows that include what goes on in the world(ok, nationwide)that is somewhat real. Also that is a bit realistic that reminds us of &#34;real&#34; people and what they go through."
B009KHBGWK I love watching this show every week and I like to be able to download and watch if I miss it! I love it!"
B009KHBGWK Traditional take on a tried and true genre.  Guilty pleasure?  Definitely.  What's wrong with watching beautiful firefighters & paramedics take on super tense situations and leave us with fantastic (albeit slightly predictable) cliffhangers?  I really enjoy the show - it's like drinking that first cup of coffee every morning!  Aaaahhhh...."
B009KHBGWK I viewed this show from all the commercials and was pleasantly surprised at how good it is . I am hooked."
B009KHBGWK Love this show... actors, stories, action.  Holds my interest for the whole show.  I hate to miss even one episode"
B009KHBGWK I really like that the fire house story line is blended with a bit of humor, and the script is not simply &#34;house on fire.&#34; There are many types of rescue and plenty of tension."
B009KHBGWK So dark and depressing. Awful because of the rampant promiscuity as well. Your all going to get vd and stds."
B009KHBGWK What a great drama this series is, I love all the characters and that it has an Aussie in it  just makes it better, never thought the fire department could be so exciting."
B009KHBGWK This is a very exciting, thrilling show.  Nice to have it available online as I had missed most of the season from regular TV."
B009KHBGWK It has a great, solid cast, with sexy leads and good, complicated but believable relationships. Love the captain of the firehouse."
B009KHBGWK I will admit that when I first heard of this show, I was only interested in watching it because Jesse Spencer was going to be on it. We loved him on &#34;House&#34; and are just big fans of his. We watched the first episode and fell in love with thw show! Every character on this show is so likeable. Each week has been a thrill ride. At the end of each show, you find yourself wishing it was next week already so you can see what's next. It's very believable and entertaining! I have a 13 year old and a 6 year old who can't stop watching each episode over and over (we DVR it too so that they can watch it over and over). We startted watching because of Jesse Spencer and we LOVE Matt Casey, but we have fallen in love with all the characters. Always great stroylines and action...we higly recoomend it, it is by far one of the best shows on TV."
B009KHBGWK I love it because I'm a healthcare junkie. I've been in for the last twenty two years and this reminds me of work. This show is great joy to me thank you."
B009KHHELW I love love love duck dynasty. They are funny and entertaining and I love them like they were my own family. While some of their views aren't the same as mine, they are entitled to their opinions and I love how they stay true to their convictions and their way of life. Money definitely did not change them."
B009KHHELW My family and I enjoy watching {and laughing} Duck Dynasty!! Great morals!"
B009KHHELW In a word,  YES.  In fact, I am waiting for a cookbook from Miss Kay, so I can learn how to do frogs legs, and not pay premium dollars for them in a resturant.These people, whether they are practiced or fully tv novices, are the funniest comedians on tv!  The sight of Si telling children about VietNam on career day in season one, while Phil skinned and cleaned a critter for the high school class, had me careening off the walls in hysterical laughter.  And Pa going fishing with Luke and his date, then having them clean and gut the fish, was fall out of my chair funny.These millionaire Rednecks, camo, guns and duck calls, lure you into their world, and, if its true or exaggerated, totally enthrall with their ideas, interests, and devotion to family, and to God.Duck Dynasty: Season 1 - Sneak Peek"
B009KHHELW Always makes me laugh. Not many comedies on TV can claim that fame for me. Love the lesson sum up at the end."
B009KHHELW Thoroughly enjoyed these silly people. I hope A&E; doesn't keep the patriarch Phil Robertson off, when I researched and read the non cherry-picked comments he made in the full GQ article, he said nothing anyone should be offended by. Tolerance works on both sides. I believe in religious freedom as long as you're not deliberately trying to harm others with it.The buffers they didn't print:&#8220;My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together,&#8221;  But I would &#8220;never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me.&#8221;&#8220;We never, ever judge someone on who&#8217;s going to heaven, hell,&#34; Robertson said in a less-quoted passage from the GQ piece. &#34;That&#8217;s the Almighty&#8217;s job. We just love &#8217;em, give &#8217;em the good news about Jesus&#34;&#34;I love all men and women&#34; Robertson said &#34;I am a lover of humanity, not a hater.&#34; When a member of the class thanked Robertson for saying what he said in the interview, he appeared to shrug it off, saying &#34;I didn&#8217;t think much of it at all, but it seems a lot of other people did.&#34;I would worry more about some religions who's laws say to execute homosexuals, rather than nitpick on people with traditional Christian values who get harrassed for them more than the people who claim to be victims."
B009KHHELW These guys are hilarious but they keep to their religious views at the end of the day."
B009KHHELW I grew up in the woods too. It reminds me of good times with family, and fun times with my brother before political correctness became vogue. It is hilariously funny because I can relate to the way the guys deal with situations on the show. My cousins, brother, and friends tease like they do on the show.People now, seem to take themselves way too seriously, and this show is refreshing because they kid, tease, and have fun. Then at the end of the day everybody remembers WHO is really to be taken seriously (Jesus)."
B009KHHELW Duck Dynasty is one of our favorite programs, and Season 2 was no exception.  Stupid and funny as usual.  What else can I say?"
B009KHHELW So great to have a fun show to watch with kids and grandkids!!  There are so few shows out there worth watching!"
B009KHHELW I bought this, because season one was awesome, and I do not have cable, because I do not like most of the junk on now days"
B009KHHELW I watched this show, right up until Phil's interview with GQ. How can anyone, ANYONE, claim that African Americans were &#34;happy, happy, happy&#34; under the Jim Crow laws? How can anyone, ANYONE, be so hateful about people who identify as LGBT? I will never watch again. Feel free to hate on this review. Just because some people agree with him doesn't make it right."
B009KHHELW I just love this show. Wish I didn't have to pay to see the rest. As his daddy would say HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY."
B009KHHELW Entertaining and pure Americana .  Probably the best program on the air .  I hope they continue for a few more years."
B009KHHELW Great Family entertainment. This show is always funny and keeps the humor clean."
B009KHHELW Duck Dynasty is entertaining, and wholesome, but I'm not sure it is profitable in any way.  The characters are so much different from most people that it's hard to relate."
B009KHHELW The pilot episode is funny because its audacious and over-the-top redneckery, but shortly thereafter it becomes a droll, uninteresting show about this stupid family of fakes pretending to be beverly hillbilly like backwoodsmen, new to fame and fortune because of a popular duck call, having fun in their hemi trucks and shiny new carharrrrrrt attire.  I would have a real problem with the publicly bigotted statements if it weren't simply a pandering to an audience of morbidly obese neckertown walmartians and a  false flag of 'any-publicity-even-negative-is-publicity-nonetheless' as a dubious means to perpetuate a WELL overplayed merchandising campaign at Walmart that is as stupid as the people who buy into it."
B009KHHELW Love Duck Dynasty. Wholesome show. Totally fun to watch. Appropriate for kids. Makes me want to go outdoors and hike more"
B009KHHELW I love this show because of all the characters in it, but especially when I hear Phil say we all bow and he prays at dinner , it brings tears of joy to my eyes. I love the Lord and I love to see it on TV, so must a lot of other Americans. Glad this show is on TV"
B009KHHELW The first season was fun, but I've been losing interest in this highly scripted &#34;reality&#34; series.  This may still be highly interesting to 13-year-old kids, but as a guy a bit older than Si, the writing just seems aimed at more of a Three Stooges audience."
B009KHHELW These to are old reruns that everybody has seen, this is why they too are free with Amazon Prime. Also the sound works with this, even though it is old."
B009KHHELW Certain episodes are comic relief, that's for sure. The amazing thing is there are actually people in the world like these guys, and that's scary knowing so. If you want a good laugh it's worth watching."
B009KHHELW Duck Dynasty is a great family fun television show to watch!! It is good ole clean FUN!!!! I absolutely love it!!!"
B009KHHELW If you have heard the hype about this show but have not watched it yet...just watch it! You will be hooked just like the rest of us!"
B009KHHELW I love Duck Dynasty especially when they end the day with prayer.  The only show I had to walk away from was when they went frog hunting.  Has Sadie gotten her license to drive yet?  She is a beautiful young woman but keep an eye on her at all times.  Boy out there are preditors.  I love to hear them talk.Keep all the little girls safe."
B009KHHELW These guys are funny, wish there was more hunting though, they kinda just call each other idiots and do red neck bits, good stuff though, worth the watch."
B009KHHELW JASE IS THE SEXY STAR, CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIM; HOWEVER THE OTHERS ARE ALL VERY GOOD AND FUNNY.I LIKE THE PRAYER BEFORE THEIR MEALS."
B009KHHELW very funny and interesting.  My husband really enjoys watching the videos and keeps watching as long as there are more of them"
B009KHHELW poor little millionaires making even more money on the idiots that care about duck dynasty's daily lives!  reality TV is the worst!"
B009KHHELW I liked this season just as much as the first season. It was great! Keep it up. We all have our favorite people on the show, but regardless its great their family is so tight knit. That is something for us all to make happen."
B009KHHELW Hey, look here, Jase and Si are funny, funny, funny. Love the prayer at the end of most shows.  I see myself in this family."
B009KHHELW My whole family, young and old, like this program.  It's just good clean fun.  One of the few programs that my husband and our grandson can sit and watch together."
B009KHHELW Great for the whole family. Hilarious redneck twist on normal everyday life. Absolutely love the moral and prayer at the end of each episode. Should have more shows like this!"
B009KHHELW They are wealthy fakes pretending to be good old boys.  Cops was an excellent reality show because it was not fake!  Now they make fake junk like this and call it reality, but this has nothing to do with reality.  It's amazing how the sheep suck up this BS.  Also, the claim about them being religious is perverted version of religion.  The story goes that God created man in his own image.  Not in any bible does it say &#34;white&#34; men only, so how can racist bigots like these guys be considered religious?  It's completely FAKE garbage!"
B009KHHELW I love, love, love this show! But then, I tend to be politically incorrect and so are they! They make me happy, happy, happy! Just wish more seasons were available on Amazon Prime!"
B009KHHELW All the seasons are great! No profanity, no inuendos, family values, funny. A great series. A show that is worth watching."
B009KHHELW It will make you happy happy happy to watch this gang of good old boys from Louisiana get up to tricks again while attempting to run their business.good watching for the whole family."
B009KHHELW Great show!  It is fun and has great family values.  We stream these over and over on Amazon Prime. Highly recommend this show."
B009KHHELW i love the show and  they have become so popular and I get a kick out of akll of them"
B009KHHELW This show sort of grows on you. At first it seems as if it is all about the money but these guys do seem to have a moral compass; though sometimes it's not till supper time that it shows. Recommend for all (even us poor people). LOL."
B009KHHELW Do not believe all the rave reviews.  They're  all from family members and die hard fans who don't want to see these bird killers go.  It's time to close the curtains on this lame show already."
B009KHHELW This is a fun show for the whole family. It teaches some good morals and doesn't take anything too seriously. It is contrived and unbelievable at times but it's still good to see a family staying together even when things don't go well."
B009KHHELW We enjoy watching these redneck guys and their antics on this show.  All I can say is it's a good thing &#34;the boys&#34; work for their brother because I don't think they could make it in the real world with a different job.  It seems like they goof off 90% of the time but then again, how much fun would the show be if they just sat around in a warehouse and made duck calls?  I'm sure they get paid for the TV show on top of endorsements and what they make working there.  Sure wish I had a cushy job like that!"
B009KHHELW It is different from other shows in that this family is both modern and old school when it comes to their lifestyle. It is like the Beverly Hillbilly's built their mansion on their own land where they hit oil and are living out in the woods. A very unique blend of country living, family roots that go back generations with some cash and modern day society thrown into the mix to interfere with the natural order of things. Si is just a naturally funny guy and I can see why everyone in the family loves him."
B009KHHELW My family has had a great time watching this show. The girls get grossed out quite a bit, but it is real life at its fullest.Own your land and hunt on it. Always cook what you hunt.It is also funny had the gentlemen interact."
B009KHHELW another son favorite very intresting he must really love it cause he has gotten 2 seasons try you might like"
B009KHHELW Love this show very entertaining, great characters and they make you laugh, quite the sibling rivalry as well and an uncle who is a real redneck."
B009KHHELW I  watched this show one episode after another, and just got the biggest laugh and enjoyed every minute! I plan to buy all the seasons!!"
B009KHHELW This show cracks me up.  It's nice to watch a reality show that isn't all about DRAMA.  This show is light hearted and very ridiculous at times.  I like the values that the cast sticks to no matter the situation and how they end every episode together as a family.  Not as much hunting and fishing in this season as the first one but still as good.  Really enjoyed it!  Can't wait for Amazon to put Season 3 on Prime."
B009KHHELW Hey, looky here Jack. They's all good rednecks. I believe most of my small town stays home to watch each episode. What's special about this show is the family values."
B009KHHELW Love the characters and the way they are developed. Love the rags to riches theme also! Looking forward to watching the whole season!"
B009KOE4ZO Don't waste your time on this movie. The first 40 minutes of it is about stupid kids and their crappy life, parties and other B.S. The rest of it (until the titles start rolling) is based on a very bad plot, with unlikable actors, and average special effects made with nowadays available for everybody, programs. The after titles last minute of the movie was without any scare or whatsoever. Don't believe what the trailer or the cover says. It is NOT! twice as scary as the first movie. It is far worse! I was bored through all of it! Stupid, pathetic, shameless movie! That is all I have to say. Nice attempt to make money! Now I would like to get payed for watching this garbage!"
B009KOE4ZO Alex and his fellow film school friends receive a mysterious video link that suggests the frightening images from the GRAVE ENCOUNTERS film may have been for real. The group gathers their cameras and heads out to the old insane asylum where the film was originally shot to investigate, only to fall victim to the same insatiable spirits! GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 shares all of the first film's weaknesses without finding any of its strengths. At first, it seems like the makers may be parodying the \"found-footage\" genre just as they had done with the popular ghost hunting TV shows from before. By the end of the the first act, however, we come to the frightening realization that the atrocious acting, idiotic characters, and recycled plot points are all being taken seriously. The story borrows generously from Dave Parker's THE HILLS RUN RED with a touch of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY as John Poliquin and the Vicious Brothers prove to us that they have nothing new to bring to the table in this second installment. The same cheap effects and obnoxious scare tactics are employed once more, but what is the point of using the \"found-footage\" format when the images on screen are exaggerated to such an extreme? It then becomes impossible to accept any of the footage as being \"authentic,\" thereby destroying the illusion and rendering the film a complete failure. A little subtlety goes a long way, which is a lesson that the makers of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS have yet to learn.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
B009KOE4ZO Very well done sequel that adds on to the first one and the mythos of the building. I loved the whole plot about this as some youtube kid reviews the movie and then finds out about some cover up involving the first film as it actually happened and goes to investigate it. I loved the first one and this one I think is just as good so I say you need to check this out if your a fan of horror movies or ghot type movies."
B009KOE4ZO I was a little worried at first, but once this film gets going (fairly early, thankfully), it becomes a \"nail biter\" and \"edge of your seat\" presentation! What's real and not real? Halfway through it, you really don't care, since it certainly all SEEMS real. For older teen audiences and adults, G.E. 2 may just have you jumping out of your seat! Best viewed with the lights out and holding someone's hand."
B009KOE4ZO The effects when they occur are spooky. The story and the acting are only mediocre. Good for a late night scare."
B009KOE4ZO Again, let me offer up this defense before I go any further: I'm not opposed to the whole `found footage' phenomenon.  As I've said, I think there's a spark of brilliance behind every one of these films.  If there's any fault to this entire movement, it's that too many stories that would be better served and received by being built as a regular feature (meaning NOT as a found footage vehicle) are, instead, being done on the fast and the cheap by taking this somewhat easy-way-out.  Still, if the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise teaches us anything, it's that \"if you build it, people will come\" ... so settle in for the long haul, society.  It looks like `found footage' is here to stay.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)I didn't see the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS, so I'm only going on what I've been able to ascertain from some quick reading; but it looks like that 2011 flick tapped a vein: budgeted on a slick $1 million, it at least had legs strong enough to start a franchise, and it's second installment, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2, even garnered the embellishment of the Tribeca Film series, so that's none too shabby.  While the first feature explored what happened when the production crew of a ghost-hunting program actually ran afoul of real ghosts, the second tweaked the formula just a bit.Film student and horror enthusiast Alex Wright (played by Richard Harmon) believed that GRAVE ENCOUNTERS was a legitimate conspiracy released to audiences.  He contends that what happened in the \"film\" was actually a true story, but it was only \"marketed\" as a fictional film in order to get it before the masses.  Out to prove his point, he enlists the aid of his fellow classmates to scout out the real location of the original `encounters' so that they may probe the condemned psychiatric hospital for true spirits.  What he finds brings him face-to-face with some grim truths that might spell doom for those who joined him for such a personal haunting.This horror schlock is brought to you by the same team who did the first outing: the Vicious Brothers.  At a glance over on IMDB.com, it would appear this franchise is presently the only thing they have to their name, but, in their defense, there's enough charm, gore, and inspiration that I wouldn't be all that surprised to see more from them.  Granted, not every stone turned over here is all that original, but there's a pleasant enough mix of solid performances, predictable developments, and harmless scares that they're probably destined to do another one, at least, or launch some other screamer on unsuspecting audiences.What I didn't like was the blatant stupidity of so many of these characters.  Yes, I realize that a `working stupidity' kind of goes hand-in-hand with horror films.  But you would think that a group of young film nerds - ones who have made a college career out of mildly sending up the same genre with their own little pet projects - would know best what trips and traps to NOT fall into here.  Once they're deposited in the psychiatric hospital, all of what they knew before seems to vanish quicker than the first virgin (another horror film staple), and that's sad.  If they were so smart, why didn't they plan this all out better?  If they were so creative, why didn't they expect some of what awaited them?  If they truly believed everything in the first film was a legitimate spectral event, why wouldn't they have gone in better prepared than they did?I know, I know, I know.  It's a horror film, after all, and that's what suffices for a horror film in this day and age.  Put your brain on `pause' and you're liable to enjoy this one a bit more than I did.GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 is produced by Death Awaits Cinema, Twin Engine Films, and Pink Buffalo Films.  The film appeared as part of the Tribeca Film series.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As for the technical specifications, much of it looks and sounds solid, though there is some obvious distortion done deliberately due to the nature of the `found footage film' phenomenon; however, I didn't find any of it unusually distracting from the experience, though some muffled audio was tough to hear.  Sadly, there's only a single special feature; it's listed as \"An Interview with the Vicious Brothers,\" but it's essentially a 3-minute blurb about the film - I'm guessing it was almost what they said when they pitched this idea - and it's disappointing.RECOMMENDED only for fans of horror and/or found footage films.  Outside of the basic storytelling premise - that the Vicious Brothers kinda/sorta intended for this to be `respected' as a legitimate found footage flick - there's nothing new here.  As I've tried to be clear above, it's kinda/sorta sad that the whole `found footage phenomenon' has come full circle to the point now where fully realized stories that may've been better served by not being filmed this way (as `found footage') are still being churned out by an industry that apparently never heard a bad idea.  I think GRAVE would've been better constructed as a traditional horror film - the very ones it thumbs its nose at - but maybe that's just me.  Odds are that, if `found footage' is your thing, you might enjoy this one more than I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with an advance DVD screener of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 for the expressed purpose of completing this review."
B009KOE4ZO (Warning, this review contains some spoilers)I thought the first would help the producers realize their mistakes and improve on them. Fat chance.The initial shot has people raving about Grave Encounters and going loco about how good or bad it was and how some were convinced it really was real. One such raving fan goes to an alcohol-steeped party and (eventually) reveals that he's a @#%^#@$ visionary. My thought on that was \"Sure you're a visionary. I don't get your vision, though.\"His plan is to provide evidence that Grave Encounters was the true deal. Problem is... his obsession with the \"proof\" leads to problems with his girlfriend, friends, and, really, his whole life situation it seems. Between his own filmmaking (you're given snippets of his film, which is nothing but predictable shot after predictable shot) and finding what he needs, he's really letting himself loose on his psychosis.Just like in the first film, this goes to show you NEED to know how to make your ghost effects realistic. There was one singular shot where a creepy ghost did send chills down my spine. Then the ghost moved. End of the fear and the beginning of my eyes rolling.If there's anything I can say this movie did that did get my interest, it was the use of multiple types of cameras (iPhone, professional camera, B/W silent-era camera, etc.) to tell the story from different types of angles and get a sense of realism.The other was the return of a certain character from the first movie. Out of all the actors in this movie, his was hands-down the most believable. Pure craziness, from the shocking reveal to his last moment.Unfortunately, afterwards, it's all hedonism at its most horrorific. And it quickly got as disinteresting, bland, 1-dimensional, lackluster boring as it had been. Even when a cleaning lady is passing by the ghost hunting team, I'm quite certain the team didn't notice the look she gave them, which tipped off that something was going to happen. Before the elevator doors opened, I (unfortunately again) could predict what would happen. It defied physics, but it couldn't defy predictability? When will filmmakers today learn?Overall, despite the nice maneuver of using multiple cameras to some advantage and one character being believably looney, I only give this 1/5."
B009KOE4ZO I really enjoyed the original Grave Encounters and was thrilled to find there was a sequel.  It mimics the original story line without totally copying it and has it's own interesting twists.  If you liked the first, you'll like this one as well."
B009KOE4ZO Okay, as a fan of the original \"Grave Encounters\" - and it is one of the better entries in the increasingly-boring and overpopulated \"found footage\" genre - I decided to give this one a shot... One of the many times I wish I would actually heed my fellow reviewers' posts... I'm not going to say anything new about GE2 here because everybody just about hit the proverbial nail on the head... One poster said it best when he said that it appears that the Vicious Brothers have nothing new to bring to the table. Shame, because GE gave some credibility back to the genre. Only time will tell, I suppose..."
B009KOE4ZO FILMING STYLE: Grave Encounters 2 continues the found footage, first person POV filming style; shaky and candid.YouTube horror critic and college student Alex (Richard Harmon), who looks like Robert Pattinson less a few good-looking genes, sets out to make a great horror film.  During his endeavors, our freshman director receives some strange emails from a anonymous source with videos that seem to be &#34;extra&#34; scenes from the movie Grave Encounters.  Alex then believes that the events of Grave Encounters &#34;really happened&#34; and decides to prove it on film along with his friends Trevor (Dylan Playfair), Tessa (Stephanie Bennett), Jared (Howie Lai) and Jennifer (Leanne Lapp), who looks a bit like Amy Adams.The documentarians try to track down Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson), the host of Grave Encounters, to discover that he has not been heard of since filming Grave Encounters.  To get to the bottom of it all, they all decide to go to the abandoned hospital where Lance Preston and his team was last seen.  The dynamic: Trevor and Jared do most of the camera work, Tessa just seems to sit around and &#34;look pretty,&#34; and Alex has a crush on Jennifer.They sneak onto the property from Grave Encounters and, like the original Grave Encounters team, they set up cameras in the old asylum which is now peppered with police crime scene tape.  From this point, Grave Encounters is basically re-imagined with a new crew and a slightly different goal, but the same sets.  Their documentarians recap the events from Grave Encounters and then semi-duplicate the original team's actions, encounter the same situations and similar things happen to them.  In some ways, it almost feels like a remake/re-imagining for  a portion of the film.The story suffers toward the end as Grave Encounters 2 tries to tie together elements from both movies.  But I didn&#8217;t let that ruin the movie for me.  The whole product was a few steps down from the quality of the original, but I enjoyed it for all the same reasons.Most damning to the story was that once Alex and his crew decide that the Grave Encounters footage is real, they never once acknowledge that means that ghosts exist!  They're simply hellbent on proving that the footage is real.  Even when they arrive to the site where it all happened, they're in no way concerned about the poltergeists they saw kill some of the crew on camera in Grave Encounters!!!  But, like the original, the movie is funny, decently acted, sets a creepy mood and has its share of scares.While a B-version of the original, Grave Encounters 2 entertained me and even did so when I came in with bad expectations.Monitor your expectations and give this film a chance.  It may shock you, too."
B009KOE4ZO Grave Encounters 2 is a found-footage film that follows Alex, an aspiring filmmaker; Alex, who recently posted a negative review for \"Grave Encounters\", begins to receive eerie messages that have him questioning the original film's authenticity. Alex eventually believes the film is real, and convinces his friends to travel with him to the Grave Encounters' shooting location, a mental hospital, to get proof. Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept, but lacks the essential horror elements (terror, suspense, atmosphere, etc.)The story in Grave Encounters 2 is interesting; I know this concept has been done before, but it's not something that's been overdone, so I was genuinely interested. The execution, however, was poor. The film uses the first 30 minutes or so to build up the mystery and introduce/develop the characters. A horror film with build-up and characters? Great! However, the build-up/mystery in this film is very dull since it lacks suspense and creepiness, and the characters aren't actually deep, despite spending a third of the film learning about them- we see the surface of the characters, and they're irritable and illogical. So, the first act of the film is basically useless backstory that could've been told more efficiently.The rest of the film takes place in the mental hospital. Again, the tension is absent throughout the film; this makes the jump-scares ineffective, except for 1 or 2. Most of the film is the group walking into a room, seeing something paranormal and being chased out; running from room to room, you'd think you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo. I won't spoil the final third of the film, but it's actually somewhat decent; the explanation is twisted and somewhat unique; I'm sure there are a few hardcore Grave Encounter fans that will enjoy it. I'm not saying it's the greatest finale, but it adds to the dull atmosphere/tone of this film. My final complaint for the mov
B009KOE4ZO If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film \"Grave Encounters,\" they're hoping you'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled \"Grave Encounters 2.\"  Utilizing the increasingly popular \"found footage\" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, \"Grave Encounters\" was a reasonably effective (if not spectacularly original) entry into the horror arena.  It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go-to genre of filmmaking, so it's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack.  This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story.  And it is just so tired already!  But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer, found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience.  I may not have hated \"Grave Encounters 2\" as much as some--but after a reasonably promising set-up, the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic (and ill conceived) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie.  A film student (Richard Harmon) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not.  As any remarkably sane person would do, he assembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior.  Even if everything is real (which he believes), his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival.  There isn't much more to tell without revealing spoilers.  I'll just say that the introduction (which takes a VERY LONG time) is handled well enough, but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise.  Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second, and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film. Here, The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision.  This movie presupposes that you've seen the original.  Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone, the finale will lose some of its impact.  But maybe that's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far.  If you remember the stylistic differences between \"Blair Witch\" and its abysmal sequel, some of the same mistakes were made here.  It's almost too meta, too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own.  And with the choices made in the conclusion, it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me.  KGHarris, 3/13."
B009KOE4ZO I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times. For me it hit every note exactly right. Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds, the usual problem with most sequels.If you haven't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters' type program that we find is more staged than reality. In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they're placed in a body bag. It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film. Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex. When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own. The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along. The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering. But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in. When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard's death. Frightened and unable to leave, the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did. It's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film, the host of the show, who has been trapped here for years. Can they escape with his help even though he hasn't been able to all this time?That's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film. The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen. But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I don't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture. It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story. Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time (no pun intended) prior it isn't worth it. Sorry but I can't recommend this movie to anyone, including fans of the first film."
B009KOE4ZO This sequel starts off promising with a series of bloggers discussing the authenticity of the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS...sort of a parody within a parody.  One blogger, an aspiring filmmaker, believes the found footage is real, and wants to go to the hospital to prove it.  Ironically, this novice director is working on a slasher movie, another overworked genre.  Anyway, the first half of GE2 looks like a potentially effective sequel, but the appearance of a character from the original film sends the movie on a downward spiral it doesn't recover from.The Vicious Brothers wrote the script but didn't direct this time.  It's disappointing to see a potentially good sequel disintegrate so easily.  Let's hope this ends the franchise."
B009KOE4ZO I'll start by saying I found Grave Encounters to be boring with no scare factor at all. Actually, I don't get scared during movies, so let me correct that by saying the first one was pretty boring with no cool or fun scenes. However, some people loved it and thought it was pretty scary. I have to wonder if they watch scary movies enough to know what a decent horror flick is really like? After all, so many fans of the wrong genres flocked to Cabin In The Woods and claimed it was the scariest movie they had ever seen... pffftt, try watching Moonwalker next time.The intro of this movie shows a bunch of reviews to the first movie, where alot of people said not enough happened in it, which is something I agreed with. So this one here has gone all out to try and provide something happening every few minutes and not just bore you to death with people in the dark with flashlights afraid of their own reflections. The plot to this one is about a filmmaker kid who found the first movie pretty boring, until he does some investigating and wonders if it was a movie at all, or if it was real? He receives messages on his computer from someone called \"Death Awaits\" and gives him coordinates on where the run down asylum really is. After a boring 30-40 minutes of him and his dumb friends partying and looking for evidence, smoking bongs and getting drunk, the movie finally get's better about 5 minutes into when they arrive and break into the hospital at night to investigate what happened to the original cast from the first movie.Once inside, the group begin to experience the same sort of things as the group of the first movie, only it looks better, happens more often, and doesn't let silence and nothing overshadow the plot. In other words, it's a much faster paced film. So the first 30-40 mins are a bore, the middle is OK, but the end... once again it has an ending that doesn't really pay off as a great ending. Is it really the best they could come up with? Oh well, I guess we will be seeing GE3 soon then.Personally I liked it a lot better than the first. However, if long drawn out boredom and noises are your thing, you might prefer the first."
B009KOE4ZO The beginning was unnecessary but if you can ignore that, the rest was just a Spookfest. Not a Gorefest ladies and Gentleman, a Spookfest. The action once it starts doesn't let up at all.Its way better than part two in my opinion and very under-rated."
B009KOE4ZO While the first movie had the basic premise of doing a ghost hunting documentary the sequel makes the reference of that being a movie and trying to discern whether or not the site was truly haunting due to a viral video giving the first movie an iconic following. As these young college teens go tot the haunted site they try and convey on what they might find but when they get there they find out to their horror that the ghosts are real and horrific and now face the same trials that the first group did.  The movie mostly tries to use the same style the first movie did with the scares of moving items,sounds, and quick flashes of something at the corner of their eye.  While there are somewhat better effects in this sequel you don't quite get the same scare thrill as you did with the first most likely because you know what's going to happen. As expected with a cast of relatively unknowns the acting is mixed though for the most part pretty decent there a few in the cast who need a little more acting training before trying out for a movie.Yes you'll see a ghost here and there and a surprising reintroduction of a past character but for the most part they use the same tactics that were used in the first movie so for the scares don't expect to much of a difference. Still since I pretty much knew what the movie would most likely be like I still found it entertaining as a ghost documentary movie and if you keep your expectations of the movie leveled you'll probably find it enjoyable as well."
B009KOE4ZO Not as scarey as the tirst one, and it dragged on a little bit,but there were some cool scenes & a few made me jump.would recommend it to people who had seen the first onebecause otherwise anyone else could get easily confused about thestoryline."
B009KOE4ZO The first grave encounters I really enjoyed. Dont get me wrong the second 1 is o.k. But they sould left this film out, because the first was the best and the ending was fine. But you know how production companies do. If you liked the first, give it a try. You might like."
B009KOE4ZO The first thirty minutes of the film introduces the characters as wannabe horror film make Alex Wright (Richard Harmon) goes from movie critic skeptic to believing the first film, \"Grave Encounters\" is real. He locates the REAL asylum where the movie was filmed and goes there with his own crew to film people with unhinged mouths, tables moving, a girl being dragged across the floor...all the stuff we have seen before in found footage films. I am beginning to believe these things simply appear on cameras if you leave them out too long.You get tired of seeing Alex's face in the camera running his mouth. The beginning of the movie includes pixelated nudity and immature college pranks. There is a sweet \"1408\" twist in the middle of the film which makes it almost worth the view, at least that was the part I enjoyed as I didn't see it coming. The filming was done better, if that means anything. I suggest you jump to chapter 6 and start watching to prevent from getting bored. Seasoned horror film watchers might want to take a pass on this one. If you scare easy, go for it.Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief obscure video sex, no real nudity."
B009KT4TY0 been better in the past, but all-in-all a decent season... kind of getting stale though, to be honest.. same with big brother. :/"
B009KT4TY0 Not one of their best seasons, it's alright but other seasons are better.  Watch another season first before you waste your time on this one."
B009KT4TY0 (spoiler alert)I was delighted that the winners were a come from behind. My dream was always to try out for this show but it looks like I'll just have to be content with watching it. I like that there is very little back stabbing on this show. Having visited some of the places they go to, it is amazing what they see that I have missed. Good ideas for my next trips."
B009KT4TY0 Although I had my issues with some of the teams, it''s not often that I am truly shocked by the winner of TAR, which is what happened with this season."
B009KT4TY0 The Amazing Race has you on the edge of your seat, even if you've seen the season before, anticipating who's going to come in first on each leg, anticipating who's going to come in last on each leg, whether this is an elimination leg or not. My favorite parts of the series are when several teams think they're in last place, when, in fact, only one team is. The various tasks that the contestants perform are very interesting. Some of them remind me of Survivor tasks, only these are done all over the world. It's surprising who is good at the tasks and who is not. You can't anticipate who's going to take the lead on a certain task."
B009KZYJ62 I LOVE, LOVE LT. JOE KENDA.  HE HAS SUCH WIT AND GETS THEJOB DONE!!  I LOVE THE GUY WHO PLAYS HUNTER ON THESHOW.  I HOPE TO GET MORE!!"
B009KZYJ62 I really enjoy this show. It is the retelling of actual homicide investigations that has the added twist of having the case narrated by the actual detective who worked on helping to solve the case. It is clear, as you hear him talk, how important it was to speak for the dead and to take their loss of life, which in most cases was truly tragic and greedy, to heart. I like hearing how the case was solved, but I also like hearing the human side of becoming involved in a line of work that is so bruising to the soul...and to remain professional while not being afraid to show his empathy."
B009KZYJ62 It's one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of true crime shows.The way the stories is told is very suspenseful and gripping. I could never know who the killer was before the detective revealed it. Detective Joe Kenda has a good sense of black humor and a humanitarian side. When he says he is touched by his victims' death, I saw it in his eyes, face and voice.In \"A Killer Always Rings Twice\", the killer and the rapist killed the second victim right under the police's nose. It's so unbelievable that it sounds like a Hollywood movie."
B009KZYJ62 I know, I know, this is not what you would expect from a man like me, but this show is about real crimes in a single city in the United States. Broad brushstrokes of data can make you believe that we live in Disneyland compared to other places in the world and mini-series shows will make you think all of the U.S. is downtown Detroit.This series is a study of homicides over a thirty year period in a larger of cities that are found on the front range. What is surprising is that there are so many and varied ways to commit murder within the boundaries of Colorado Springs. What makes this show so interesting is Joe Kenda's pithy statements of the criminal and the criminal mind; Better than the show by the same name (Criminal Minds). One of my favorite statements he makes is \"there are some people who are so evil, that we must put them in a cage and never let them out.\"Watch this show and see what crimes against humanity look like. Listen to the narration and hear what good narrative sounds like."
B009KZYJ62 He does NOT suffer fools gladly.  He's so full of wit and wisdom.  There needs to be someone like him on every police force.  I wish more cops were like him.  He gets to the bottom of things and he comes to collect, and he will collect.  400 homicide cases solved - IMPRESSIVE."
B009KZYXKY At first glance, I was not sure what to make of this show. I did not know that it was made by the same folks as My Name is Earl, or I probably would have turned my attention to it sooner. I find that this series is really funny and light-hearted. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why we can get behind the kind but morally ambiguous family. The ending of the second season was a little much for me, but the main tie in is Sabrina and Jimmy's fate. This season has so far done an excellent job of keeping the humor from growing stale while maintaining the quirky nature of the characters and their relationships. I am glad I own my seasons, and I recommend them to anyone looking for a good laugh that will also make you go \"hmmm\", but not guilty.Part of you will think, \"I'm glad I'm not THAT family. They're screwed up!\" But a part of you will also say, \"I wish I had their ideals,\" granted not as much as the former. This shows how the relationship of family is stronger than material wealth, but that even those blessed with a lot get that family is more important. The divide isn't as distant as you might think.Great job, Raising Hope cast and crew, writers and director, and all involved! Keep these seasons coming!"
B009KZYXKY it's has it's moments, b
B009KZYXKY Maw Maw and gang sure do make my family laugh.  This excellent shows continues to spread joy and remind us of what is most important - your family."
B009KZYXKY I like this program, but love it because of Cloris Leachman, In my opinion she IS the show.  By having on guest stars, this is another bonus, otherwise I feel it's just so, so."
B009KZYXKY We LOVE Raising Hope!!  After the first season...  a real &#34;knee slapper&#34;....  I was wondering how they would continue to come up w/such entertaining story lines...  as in the beginning &#34;Hope&#34; is just an infant....  Somehow they've done it!... We never miss an episode."
B009KZYXKY For years now, I would see episode previews, advertising, etc. and think that I didn't have one ounce of interest in this show. Now I'm addicted. Last week I was sick and there was nothing that interested me to watch and I decided to give this show a try. I have watched all 3 seasons in 4 days and can't get enough. Not every episode is golden, but it surprisingly has great characters that I find endearing and laugh out loud dialogue. Yes, it can be crass at times, b
B009KZYXKY Once you have watched the first two seasons, this third season is a must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's zany humor that is so fun to watch."
B009KZYXKY Better than last season.  I was afraid once Jimmy and Sabrina got together the show would lose its center (like so many shows do when main characters hook up); but instead it just gets better and better."
B009L0H5OY It is just a fun show to watch.  My wife and I enjoy it for the plots and the comedy."
B009L0H5OY I really like this show!  The characters are so funny!  This show is definitely worth watching if you are sick of crime shows."
B009L0H5OY I just discovered this show by accident with the season 3 finale on CW.  I loved the show so much I had to get the DVDs for past seasons.  All the actors are entertaining and charming.  It's a great show."
B009L0H5OY This show became one of my new favorites in the first season and I was very excited about the second.  The season started out strong but a little more than half way through their was some backsliding not just in the show plot but in the characters.  The first half of the season was great.  Zoe made a choice between George and Wade and embarked on an adult relationship and seemed to be growing as a person as did her chosen guy and many other characters.  I looked forward to the show every week until the middle of the season when everything changed.  Zoe's relationship was over all of the sudden in the span of 2 episodes and Zoe went back to being the immature woman who makes stupid choices that she almost instantly regrets.  It was the first half of the first season all over again.  I get that the writers and producers need to shake things up sometimes to keep a show interesting, but that is not what they did.  They turned it all over on its head and not in a good way.  The season thankfully ends on a high note that gives great hope for season 3.  For everyone else who loves this show, don't give up yet.  Hopefully the writers and producers will realize their mistake and go back to the way it was before."
B009L0H5OY Cute & fun show without all the seriousness that most dramas has now days where you need a flow chart to figure stuff out. Definitely looking forward to having this show added to my DVD collection. Adored Rachel Bilson from her The O.C. days so was excited about this new show of hers on one of my favorite networks. Little did I know I was about to be smitten by the entire cast who are all adorable. The list of quirky characters keep growing & I keep on enjoying. One show I don't mind buying to help promote it because its on a night that's completely complicated with scheduling conflicts."
B009L0H5OY I love rooting for him and the twinkle in his eyes is such a turn on. And, when he is vulnerable he melts my heart.  I have even come to like Lemon and her Dad. Great  show, I enjoy every minute of it."
B009L0H5OY I love watching Hart of Dixie.  They capture the heart of a small town and the southern belles to a T!  Great characters and writing!"
B009L0H5OY I really love this series!  It is much better than reading a book!  My husband even likes this show.  It is so typical of small town life with a bit extra added in for good measure.  What a way to end the work day! I could not wait until I could see the next episode!!!"
B009L0H5OY First season was a nice, somewhat innocent, and enjoyable fish outta water story; but the second season is just about characters bed hopping and using each other."
B009L0H5OY Having said all of that in my title, I watch this goof ball show anyway...I love the Southern accents, the gorgeous clothes the girls wear, and the mess all the characters make of their personal lives! Lavonne is my favorite, and coming in a close second is Lemon!!! Hope these two work it out and live happily ever after."
B009L0H5OY &#34;Hart of Dixie&#34; is an entertaining little show. I started watching by way of Netflix and then moved on to Amazon for the second season. If you have not tried Amazon Instant Video, give it a try, you will be glad you did."
B009L0H5OY This is a fun show to watch. The plot does not often stay true to it's course. Nevertheless I do enjoy the show because the characters seem to have fun with the show. I usually enjoy romantic comedies. They have to be really bad to get less than three stars form me."
B009L0H5OY Gets you involved in the characters and manages to have fun with with the South without being overly stereotypical or condescending."
B009L0H5OY I didn't expect to enjoy this show but having watched the first season, I was very happy to continue the &#34;Dixie&#34; experience in season 2.This is so watchable with some good believable characters and story lines.With so many &#34;dark&#34; viewing options available to be able to sit back and relax with this light, entertaining and wholesome TV is a wonderful treat. I'm very much looking forward to season 3."
B009L0H5OY The Hart of Dixie Series is amazing, it has a great story line. There is comedy, love, romance, and great characters that have a wonderful sense of humor."
B009L0H5OY Zoe Hart is back and is as funny as ever. The hostage scene (not to give anything away) was hilarious."
B009L0H5OY It's better every week. Zoe needs someone like Wade....they are funny together & they get one another. Poor George needs to find his own woman & forget about Zoe & Lemon."
B009L0H5OY It will be really sad if this wonderful series becomes known as just a \"chick series\".This program features some of the best writing seen in any network series. The characters draw you in. You come to care about these people.Especially enjoyable are the supporting cast. These fine folks add a richness rarely seen in contemporary television."
B009L0H5OY I don't know what it is about this show but whenever I am feeling stressed out, wrung out, played out, you get the idea, I watch Hart and Dixie and from the opening credits, just feel better.  If I were to speculate as to why?  The story telling, the setting, the characters, all contribute to a general sense of settled well-being.  It took me forever to finally watch this show but now that I do, I find it a perfect tonic against the stresses of being alive in 2013."
B009L0H5OY The first season of the show had a Doc Hollywood, fish out of water feel to it, which was part of what made the show good.  They abandoned that theme (mostly) in season 2, and made it a show about love triangles and love quadrilaterals.  While the show still is tongue in cheek and kept the feel of not taking itself too seriously, I do think it missed something by having Zoe more assimilated into the lifestyle.  It just had a lot more of soap opera feel to it.  I do like that they gave more of the ancillary characters bigger parts in season 2, although some of the characters from season 1 did not return.Chances are there is not going to be a lot of people in the gray area about liking or disliking the show.  If you cannot accept the fact that Rachel Bilson does not look like a doctor, or that the town probably reflects little to nothing about what a real southern town of that size, or that everyone has mostly perfect lives, then you will probably hate the show.  If you are willing to look past that and take for granted that it is not meant to be that serious and realistic and see it for what it is, you will probably like it.As for the DVD set itself, it is nothing all that special.  Just the episodes.  There are no extras, commentary or featurettes.  So if you only get DVDs for the extras you may want to skip getting these and just steam series."
B009L0H5OY I realize Alabama is a lot further south than Virginia but sometimes the accents are over the top but fun stories and characters."
B009L0H5OY This is just good fun. Silly and addicting. I find that I end up watching 3 or 4 episodes a night and then can't wait for thenext season."
B009L0H5OY This has become one of my favorite tv series. The people in this town never seem to really work and there are all these town events that everyone is involved in.  Its funny and a great escape after a hard day at work.  I can hardly wait until next season comes out."
B009L0H5OY I didn't think I would like this when I started watching Series 1 but I really did. The characters have a lot of depth to them and really hook you in. The story is light hearted and fun. I'm through season two now."
B009L0H5OY I love this series because it shows the southern culture the way it should be instead of how it really is.  It would be wonderful if it would be OK to have a black mayor who has relationships with white women and no one cares.  People also seem to really care about each other in this fictional small town with none of the small town gossip or mean-spirited class conflict."
B009L0H5OY We do not have cable and I usually watch this program the next day on line.  Downloaded it to my Kindle Fire because I missed it."
B009L0H5OY I just discovered this brilliant show via Netflix and like others had to come here to purchase this seasons episodes which are not on streaming.  As soon as I find a show that isn't filled with gore and revenge and cynicism, I discover it is about to be cancelled.  When will TV executives understand the market they are facing?I rate this show up there with classics like MASH and Northern Exposure.  In fact, Northern Exposure in the Hart of Dixie hits the nail on the head.  Can someone please offer me a job in Hollywood which is all about helping executives make the right decisions about programming, promotion and renewal?"
B009L0H5OY the first few episodes were phun to watch ; city girl in the souther world . a lot of fun , but all too soon became a &#34;payton place&#34; of the southern belle world ; sex swapping faster than one can change shoes ....  still are some funny and insteresting moments, yet all too quickly , zoe is out of the office and the youthful head-games begin and STUPID reigns . actors are good thru-out , but story and plot lines &#34;HOOVER&#34; . watch on TV first b/4 you buy"
B009L0H5OY The show is awesome!  I like how the stories are told and the characters are interesting and you get invested in Blue Belle!  The quality of the streaming is sometimes spotty but that could be due to internet connection."
B009L0H5OY This is good entertainment and good comedy. A fish-out-of-water story, it juxtaposes stereotypical southern cultural imagery prevalent among \"Yankees\" with New York City, \"innocent\" sophistication.  Rachel Bilson, a first rate comic actress, plays Zoe Hart, M.D., the New York City transplant in Bluebell, Alabama, who is in some measure sophisticated, but completely unsophisticated about southern rural culture. Except for George Tucker, the town lawyer who lived for a time in New York, the southerners have their own image of what one might expect from a New Yorker crashing into their insular life. The writers polish their comedy with unexpected but knowing and erudite observations by the locals in Bluebell, which giving oral bold relief through the southern drawl undercuts the northern cultural stereotype of the rural south as populated with unsophisticated rednecks and does so with humor. For example, Rose, Dr. Zoe Hart's teenage friend in commenting on Dr. Hart's resume on an on-line dating site exclaims \"its four pages long; it looks like one of those manifestos the FBI finds on a serial killer's laptop.\" She goes on, that these guys \"would rather play Dr. than date one.\" Watch it and you will understand what I mean."
B009L46WWQ I'm really enjoying this glimpse into the Kilcher family's 600+ acre homestead and their self sufficient lifestyle in the Alaskan wilderness. Very interesting how they originally came to be there. Eighty years ago the first Kilcher fled war-torn Europe with his wife to establish an independent life in America, and their descendants are carrying on that tradition. Farming in Virginia is tough enough for our family, but nothing compared to the Kilcher's daily struggle to survive. I'm cheering them on, especially through those interminable winters. I'm as far north as I care to be in the Shenandoah Valley."
B009L46WWQ ok i really like all surveying type shows and watching people living off the grid and this family is really doing that. This is excellent and i find it vastly entertaining."
B009L46WWQ Getting a glimpse of the Kilcher (sp?) family life and hardships is not only interesting but informative.  They must self-sustain for all aspects of their life for basic needs like food and water to heat.  The scenery is spectacular.  The hunting and fishing is not for sport but for sustenance.  I enjoy learning about different lifestyles and this show gives a very honest view of that."
B009L46WWQ living off the grid (supposedly)  you can see evidence of electrical service  but living in Alaska would be tough even with electricityshows some of the perils and hardships involved. A little too much informantion on the subject of POO"
B009L46WWQ I wasn't enthralled by the first episode but decided to watch the second anyways.  Wow, I was quickly roped in by the difficult life that this family has.  I've watched every episode and can't wait for more.  The episode where they take the barge up the river is just too much to comprehend.  This family accomplishes more in one summer than most do in a decade."
B009L46WWQ This show is a great way to see how the settlers lived with just a little technology to help them live a little better. Wish I was up there with them. So glad there are women that enjoy that way of life. Rock on."
B009L99U34 THE HOMICIDE HUNTER IS LIKE NO OTHER!!YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS A SECOND OFTHIS SHOW, HE IS SOOOOOO WITTY.  CANNOTWAIT FOR THE NEW SHOWS COME ON.  I HAVETHE PRIME INSTANT VIDEO AND CAN WATCHHIM ON AMAZON, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITHAMAZON, IT IS WORTH THE MONEY!!"
B009L99U34 This show is full of Kendaism. I love his practical way to confront crime. Of course I never tire of stupid perpetrators thinking that they have devised the perfect crime. I'm yet to see a person stand up and say&#34;yeah, I did it. &#34;But there is a long line of guests of the Colorado department of corrections who thought they were smarter than trained detectives."
B009L99U34 This is an excellent show, for those who like this kind of stuff.  There are so many true crime shows to watch now, a virtual explosion of them lately.  But somehow in that sea of crime shows this one stands out.  Joe Kenda is interesting.  He borders on being a bit smug and arrogant sometimes, but doesn't quite cross the line and you can't help but like him.  Every story is as wild as the last, couldn't stop watching them.  I hope there's another season of this show."
B009L99U34 This show is really well done. Very interesting and he's a great guy. I love his approach and narration. Recommend."
B009L99U34 A very succinct way of cutting to the chase.  Its apparent as to why this guy was so successful at solving homicides.  We all are spouting &#34;kendaisms&#34; around the house."
B009L99U34 This is a pretty good crime show.  Detective Kenda kind of reminds me of Horatio in CSI Miami with his &#34;cool&#34; one liners b
B009LG31R8 This is more a party-on kegger film for college age frat boys who want to hoot and holler over one of the &#34;remember when' moments before puberty or right after!  This is not recommended for kids, but it is funny to some of us who are demented and irreversibly adolescent in our tastes and persuasions."
B009LG31R8 Not quite sure what this movie was trying to be.  Really, really bizarre.Seemed a bit too focused on off-putting shock value over telling an actual story.  Most all of the kids were pretty atrocious actors, and by no means anyone's best work - be it Patton Oswalt, Knoxville, or Rob Riggle... Although Riggle was definitely the best of the bunch.  One scene in particular where he talks crap to the guy in the yellow shirt was pretty hilarious.I mean.. it's free and on demand, and I've seen plenty of worse movies from the service.  Don't go in expecting much and you'll be rewarding with 10 or so pleasant minutes out of its 104 total minutes."
B009LG31R8 This movie is really bad.  Not funny in the least.  A total waste of time. So sorry I rented it."
B009LG31R8 Extremely poorly written. I found the jokes more disturbing then sad as the movie progressed. This is a very adult film, not something any age kid should be watching. From the hardcore porn playing in the backround, to the full frontal nudity. Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like, wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball. Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids. Instead of adding in some funny inendo, or word plays, like the other films. They show hardcore porn, nudity, and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny, and WTF. They stayed firmly on the WTF side the entire film."
B009LG31R8 This film raises serious questions, such as should I give my copy away or throw it out? Randy (Patton Oswalt) is determined to take a group of boys on a scouting trip. He persuades the kids with a corny scout video to the dismay of everyone and absconds with the kids to the woods. The film had potential, but didn't know which way to go. The frequency of crude humor prevented it from being a kid's film. The crude juvenile humor prevented it from becoming a good adult film. It should have appeal to an adolescent crowd, one too young for the rating.The characters are poorly developed. Leonard, whose mother coddles him, is not utilized. Kent's attraction for the older women could have been made more for an adult audience, as long as the film is going that way. What was with the naked girl on the motorcycle? The opening scene was idiotic as scout masters take on the responsibility of informing a child his father has died.Are there funny scenes? Yes. In spite of all the crudeness, there were scenes which made me laugh, but too few to put up with a poorly written production. At one point I thought they were going to mimic \"Lord of the Flies,\" but that fell flat. I think a LOTF spoof would have worked better i.e. make Leonard a fat kid they call \"Piggy\" etc.Watch at you own risk.Parental Guide: Frequent F-bombs in front of children.

B009LZCN5K This film is dead on.  Anyone who goes to the doctor, whether they have health insurance or not, should be concerned about health care in the United States. It's purpose is not to improve the general health of American citizens, but to micromanage diseases with expensive drugs or procedures.Since viewing this movie, I've thought about my past experience with medical providers, and I have cause to wonder why I was prescribed medications, why I underwent procedures that I might not have needed, and why so many expensive tests are performed when they weren't necessary. Last week, I had to undergo tests in order to gain access to a specialist. You can't even have a conversation with a specialized doctor unless you pay for the test first!  That makes absolutely no sense.One of the subjects in this film has over a dozen stents, which, come to find out, she didn't even need, but now has to live with for the rest of her life. It made me think about my mom, who also had over a dozen stents, and was at her primary care office several times every week since one appointment could only last a maximum of 15 minutes. My mom went through two bouts of breast cancer. The second time, she developed an infection that almost killed her.I want to thank those who participated in making this movie."
B009LZCN5K Thought the movie would be boring, but it turned out just the opposite. This was one of the most informative movies I have ever watched. It's a must see."
B009LZCN5K It told a good tip when faced with a forest fire and no where to go. Then shows how US health care is driven with the same sad outlook. A few gory scenes, but worth it for all the light shed on how Insurance companies drive the medical field. All mighty dollar at work.Doug"
B009LZCN5K Yay, free on Amazon Prime!This was so poignant to watch.  I can relate to the doctor of La Clinica quitting her job because she wasn't able to do her job.  She went to school to help people, but was getting blocked by the government to really help people.  People stopped becoming people; they were objects/numbersEscape Fire is an interesting term.  I won't spoil it for you, but you'll be drawn into the documentary within minutes once you get what that really means.When I first watched the video, I was multi-tasking.  I had first missed the explanation of escape fire altogether, but watching it a second time I knew this was to be looked at with respect and was deserving of my undivided attention."
B009LZCN5K Very informative, really enjoyed watching this documentary about the healthcare situation and how it pays doctors to treat all patients with Rx instead of taking the healthy, holistic approach, and treating the true underlying causes of Americans' primary causes of chronic illnesses- extremely poor diet and exercise."
B009LZCN5K A powerful documentary that starts by describes the broken health system in the USA,and then talks about solutions that already exist and are implemented in various citiesin the USA.It is so tragic to realize that the most powerful country in the world does not have the means to take care of its people or rather it takes care of the people that are makingmoney out of the misery and pain of so many people.A country where pain is business, where the legal drug trade rivals anything thatillegal drug trafficking does (apart from the violence), and that it does notoffer a way out for the people.Still, as I said, there are sides to that story that are positive, individual efforts that show that there is a way out from personal health issues, only if people, companiesand the government just realize that they must cooperate with each otherfor the benefit of all, not just of bank accounts!"
B009LZCN5K watch this film for an insight that will change your way of life , I know it did mine ."
B009M73DN8 The ebb and flow of power, powers many a tv series. If not all. Throw in a little love and you have the plotlines for every story since Shakespeare.  Nashville is no exception. While the show burbles along at a merry pace, the hints as to where it may be going are never very far off. There is the country queen, whose grip on her audience is starting to slip, the brash upstart whose morals are of questionable value, the Power Figure, who seeks to Rule All in the shadows, but cannot, since Love and Family are never very far away. All in all, not a bad stew, but as for sudden surprises, unforeseeable characters, stunning twists... maybe they're yet to come, I haven't seen them yet."
B009M73DN8 After watching the first three episodes of Nashville, I can definitely say that Nashville is worth the hype it received in promotion. Excellent writing, acting, music and storylines. Nashville has it all.The characters are well developed with what first appear to be stereotypical stock characters flowering into aching, yearning human beings. Deacon in particular doesn't do what the viewer expects. The setting is original and well captured as well and a refreshing change of pace from the usual doctor, lawyer and police procedurals. The music runs the gamut in country styles from classic to pop and is a real addition to the show and I say this as a person who isn't necessarily a fan of country music...but I love this. A home run for ABC."
B009M73DN8 I really enjoyed watching the first Season of Nashville again, on DVD. I am from Nashville, and love seeing the scenes of my hometown, and the fact that the series is actually shot here. I also really like the music. The only problem I had with my CD's is that I was in a rehab center for surgery when it arrived, and It was one day after 1 month when I finished watched. One of the discs, and one of the best scenes (the one with Rayna and Deacon in bed singing together) was damaged. It kept skipping and I could not even watch a good deal of that scene. I would have exchanged it, but waited one day too late from the 30 day rating. I still give the season 5 starts, because the damaged portion was not the fault of the series!"
B009M73DN8 I had expected more for the main character. So good in Friday Night Lights! This is weakly written and lacks polish."
B009M73DN8 I am such a fan of Connie Britton (mainly because of her portrait of Vivian in American Horror Story) and I absolutely love Hayden Penettiere. This show brought together two powerhouse actress for one amazingly dynamic show. The show is about an older country singer who refuses to be pushed around by her record label, and a young country starlet who is the chart topper of the record label."
B009M73DN8 Fantastic show. Great cast - wonderful to watch. Wonderfully compelling stories that keep you eager for the next episode. And the music...oh the music. We would watch this just for the music, but fortunately, this show is exceptional in every way. What a great (and long overdue) concept. Bring on season 2!"
B009M73DN8 I really appreciate the amount of effort that goes into this show. Performing on stage in a large venue is mind boggling. That took a lot of preparation and rehearsals to  come together and look so effortlessly. I especially enjoy Episode 7 where they sang that duet, they were both great. I often go back to that just to listen to that song again."
B009M73DN8 Great new show, beautiful music this show has it all. Really hoping it gets picked up for a second season."
B009M73DN8 Nashville is one of my favorite shows, a country soap opera is right up my alley. I love the actors, I love the music and for a change it's one of the few shows with a good story line."
B009M73DN8 This show is fun, heartwarming,  has beautiful people and music. Connie Brittion is a great actress, we loved her on Saturday Night Lights, and were thrilled to find her starring in this new show."
B009M73DN8 love this show had missed a few episodes of the first season so we bought season one and glad we did."
B009M73DN8 Note: I've seen every episode of this show in HD via XFinity On Demand.Nashville is the second television series to focus on music (and after tonight, it wll be the only one, as SMASH is sadly airing its series finale tonight after II seasons), and in terms of romantic content, it's better than SMASH. I'm not really a fan of country music, but this series has really turned me into a fan.Hayden Pannitiere has grown up since her memorable turn as Will Patton's daughter in the disney sports drama Remember The Titans, and here she certainly has plenty of solid dramatic material to sink her teeth into Connie Britton is equally solid, as is the rest of the main and supporting cast. Every episode is worth viewing.Rated TV-PG (mild violence, mild language & mild sensuuality)."
B009M73DN8 I haven't enjoyed a TV show this much for a long time.Yes, there are elements of soap opera but the directors do an excellent job creating genuine characters. As my wife said other than Rayna James (Connie Britton's character) most of the other characters you at some time in the series love them and at other times don't like them much. Good character arcs with some great country music make this compelling television. I was captivated by each episode that I often went to bed thinking about it which I very rarely do.The relationships between characters is well done especially Rayna and Deacon. The tension between these two ebbs and flows in the background throughout every episode and explodes at the end.The final episode has so much action in it to fill about 5 separate episodes and I'm so disappointed that I now need to wait a year to see Season 2.Great job and I can't recommend this series enough."
B009M73DN8 Please don't ever cancel this series because it is the best of it's kind and I am as hooked as one could get!!! Amazing show!!"
B009M73DN8 I would not watch this show with younger children as it deals with adult issues. So far it hasn't been too graphic in the sex scenes and I hope it stays that way. While I am a more conservative viewer of programs, I like this show because it not only shows what I consider their bad choices, but the results of those choices. And you get the background of the characters that lead them to make poor choices. I like the way the character Juliette is portrayed in that we get to see her grow up and learn from her mistakes...hopefully to a wise young woman, not bitter and vindictive. I do see a problem in this area where the characters continue to make the same mistakes over and over again to the point of the plots just becoming predictable and irritating."
B009M73DN8 A must have. Every episode gets better and better. I will watch over and over. That's how much I love this series. You will too."
B009M73DN8 This is show has great acting, great music and many plots!  We love it!  As the seasons go on the music and plots get better.  This is Family fare at its best!"
B009M73DN8 This is an absorbing series set in Nashville which provides a nice change from East/West coast dramas. Whoever cast the show deserves a bonus. The actors are really good from the stars to the smaller parts.  And, in a tribute to Nashville, the music is also terrific. It actually adds rather than distracts from the various plot lines, a balance which can be difficult to master. There are several intersecting story lines which concern people struggling for success in the music business, in politics,, and the effect of celebrity on the personal lives of people in those arenas.  The plots are not predictable with interesting twists in almost every episode.Hayden Panettiere was a particular surprise to me as she has some real acting chops in a role which might have been reduced to eye candy with a lesser performer.I have watched all the episodes online but the series is so good that I am purchasing the DVD."
B009M73DN8 Love this show. When I am unable to watch it is set for DVR. I like all the songs that they sing on the show and I play the CD's in my car all the time. Would recommend to anybody."
B009M73DN8 I chose this rating because the pilot was awesome! I'm just barely on episode 5 but it's keeping my attention."
B009M73DN8 This is basically a soap opera set in the Nashville country and political music scene.  The main story involves Connie Britton (best known for her role in Spin City) stars as an aging country music star who is trying to keep her career going, and Hayden Panettiere (best known from Heroes) is the young diva...kind of the country version of Britney Spears when she hit the pop scene years ago, who is immensely popular but thought of as a joke by the &#34;real&#34; musicians.  They are both trying to reinvent themselves to appeal to a wider audience.There are also several ancillary stories involving affairs, love triangles, illegitimate children, screwed up family members, drugs etc.  Basically everything you would expect from a show of this type.  It is not so complex that it is hard to keep it all straight, and the show does a very good job of developing and occasionally interweaving the various story lines.  Some of it does certainly get a little silly, but none is so over the top that it is totally stupid.The good thing about the show is that you do not really need to be a country fan to enjoy it.  You may or may not like the music a little more if you are a fan of contemporary country, but I think the music they include have a wide enough appeal that even if you are not a huge fan you can sit through it without wanting to turn it off.  Which is essential given how much of a key role the music plays in the show.  Pretty much every show has a pretty long musical number (usually to end the episode) and lots of smaller numbers throughout the show.  Another good thing about the show is that the actors actually sing the songs, and do a good job doing so.The acting and the writing of the stories are very good.  I liked the stories involving the mayoral race, election and fallout (mainly because Powers Boothe plays such a great bad guy) and Juliette's mother's substance abuse more (at times) than the main music rivalry stories.  One comes to a conclusion (mostly) by the end of the season, and one is left pretty much open ended.  There are couple cliffhangers going into the second season that will work prominently into the story.For those who get the DVDs, there is a lot of bonus material included.  A few short making of and behind the scenes features, some deleted scenes and a couple song specific features on how a couple of the more prominent songs were worked into the show.  All in all, enough to make those who like going through that material happy.Whether you like a show like this or not will be pretty subjective.  It is much in the genre of shows that are part drama, part soap opera.  So if you do not tend to like those kinds of shows anyway then you will not like this.  If you do tend to like those kinds of shows, then this is definitely worth giving a chance."
B009M73DN8 Not being a country music fan, I let the episodes pile up without being watched but during the holidays watched several and really enjoyed the music."
B009M73DN8 I thinkn this show is excellent on multiple levels.  As the storyline driven show - it is very well done with the two main chactarers having very different lives and how each deals with them.  On the musicians side _since I'm a musician_ I like seeing just how ruthless and so chiseled in stone the whole Nashville music scene is.  If you want to do something NOT in the Nashville labels &#34;Okay List&#34;, then you dont get support, or perhaps not even signed or recorded at all."
B009M73DN8 Number one I have fallen in love with this show, but also I could not feel more that the quality of this product is absolutely extraordinary and I have enjoyed watching all of the episodes."
B009M73DN8 Every episode of Nashville is better than the last! It's worth watching the whole season. Season 1 was a great start....looking forward to season 2!"
B009M73DN8 Best musical drama show I've watched in a long time. y the CD and listen to the music. The story is Great also. Hope Deacon get's a break soon he deserves one. ABC is know for cancelling good shows!!! So buy the DVD now before they decide to cancel the show and put the DVD out of print. It's happened before trust me. They prefer Revenge over Nashville. I men come on if you can't kill your enemies in four years that's pretty sad. Nashville has a hell of a lot more potential for a great long series than Revenge which they renewed and cancelled Nashville for season 3. so enjoy the music and story it' great."
B009M73DN8 Nashville, as the name implies, is a Nashville based fictional drama television series about up and coming, and, already famous country music singers. It airs on ABC.Season 1 introduces some of our favorite characters and the first bits of trouble and drama. Connie Britton is amazing as country sensation Rayna James. One of my top two for this series. Rayna is an established artist, mother of 2 and daughter of the Mayor all while remaining very grounded and stoic. She struggles with folks at the label, whom she feels is stifling her career.Then there is energetic and always stirring up something Juliette Barns played by Hayden Panettiere. Juliette is a young, country pop star, so to speak, and she is ready to have legend status. In her ambition she is always leaping without looking first. Then forever trying to live down an event she really isn't bothered by to begin with.Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) is Rayna's long time front guitar man and former flame, though she is married to Teddy Conrad (Eric Close.) There is always some tension between the two as they vie for her time and attention. Rayna will have to make some changes to hold peace in her life.A few of our newcomers in the world of country music include Scarlett (Clare Bowen), Avery (Jonathan Jackson) and Gunner (Sam Palladio.) And yes, there is definitely some heat and friction with these young people out there trying to make it. The drama is there, but these kids always go back to the music. I think it is part of what makes them endearing.I really enjoy the acting on Nashville. Especially that of Britton and Esten. I feel they make their roles so believable and interesting. The show really encompasses all aspects of the musical scene in Nashville, involving artists from made status all the way to entry.The first season is my favorite so far."
B009M73DN8 Well done show, I love the drama and all the music in the show. It is a classic young verses old school with music and what it takes to rise to the top."
B009M73DN8 First off, I am not a fan of country music so when I first heard about this show, I quickly dismissed it.  However, when I saw a trailer I realized I needed to check it out. Rayna is a strong, independent, and very likable female lead and Connie Britton plays her so well.  Hayden Panatierre's character on the surface seems like a real b****, but you find out early on that she's actually a very damaged girl with a bad family life.  The production value is great and it's cool to get a glimpse at what goes on behind the scenes at the record company, backstage at concerts, and in the bars of Nashville.  The show is more than just country music. There is also a politics side story, which is just as compelling as the music plot.  I'll definitely keep watching this one.  Also, the music is good."
B009M73DN8 Very happy with this show!  Great story line - I'm def hooked!  Connie Britton does an excellent job!  Will be anxious for season 2!"
B009M73DN8 Nice, but not very thrilling.  Sort of predictable, but okay.......not terrible....not great.  I like Connie Britton [Friday Night Lights], and she is solid in this as well."
B009M73DN8 I'm not a country fan, but I love the music...more than I love the story lines around the singers.  Typical drama surrounding politics and the music industry.  The music is pretty good. That's what keeps me watching this show."
B009M73DN8 My daughter, 14 years old, wanted to watch this show.  I said I'd watch it with her.  Much to my surprise, I absolutely loved it!  So does she.  It is a real favorite in our house."
B009M73DN8 I really like country music and I enjoy relationships and I do not know anything about the music business.  The music in this show is a teaser---you get a few seconds of really good stuff and then it's off to something else.  I am sure they are doing that so people will buy the music but I do not like being manipulated like that.The relationships are smutty and flat and predictable.  Sort of like the old fashioned bad &#34;cryin' in my beer my gal done me wrong and my dog hates me too and I  smell just fine and if you don't like it you can kiss my  ....&#34;  songs.There is not one person who is a moral, upright, stalwart, good and Godly person to offset the smuttiness and dirtiness of the rest of the cast.  I want to have at least some hope that good will triumph---there is none of that here.So, this is not entertaining to me.  It is frustrating."
B009M73DN8 Review of DVD set - It's all about the MUSICI feel like I should be paying Tennessee income tax after spending a week in \"Music City\" for the Americana Music Festival and Conference two weeks ago and then \"binge-watching\" this DVD set with more than 15 hours (plus bonus material) of content. But, looking back, it was worth it. The city has so much talent - especially song crafters (a higher level of songwriters).I missed watching the show on TV and I prefer to keep \"storylines\" in some logical order and so I went in to my nightly viewing session (3 episodes a night), not knowing much.  Since the commercials have been excised, each 60-minute episode runs under 45 minutes on the DVD. And each contains at least two full musical performances. Between all  the music are a bunch of storylines about those at the top of the commercial \"country music\" business and those who's are trying to get a break.  And then there is the \"political\" storyline, not unlike that in my favorite musical series on TV, \"Treme\". At times \"Nashville\" reminds me of shows like \"Dynasty\" or \"Dallas\" with rich power brokers and cat fights between their wives and lovers. And, yes, there are plenty of sexual affairs spread throughout the show. After all this is a soap opera, plain and simple. But with a big difference. Series creator, Callie Khouri, is married to record producer T-bone Burnett and he is in charge of the music - of which there is plenty.I'll let you read my fellow reviewers comments on the non-musical portions of the show and the actors, and just say that some of the story lines grabbed me while others were just there until the characters started playing and singing. One of the unique things in the show is that the cast can actually sing and , some can play. Note that, unlike \"Treme\", where the musical numbers were performed and recorded \"live\" (in real time), in \"Nashville\" the music was prerecorded and the actors lip-sync the lyrics. But they do a darn good job of it. The songs were written by some of Nashville's finest but - for some reason that I don't understand - the writers are not provided in the show's closing credits.  (It just says \"Music by T-Bone Burnett). Don't these writers deserve credit? Also, though a few well know country artists show up in scenes (and in the opening credits) - Vince Gill, Pam Tillis and JD Souther (who all have speaking, not performance rolls), the musicians in the band are not credited either (Canadian guitarist Colin Linden is just one I noticed.).  This probably doesn't mean much to the casual TV watcher but it might introduce them to some great talent.The first season is being released on DVD and not Bluray, which is a shame. I noticed that many of the inside scenes in rooms with wood walls had a sepia tone look on the actors skin. (This on my newly tuned flat screen HD TV). If ever a set needed BD treatment, this is it. Also on my \"I wish the producers would have....\" list would be creating \"chapter stops\" for just the musical performances (other DVDs call this a \"Jukebox\" option) so you could return to those on repeat viewing.There are about 30 minutes of \"bonus features\" on the set, most of them short. The \"behind the scenes\" featurette is short at six minutes. There are two-minutes of \"bloopers\" and another section with  some deleted scenes that don't add much. Music fans will find the most interesting to be the two interviews with the (uncredited) songwriters for two of the major songs in the show.  (Note that there is a four-CD set of the show's musical numbers, though I have yet to hear it.)So, this DVD is not perfect - but the musical performances make this a high recommendation from me.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
B009M73DN8 I agree with the following: The main characters don't seem to be able to pick themselves up before they are tripping over themselves again. I live in Nashville. I know lots of healthy people in the industry. Also, it doesn't show much of the rest of Nashville - where the ordinary people live out their lives. Churches here are not backdrops for marrying music stars. Faith is important to many people, including musicians. I'd like to see the main characters wrestle with some issues like growing up in the Bible belt and figuring out what you believe (in a way that doesn't put down people's faith). THIS IS A QUOTE FROM ANOTHER REVIEW. I also found the portrayal of AA dogma to be false at so many times, and accurate in so many other ways, I would urge all people with substance abuses to watch, listen and learn."
B009M73DN8 I like this show due to the idea that it does not deal with crime, prosecuters, lawyers, fire, police. No disrespect to the latter. This is a nice change to what I see on TV all the time. However again, popular viewing deals with crime, lawyer, fire and police. I am just glad that there is an alternate out there to view.As with all TV shows there is drama, but I just hope this drama doesn't make me crazy with sitting on the edge of my seat stuff. Why do I say that? demographics... I am no spring chicken. So with that, I wish this program well but keep in mind.. you start pulling ridicoluos situations.. I will be done."
B009M73DN8 Love this show! The cast is great and the storylines are juicy. Also, love the music and how great everyones voices are."
B009M73DN8 Yes, it's got a soap opera format. But the musical songs are so nice  for listening. I like the voices of the singers. Ther ensemble group work well together. I like that each character is giving focus as the series progresses. I gave it 4 stars because the writing could be create more complex story lines. But, I love the music."
B009M9GI06 i never seen this before ordering it and i watched it when i recieved it and it wasnt all that,i wouldnt recommend it at all.its not good"
B009M9GI06 This film made my #1 favorite horror film of the year for my October special, and is a good candidate to make my top films of the year list as well. The dark psycho family thriller had me sitting on the edge of my seat often as it's full of uneasy and sometimes shocking moments. The acting is all around impressive and the atmosphere is well set in a wooded remote location. This is a thriller nearly perfectly executed.Source: criticnic.com 17 November 2012Disclosure: film sent by IFC Films"
B009M9GI06 When I read the description, I thought that it was exactly what the Japanese did to Chinese extended family compounds BEFORE the official invasion and declaration of war against China.  But when they forced the two homeowners to perform sex for their edification.  I knew that this was DEFINITELY about and not coincidentally echoing the home invasion rapes and murders by the Japanese in China BEFORE the war when they were seeding the country with their operatives.My great grandfather gave my mother their family ancestry archives.  The earlier \"pages\" predate paper.  Now if you belonged to a peaceful, fortunate extended family, you absolutely would choose to live together in a family compound away from neighbors and that meant you would be interesting to the operatives who were found by the Chinese government to have sent entire TRAINED families to China to relocate and spy in the generations before formal declaration of war.They were always successful so they literally slipped into the shoes of the rightful/murdered owners, lived their lives, used their names and DEFINITELY took possession of those archives.  It's not the same thing as Saul Tighe not realizing he is a Cylon (oops, Spoilers!) because it's not about habits that you adopt for yourself as the culture of Japan continues to do, it's not about reading the I-Ching or any of our other works with graduate-level training and expertise.  It is about not being able to create the I-Ching from scratch, it's about not having the heart to start with that infuses what your bloodline makes with soul.  No soul, no heart, no original, authentic bloodline and they invaded our homes like this movie.\"Coal trucks were sent out to collect women. Age didn't matter; girls as young as 11 and women as old as 80. Virgins were prized to affirm a warrior's virility. Twenty soldiers might rape a woman. Or, out of sadism, they might order a father on a daughter.\"Why would Hollywood make this movie if it is not about China and it would explain the purges of families singled out in China in the postwar years.The Remains of the Dayis also about foreign facility with imitation not just accent.  The writing itself not just the story is what is telltale."
B009M9GI06 Paid $9.99 to rent this primarily based on the two really glowing reviews left on here by people who called this the best movie they'd seen in a while etc.  Beware:  I think those reviewers might be marketing people working for the studio that put this out.I really like psychological thrillers, mysteries, horror, etc.  I like Selma Blair as well.  I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be, but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund.  It was terrible.  There's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes.  It's very obvious what's going on.The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting, as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen...and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation.  I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I don't like and who I wish would leave...but they can't take the hint.By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $9.99 on it and I just can't turn it off and not see the rest of it.This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and can't get to sleep.  I would never recommend this to anyone...definitely don't waste money on it and don't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5-stars and saying it is the best thing ever.I fell for that scam this time.  I saw two glowing reviews and one bad one and I thought the person who wrote the bad review was wrong...but now I have to side with that person because this movie stunk."
B009M9GI06 A good friend told my to buy this film... I was completely impressed and have since purchased this movie for friends.  The film is slow, but steadily exciting.  I normally do not watch films with Selma Blair (personal choice), but she adds a wonderful rawness to te stark and eerie movie!  This is an excellent movie that reminds me of older horor/thriller movies from the black and white days!"
B009M9GI06 A toothless, unoriginal thriller, IN THEIR SKIN follows a fairly wealthy family (lawyer father, alcoholic mother, prop-set son) as they retreat to their vacation home in the woods following the accidental death of their daughter. While they grieve and struggle to hold both themselves and their family together, they encounter another family (dad, mom, and son) who a persistent about making nice. Of course, if you've seen the trailer (which gives away pretty much the entire film except for the final fifteen minutes), this new family is not what they seem.The director does a decent job with what is obviously a paint-by-numbers script. Not a single line of dialogue or twist in the plot is unique or interesting, and the entire story feels like the product of a Learn Screen-Writing By Mail correspondence course. The acting isn't too bad, although the performers aren't asked to attempt anything of a whole lot of depth. And even though you can easily see where the film is headed, there are a few tense moments nevertheless. Unfortunately, they come after a whole lot of waffling around, and they precede an ending that feels sloppy, rushed, and pretty much tacked on. All in all, I wouldn't say it's a bad movie -- it feels almost like the template for a movie, like it wants to be embellished with more interesting characters, conversations, and plot elements -- but it's also about as memorable as a glass of water."
B009M9GI06 IN THEIR SKIN stars Selma Blair and Josh Close as a young couple who move with their gentle son into Dad's family home.  Of course, there's a tragic family secret haunting them.  Soon they meet their over effusive neighbors played by James D'arcy and Rachel Miner and their bullying son who gradually insinuate themselves into their lives.The film moves languidly and there are no real surprises or genuine thrills.  Blair sleepwalks through her role and D'arcy adopts a Hannibal Lechter impersonation that just doesn't work.More intensity in the pacing and performances might have had better results.  Sadly, IN THEIR SKIN just doesn't succeed."
B009M9GI06 This is another home invasion film. Mark (Joshua Close), Mary (Selma Blair), and their son Brendon (Quinn Lord) get away to their summer home when their daughter is killed in a car accident. While at their retreat they meet Bobby (James D'Arcy), Jane (Rachel Miner), and their son Jared (Alex Ferris). They get together for dinner where Bobby asks all kinds of questions and exhibits a high creep factor. This aspect was done very well as you can sense the creepiness in scene and characters.There is of course the later hostage situation and from the title and write up you know that these people want to take over the lives of the occupants. They did a lot to try to set this up, but I just didn't feel it like the creepiness. The problem with this film is that it lacked character. The characters were creepy, but were not colorful. Because the family was so bland, with Selma Blair looking gaunt, like a heroin addict, I didn't really care if they lived or died. In fact I was hoping they got knocked off early because they were boring. View at your own risk.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Selma Blair)."
B009M9GI06 I have seen a ton of movies, many of them thrillers and horror films, and this one made me so nervous that I had to keep getting up and taking  breaks.  James D'Arcy is nothing short of terrifying in his role as a man determined to replace a small family with his own.Josh Close attempts to keep the other family together while dealing with this home invasion thriller."
B009MQVO0S I can't say that I am any good at writing reviews or anything of that matter but I really liked this movie.  Call me a nerd or a loser..whatever the name of the day is...I could actually relate to this young man and how he felt out of place...not now perhaps but there was a time.  A great story and a moral if you are really paying attention."
B009MQVO0S This movie isn't bad. It's just that the trope of a well-off white kid going through a coming-of-age process has been done so many times and so much better.The main thing going for this movie is the comedy. At several points throughout the movie, the actors give such great comic performances, that it will almost make you want to sit through the boring angsty parts in between. I say almost because I ended up checking Facebook during a lot of those boring angsty parts.As I said, it isn't a bad movie. But if you want more consistently entertaining fare, check out &#34;Igby Goes Down&#34;, &#34;The Rules of Attraction&#34;, and &#34;Rushmore&#34;."
B009MQVO0S Peter Cameron's story SOMEDAY THIS PAIN WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU is coming of age tale that is, at turns, funny, sad, tender, and sophisticated. As adapted for the screen by director Roberto Faenza with Cameron and Dahlia Heyman this becomes an experimental film that will delight many and confuse some. The cast is excellent and once the audience moves into the rhythm of the narrated story it is difficult not to re-live youth and pull for the lad whose story this is.James Sveck (Toby Regbo) is a lonely young teenager who is tortured by his grossly unstable home environment and is fraught with hating people, suicidal thoughts, depression, and the preference for solitude.  It is the summer before he goes off to college at Brown University and he is conflicted: his vain lothario father (Peter Gallagher) insists that he go to college, his gallery owner mother (Marcia Gay Harden) has just returned form Las Vegas and her third failed marriage - this time to a compulsive gambler (Stephen Lang); his sister Gillian (Deborah Ann Woll) is writing her memoir and falling for an older married Polish professor; and James is working with his mother's gallery director (Gilbert Owuor), trying to make since of art, people, relationships and the chaos of the world that confuses him - the last thing he wants is to enter the college world. His mother lines him up with a Life Coach (Lucy Liu) and slowly James begins to come to grips with a past bad memory and to learn to accept who he is as someone worth living. James only loving connection to the world is his grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) and from her he learns a lot about the vagaries of life and how to cope. The story is told in the first person narration which helps give an intimate inside view of James as he works through his life at the therapy sessions which his parents insist he attend and it is in this manner that we learn about James's past and present through the stories he tells and his recounting of previous therapy sessions and the ambivalences and uncertainties of adolescence.The film manages to balance teenage angst and relationship failures with an equal amount of drama and comedy.  This is one of those films that linger in memory long after the final credits. Grady Harp, October 12"
B009MQVO0S A movie about a young man entering adulthood and confused about life...wait...haven't I seen that in about 100 other movies?  Yes, but that doesn't make this one BAD.  It's on a well-trod path but still remains true to itself (or maybe to the novel?)  James, our young man who ought to be heading to college but doesn't think he wants to, is played by Toby Regbo, who gives a fine performance with a mixture of deadpan humor and constant unhappiness.  It doesn't help that his ENTIRE FAMILY is screwed up--with the apparent exception of his grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) who mixes quiet acceptance with occasional good advice.  His other guide becomes the &#34;psychiatrist/life coach&#34; played by Lucy Liu.  Are there psychiatrist/life coaches?  They must be expensive--but anyhow, unlike the suggestion of the editorial review that there may have been some intimate relationship there, the movie shows no such thing.  Like any normal (or even suicidal) kid, James very much doesn't want anything to do with a &#34;therapist&#34;, but by being gently accepting (somewhat like his grandmother) she gradually draws him out of his reluctance to talk about his confusion and self-doubts, and also gets him off his ass.  I was surprised to see Peter Gallagher in the role of James's father.  I hadn't noticed him since &#34;Sex Lies and Videotape&#34;, and like the character in that film, he appears, at least at first glance like a cad.  Nevertheless, both he and mom love their kid and, despite their own messy lives, they want to help even if they don't know how.  Plus: Peter how is it you look just the same as you did 25 years ago?  Plastic surgery can't do that...were you CRYOFROZEN for two decades?  Seriously I'm jealous.This movie has plenty of humor, but not the slapstick sort that audiences seem to expect in a &#34;comedy&#34;.  If you enjoy something a little closer to real life than, say, The Hangover or Superbad, you may appreciate this film."
B009MQVO0S It's kind of a weighty and deep-seated film about a young man or boy(?) trying to find his way in life.  Not for the carefree and light-hearted."
B009MQVO0S James, played brilliantly by Toby Regbo is a confused young man looking for answers to his life. He lives in a dysfunctional family, but, then, who doesn't? His mother, payed byMarcia Gay Harden is in her third marriage, she manages an art gallery that doesn't sell much. Dad is Peter Hallagher looking for his youth,,sister is going out with a married, much older professor. The only sensible person in James' life is his grandmother played by Elen Burstyn. She is secure, mature and loves her grandson.James is working for his mother at the art gallery the summer before entering Brown. He is not certain he wants to go to college, which upsets his family. His parents have enlisted the assistance of a psychotherapist/ career counselor, Lucy Liu, to help James. They run while thy talk and Lucy tells James she thinks he is a smart young man. It is OK to be confused and he will fnd hs way. Grandma, Nanette, tells him the same. James meets her every weekend at her house. James's mom and Nanette have not spoken for awhile. It seems to me that the entire family could use Lucy Liu. James is a likable young man and the actor who plays him is superb, a terrific actor.'Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You' turns the agonizing life choices of a 17-year-old boy into the stuff of high drama. This is a quiet little film, that turns it's charm on all of us.Recommended. prisrob 06-10-13"
B009MQVO0S The movie had a great cast and many independent movies do but this was kind of hard to follow.  You just kept wait for the plot to take you somewhere and it really never came.  I gave three stars because of the cast but the plot I would give one."
B009MUWEJE Very good movie.  Very moving.  I think everyone should see it.  It is a shame that this real life drama took place but it does teach on what is still going on in this world. A movie that teaches what a person sows they will end up reaping in their future at some point in time or eternity, whichever comes first."
B009MUWEJE I must have been over seas when it happened.  Incredible that a person without ID could wander in and out of a labor ward or hospital ward and steel a baby.  How tragic, and heart breaking for the family who lost the daughter.  How confusing for the girl when she grew up and found out she was abducted.  Just so heart breaking.  So incredible."
B009MUWEJE I can, and have been, critical of Lifetime made-for-TV movies for ripping &#34;based on actual events&#34; cases from the headlines and turning them into rather lurid fodder for fictionalized dramatic recreations. It is one of their go-to genres. Sometimes you don't need all the sensationalistic melodrama when the tale itself is both compelling and fascinating. And in the simplicity of its presentation, &#34;Abducted: The Carlina White Story&#34; is one of the network's more heartfelt entries into this overstuffed format. Level-headed and real, this accounting benefits from an understated tone and (at least) one truly dynamic performance. While the screenplay sometimes takes some major shortcuts which sacrifice significant parts of the actual story, it is still one of the better efforts from Lifetime that I've seen in quite some time. And, in all candor, it is a film that I had almost no interest in seeing! Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to myself. What do I know anyway?&#34;Abducted&#34; tells the story of a girl who was stolen from the hospital shortly after her birth. As the parents pursue any lead, the case makes headlines that only intensify when they also seek to hold the hospital legally responsible. As they come to terms with the difficulties of losing their daughter, the abductor proceeds to raise the child for the next two decades! The case once again made headlines when Carlina White, as an adult, began to unravel the secret and seek out her real family. She is placed in an untenable position. Should she embrace the family she has never known? And if so, does that mean she has to cut ties with her entire existence. It's a knotty dilemma, handled reasonably well in the hands of director Vondie Curtis-Hall. I wish the story would have spent more time on the arising suspicions and the process of what happens, but much of that is left to the imagination. Her investigation into her identity consists of a couple of Internet searches, that's how little effort is spent on this portion of the tale.But despite its shortcomings, &#34;Abducted&#34; should be lauded for its incredible lead performance by Aunjanue Ellis. Ellis plays the unstable woman responsible for the kidnapping, and it's a role of great passion and vigor. Ellis always seems to be the most unpredictable actress in whatever role she is undertaking, and here that really pays off. You can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen, and I missed her when she was not. Other major players include Sherri Shepherd, a nice change of pace as the other mother, and Keke Palmer as a grown Carlina. Overall, this is such a fascinating story, you'll definitely want to see how it plays out. It sometimes falls into the trap of the typical TV movie by-the-numbers narrative, but Ellis is always quick to give the film a jolt of energy just when it needs it the most! KGHarris, 2/13."
B009MUWEJE True story about how a child is abducted at birth and raised in another atmosphere than her natural parents would have. The woman who kidnapped the child is verging on being insane then snaps back to near normal off and on during the film.  It shows how, though she and her circumstances are pitiful, she has torn apart this other family and has no remorse.  The kidnapped child, now a young woman with a child of her own, is very torn between the two worlds, as she finds out who her real family is."
B009MUWEJE based on a true story this was a good movie.  It was a bit drawn out for my taste but still okay"
B009MUWEJE We enjoyed watching this movie.  It was different and interesting.  We are happy that the kidnapper got her just rewards."
B009MUWEJE The actors all did a wonderful job.  It was good to see they didn't simply show Ann Pettway as the villain, too - her action was wrong on many levels, and according to the movie, she still didn't seem to grasp the pain she caused to many, many people.  However, she didn't steal baby Carlina for malicious reasons, or to extract money from her parents, or to torture and/or abuse her.  She stole the baby because she couldn't deal with the loss of another baby through miscarriage, and in her grief and depression - walked out of the hospital with another woman's child to raise and love, and be able to receive a child's love.  As much as her action horrified an angered me, I couldn't help myself, I felt pity for her, as well.I cannot imagine the pain and anguish Joy and Carl went through, during the twenty-three years they were denied their child.  The stolen baby resulted in their inability to remain together as a couple, everyone's life was completely altered by the theft of this child.  I found the replay of Nettie's interview, where she stated she wasn't Nejdra, as that name had been forced on her, and she wasn't Carlina, as that name had been stolen from her - that being Nettie felt right, to be very poignant.My only complaint about the movie would be the final few minutes when they had the &#34;blurbs&#34; posted, giving updates on what has happened since filming... they flashed by so quickly, I didn't get to read them all!  I simply did a quickie Google search then, and read several articles.  I highly recommend this movie."
B009MUWEJE The Lifetime original movie Abducted: The Carlina White Story is based on a remarkable true story that made headlines twice. Carlina White knows something is very wrong when she can't develop a deep bond with her mother."
B009N452XY One of the many, many, far too many spin-offs of the Blair Witch Boondoggle!  This one starts out better and with more good moments of human interest.  But, and this is where the film school crap takes over: just turns into a bloody gorefest with no plot, meaning, conclusion or plot to make it into a cogent whole with a real plausible story-line.  Next, I suppose will be the take-off on teh Todd Sees case which has so many nuances, that it would make a great movie if handled right!"
B009N452XY Technically poor, disjointed story in which nothing much happens and what does is not worth bothering with. I didn't finish it. Nuff said."
B009N452XY Laying the foundation for the story line took way to long, and I way to much screaming,  a few scary minutes near the end..."
B009N452XY Terrible acting, and quality is very low on the camera work. If you have prime it;s free so you can see for yourself."
B009N452XY This movie was soooooo awful and the pitiful attempt to be blair witch was sickening. Maybe come up with something original."
B009NB5UXE I love a good ghost story, especially those that are based on real people and their stories.  This is a pretty good series if you like the spooky VoiceOver coupled with the regular person giving snippets of their version while better looking actors play them in a reenactment format.My only problem is that while this rolls along and can get very scary at times, some of the reenactment kind of makes me laugh...for instance demons in the mirror will simply be someone in really cheezy halloween makeup with a bushy wig...if you're going to all of the trouble to make it all seem real, why not go the extra step and make the demons and grim reaper characters not look so hokey?Aside from that these episodes can be pretty entertaining if not wholly believable."
B009NB5UXE I love this show! It will spook you out, has great stories & will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
B009NB5UXE I enjoy watching this type of material.  A Haunting primarily leans towards bad or demon type entities.  Maybe to make it more ominous or scary for the viewer.  Definitely would be fun to watch around Halloween."
B009NB5UXE Love this show, so well told and acted. I am a fan of this show and have been for 4 years."
B009NB5UXE I usually like the paranormal shows but this one was just bad.  The Wraith how bad can an interview be?  The whole story and the acting was very much lacking in everything.  Definitely not worth spending time watching and I want my 1.99 back.  This is the first time I really disliked something bad enough to write a negative review.  Don't waste time...there are much better shows out there."
B009NPK1IO This is my wife and also sisters favorite show. If you need a good girl show to watch, from what I am told this is it."
B009NPK1IO I'm still sad Gossip Girl ended. Six seasons that seemed to be like three, and this sixth and final season doesn't dissapoint. New faces, new mysteries and of course the most important secret is revealed! (GG's identity).I just wish it could have lasted longer, at least thirteen episodes; ten episodes are not enough for a final season of any show, and I feel like the writers rushed everything up by the final three or two episodes.Anyway, this season has the most shocking moments and twists (Dan's revenge from the UES society, Serena's sudden change of attitude, and Blair and Chuck finally trying to have their happy ending, and Nate... well, dating Sage).If you're a fan of the show, you have to buy this to complete your collection. Gossip Girl may have ended, but hey, at least we have the DVD's!"
B009NPK1IO I'm a big fan of GG, and have followed the series since the beginning. After a somewhat disappointing seasons 4 and 5, I was 'over' the show. However, season 6 was much better and tied up a lot of loose ends - and wow, what a finale! Bittersweet to see the show end, but I enjoyed the ride!"
B009NPK1IO It was sad seeing this series end. I was such a fan of the first 2 seasons but I'm glad the ending was satisfying. For anyone who's watched GG and is familiar with the show knows how melodramatic it can be. The last 5 seasons were filled with some mind blowing scenarios that were a bit exaggerated that sometimes especially in season 5 just took the flavor and sophistication out of the show. I'm glad this season came around and did it the right way this time. The writers have finally redeemed themselves of the horrid things they were threwing at us last season. Not saying that this season is the best so far but it comes close, very close the only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is for these following minor problems that I had with the show.[MAJOR SPOILER/ DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE WATCHED THE SHOW]-Problem #1: The end of Bart Bass. These people spent almost the entire season the first 9 episodes to take Bart down who is very clearly the biggest, most feared and ultimate villain of the show. Of course, their plans to bring him down didn't go well at all. They had to face many obstacles and disappoints and many of them suffered from it. But then when the final curtains came closing down and he actually was defeated the situation just seemed a bit rush, unexpected and mostly disappointing. All that tension, all that drama just built up to that small scene and it just eluded a fake climax if you know what I mean. I thought the writers could be a bit more creative and made it more realistic instead. In short I didn't like it.-Problem #2: GG Identity,I was actually scared that the writers would reveal who GG is. I thought it was never going to be revealed. However, for once the writers satisfied my curiosity and told us finally who GG really is. However, her identity just didn't click for me. The decision felt rushed and it was a last minute thing. I wouldn't be surprised if the writers just didn't know for themselves for the last 5 seasons who GG is or who should she be. Then they just picked one person and finally settled with that idea and then just like threw it there. They were like just setting in their seats being like \"Oh, let's just choose Person A no one would expect that\" and called it a night. And then somehow everything else needs to make sense but it doesn't.On the Other hand the writers were smart enough that we finally see character development something that was lacking tremendously in the last 2 seasons. The characters are finally and I mean broke away from their High School Mentality and started acting like Mature people and I liked the fact that not everyone got their happy ending which made the series more believable and less predictable.[END OF SPOILERS]But seriously watch this season. It's short, it's great and it's fun. Hidden agendas, plots, secrets and mind games you won't be disappointed.Enjoy!"
B009NPK1IO Gossip Girl has grown up and with those crucial scandalous high school years behind her, cannot make the translation into adulthood (or what approximates it on this show.)  Salacious has turned to sleaze and the bad girls aren't really clever, just mean.  All of the conniving has worn thin and while earlier seasons seemed like underhanded moral plays in pretty cloths, this episode reeks of ugly."
B009NPK1IO I binge watched the first five seasons while I was recovering from knee surgery. It was great and I really enjoyed it. Now I feel like I'm slogging through until the finale."
B009O6QKKK If you want a realistic FBI &#34;Who Done It&#34;, don't watch this,  This is a very hilariously entertaining 45 minutes of entertainment with a delightful cast of characters.  We have trouble limiting ourselves to a single episode a night and will be sad when we finish the series."
B009O6QKKK I'm a big fan of whodunit dramas and lately have been watching an array of British shows that have been excellent.  Whitechapel is one of those.  Interesting and intriguing stories filled with unique and interesting characters.  Season two's murder room added a female detective who's got an unusual mother hen kind of vibe.  And the lead detective DI Chandler has taken a page from Mr Monk."
B009O6QKKK The Brits make the best &#34;who done it&#34; detective shows and this one is very good. The sergeant's character is particularly rich."
B009O6QKKK season, will watch all again because I enjoyed it so much I can rewatch any BBC or Masterpiece series over and over they are so good."
B009O6QKKK Not as good as season one, found the Kray twin story a bit contrived love Rupert Penry Jones lovely! So he made up for the choice of subject material."
B009O6QKKK The characters are unique and their relationship s add greatly to the plot. I THOROUGHLY ENJOY. I wish there were more episodes."
B009O6QKKK Good chemistry in the crew of this series. Season 2 didn't have quite the tension of Season 1 and the idea of connecting the modern crimes with the old gangsters was not quite as dramatic as Jack the Ripper from Season 1. Although those twins sure were a 10 on the creepy chart!"
B009O6QKKK Great acting, stories and mystery, the personalities and characters are great, personality defects, tempers, emotions and clashes etc. what more seasons"
B009O6QKKK Season two finds us with yet another copy cat killer on the loose and our obsessive compulsive DI must use his colorful team of investigators to find the killer (or killers).  I love that this show takes old crimes and has the copycat killer recreate them down to the tiniest details!  The development of the relationship between DI Chandler and his Sgt. Miles is perhaps the best thing about the show, but I love everything about it.  Usually with a series there is always that one character that you wish would get killed off because they are so annoying....not with this show.  There's not a single recurring character that I don't like.  This is my new favorite show!  Love it!"
B009O6QKKK This detective series is pretty good.  I watched all of Season 1 and I am almost finished with Season 2.  If you like Brit detective shows, this is a good one to watch."
B009O6QKKK Great British detective series.  Gritty, sometimes horrifying crime stories.  Have seen all the series I can get on Amazon Prime.  It's a goodie for the lover of cop shows."
B009O6QKKK I find this series great fun and good suspense.  I like the way the relationship between the team members has developed since season 1"
B009O6QKKK If blood and gore are your cup of tea, then this series is for you! If the feelings of how people relate and act with each other under stressful situations, then this series for you!  If you like to see the issues of real hard police work and investigation, this series it for you.  If you want to see a mix of affection, love and caring for others, then this series is for you!  If you have trouble understanding British accents and humor, then it's best you don't watch..sorry."
B009O6QKKK I love the character development, the stories, thought provoking plots, etc.  However, I must turn my head often when the graphic, gruesome, bloody scenes are presented...yuck!"
B009O6QKKK The cast and characters are great together!  It is nicely done!Better than most tv series on regular television and cable!"
B009O6QKKK This has a definite twist in the plot that was unexpected.  Usually, I can anticipate what is gong to happen in a series, but this time I didn't expect the changes in relationships within this season.  It was definitely worth watching.  The biggest compliment I can pay a series is that I will watch it again sometime to see if I missed some small clues that were meaningless the first time i watched it."
B009O6QKKK Good British TV but a  little gory at times.  We'll worth watching and free."
B009O6QKKK A well done show. entertaining, superbly written, engrossing, well developed characters, and a lot of fun. would watch it again"
B009O6QKKK Who doesn't like Rupert Penry-Jones....  episodes move a little slow- but still worth watching and still better than most of what we get on our Prime Time channels.."
B009O6QKKK Interesting group of people, good stories and side stories.  I have to wait for season 4 to hit the states.  Watch it."
B009O6QKKK I love all of the strange stories, and the characters in them. Love the Brits! Hope we will have more seasons of this show."
B009O6QKKK I chose to watch season 2 after I completed season 1, which I enjoyed.  This is a different way at looking at murder investigations with the police.  Each of the main characters has his own quirks and/or  psychological  problems to deal with.  The tension between Mills and the chief detective is emotional.  Hating each other at the beginning and becoming friends is interesting to watch.  They actually like each other and make sure each is safe.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the mysteries created by BBC."
B009O6QKKK I cannot wait for the next season to be available.  It is well acted, well written and suspenseful.  I would recommend."
B009O6QKKK Season 2 featured a murder mystery based on copycat Kray twins.  I was only a little familiar with the Krays and later viewed a 1994 BBC documentary on youtube.  These episodes featured a lot of quick graphics that made the story very choppy.  Excellent acting.  The writing and direction, less so."
B009O6QKKK The first season was a  riveting drama of suspense and mob intrigue. I am constantly amazed at how the Brits come upwith such quality mystery thriller entertainment, light years above domestic  U.S. sex,violence and assorted debauchery."
B009O6QKKK This season continues with the theme of copycat serial killers but picks the notorious Kray twins and a plot to revive their gang-style power in a new age. There is much I did not know about the Krays and their gang-style hold on areas of London. These are the original Diamond Geezers. The plot is fascinating and complex. The acting is remarkable. The relationship between the inspector and his sergeant continues to develop from the rocky start of season 1. Taut and compellingly filmed it moves rapidly but is a thoughtful drama at the same time. I wondered if the series would be a one-trick pony and where it would go from the Jack the Ripper copycat, but it proves to have the legs of a thoroughbred."
B009O6QKKK This is a dark tale to be sure, but I couldn&#8217;t stop watching.  Season 2 builds on the first season with further character development.  The Brits have a gift for plot and storytelling.  DI Chandler is such a complex individual with a sense of right and wrong, loyalty, and OCD as his constant companion.Miles is wonderful because he is a polar opposite of Chandler and throws him a lifeline when necessary.  Ed&#8230;Oh well, even as he is ignored by everyone, he is constantly looking for similarities from previous crimes.  He is almost like a code breaker of human behavior.  The other characters float, but these three Chandler, Miles and Ed seem to move the story along.If you are into a lot of flash/bang type of police procedurals this is not for you.  I have only recently become a fan of English TV series, but they have me hooked.  Yep, they are slower paced than US TV of the same genre, but I am hooked on them."
B009O6QKKK Outstanding detective and police series one of Masterpiece's best up to date stories. Sorry to see there is only one Season left."
B009O6QKKK I like white chapel, while the plot is well thought out, it has just enough twists/turns to keep you from already knowing the ending."
B009O6QKKK Great drama. Excellent acting. Strong story lines. Excellent ensemble group. Wish there was another season. Watched on prime so great bargain"
B009O6QKKK Sometimes a little gory for the sensitive types, but I like the interaction of the characters & love Rupert's character! Good mystery series!"
B009O6QKKK Good acting and interesting stories. Closed captioning helps to understand the various British accents. Scenery from foreign countries makes it interesting."
B009O6QKKK The series plotlines are very interesting and well done. The acting is at best mediocore. Why homicide detectives roam the underworld of murder without weapons is pretty lame and why do all these British mystery series need a &#34;doubting Thomas&#34; sidekick/superior that get in the way of the investigations and need to criticize the lead detective?  The ending to season 1 was quite disappointing. It was like they didn't know how to complete the story so they just  .....SPOILER ALERT ....  had the unsub commit suicide. DUMB !!! some reason to  Give the audience someone to root for. I understand &#34;good&#34; doesn't always prevail, but give us hope.The lead character is not at all interesting and even their attempt to make him OCD falls flat. He bumbles his way through each investigation and doesn't make you care about him one or the other. I give this series 2 and 1/2 stars."
B009O6QKKK Continues the theme of modern copycats for historic crime figures, drawing on the real activities of the Kray brothers in the 1960's.  Nice combination of the old and the new and continuing development of the relationship between Chandler and his team, particularly Miles.  Watching these episodes got me interested in reading about the Krays...lots of fun."
B009O6QKKK My wife and I have enjoyed this series. It is a well thought out, London based, murder mystery series that featured strong acting, character development, and pacing."
B009O6QKKK A must for all the BBC detective addicts out there.  It is possible to see, feel, and smell the gruesome crimes that the Whitechapel detectives get involved.  I think Rupert Perry-Jones is brilliant."
B009O6QKKK This series provides a double whammy for the lover of crime. First, the team of detectives goes after today''s criminals, as in any contemprary police drama. But secondly, the device of the &#34;copycat murder&#34; permits the author to reconstruct the notorious crimes of yesteryear, in this case, the murders committed by the infamous Kray twins in the 1960s.This, second, series worked better than the first because the crimes are better documented and less shrouded in gothic mystery than the &#34;Ripper murders,&#34; the subject of the first series. Hence the detective-work carried out forty years ago seems more relevant than the confused, late nineteenth century documentation that required an eccentric &#34;expert&#34; who distracts not only the policemen but the viewer too. In the second series, the same &#34;expert&#34; returns in the role of &#34;researcher&#34; that makes him more plausible and, at times at least, barely acceptable to other team members.The inspector and his sergeant are an odd couple. The inspector is an upper-class chap with minimal understanding of how folk live in Whitechapel. The sergeant is the opposite: a cockney sparrow with prejudices against the upper classes that, in the first epsiode, seem insurmountable. Then the two become a &#34;duo&#34;...may be a little too quickly and a little too &#34;spiritually.&#34; But the two actors carry this off...for the most part."
B009O6QKKK Great atypical British modern day cop series. Only a few bad guys have guns so there are more stabbings, drug OD's and plain old choking. The cops get along fine without guns mostly. Top cops drive Range Rovers of course and just about the entire cast speaks enough English that can be understood by us poor Yankees. This review is for the entire series currently available to Prime subscribers."
B009O6QKKK GREAT SHOW!!!!! I have watched many BBC crime/mystery shows and this ranks among my favorites. Whitechapel\" takes on the issue of a brilliant Detective Inspector suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder WITHOUT making the condition into a joke (a la \"Monk\"). Rupert Penry-Jones as DI Chandler is believeable, inspiring and, at times, truly heart-breaking.  His supporting cast is also wonderful. This show has an unusual tone -- which I very much enjoyed. It alludes to all those things that happen all the time that we can't explain, so we ignore. THIS show doesn't ignore them and it makes for very interesting TV!"
B009O6QKKK Interesting crimes and more development of characters. Still has lots of unusual crimes with twists and turns as the stories develope."
B009O6QKKK Post Jack the Ripper, the second season focuses on another famous villain (or pair of villains),  the Crays.One tends to equate extreme violence with the USA.  It is refreshing to see just how bloody the Brits can be!! This series is not for the squeamish nor for those who are like - minded. Sadly, much of this violence is likely to thrill too many persons with poor impulse control. Hence I give it 4 stars."
B009O6QKKK I really enjoyed this entire series and surprised with the ending.  The characters portrayed some very 'human' responses, and kept me wanting to follow the outcomes."
B009O6QKKK If you llike crime thrillers this will keep you captivated.  The English perspective is quite good and the characters definitely play well with each other.  Enjoyed Season 1 which peaked my interest with season 2.  If you enjoy &#34; who done its&#34; you won't be disappointed with Whitechapel."
B009O6QKKK This is not up to the quality of &#34;Foyle's War,&#34; but definitely worth the watch.  Good suspense and drama, but too graphic regarding the murder victim scenes to watch while eating or drinking anything."
B009O6QKKK Interesting that even crime repeats itself. Strong writing, more character development in season 2, interesting plot twists... an all-around good program!"
B009O6QKKK I thought this was one of the best shows I have seen in a while.  The cases were very interesting."
B009O6QKKK I enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel and the story line in the second season is just as engaging, except I enjoyed it even more that the first because over time we get to know the characters much better and begin to understand and care more about them."
B009O6QKKK Each episode is a unique twist of an iconic murder case. The characters are so fully formed you care for them as you would family. But the lead, Rupert Penry-Smith is so fascinating you can't look away. One either wants to adopt him or bed him, the emotional attachment is so strong. That too is the writer's idea of what a modern man should be, full of strange weakness, compulsive behavior but with an endearing gentle heart. When will you include the 4th series?"
B009O6QKKK What a treat to watch a totally flawed fictional character bring such &#34;every day&#34; realism to a part. I almost forgot that Perry-Jones wasn't the one with the OCD."
B009O6QKKK I grew up in England during the 'reign' of the Krays.  Although I was too little to understand most of the details, I think the writing and performances captured well the fear that they spread in the East End.  I highly recommend this series and Season 1 as well.  Haven't yet watched Season 3, but hope they keep them coming!!"
B009O6QKKK Good Show.  Good Actors.  I would like to see more episodes.  Different take on the usual Scotland Yard detective show."
B009O6QKKK The relationships of the characters are forming in a great way.  Also, knowing a little &#34;history&#34; in some of the character's lives makes me &#34;like&#34; them more as people.  I will watch anything, ANYTHING, with Rupert Penry-Jones in it."
B009O6QKKK Although my favorite mystery/terror story will probably always be Jack the Ripper (season 1 of Whitechapel), the explanation of the control of the one prominent crime family in Great Britain in the 1960's was very interesting and engaging.  It is almost too hard to believe that the Kray brothers had such a complete hold on the entire country.  This was a very well handled, very interesting story.  I liked the development of the two main detectives as the story moved along."
B009O6QKKK Intelligent writing. Engaging characters who are three dimensional. very interesting premise. Mini movie with just as good quality as any movie, cinematography and acting."
B009O6QKKK Must watch from the beginning...good story line and great actors..if you like history and detectives, you will love this..series...modern times."
B009O6QKKK This second season continues to get better.  The character development and the OCD of the lead appears to be leading up to something.  The group continues to work extremely well together, each with their particular expertise, solving all the crimes in the nick of time."
B009O6QKKK I loved the angle of where history meets crime and being able to learn from previous cases to solve what is currently happening!"
B009O6QKKK Greater than the first series.  The Kray boys. I don't think  that anyone outside of Boston Knows of them. Google them. You'll see. Absolute boogeymen, that mother criminals tell their kids about. Like the (hopefully) fake Kaizer Sozey. This episode carries the theme on in a great sequel. It's a shame it's the last though. Come-on! Has Brittan run out of scary stories? I think not. Go get 'em, Brits!"
B009O6QKKK All of the lovable characters are back.  D.I. Chandler, the toff boy, who earns his stripes and the respect of his department in Season 1.  Old dog D.I. Miles who acts as a mentor and becomes his loyal supporter is now behind him 100%.  Then there's the amateur crime aficionado, Edward Pemberton, who adds fun and sparkle to every scene he is in.  There's a copycat killer on the loose again, perhaps two.  The MO harks  back to old crimes, so they have to call on the knowledge of the amateur crime historian, Mr. Pemberton, who adds levity to keep the show from being too grisly.While there's more gore than I usually will watch, and I'm not sure this season is as cohesive as Season 1, I watch it primarily for the characters, script, and setting.  I got a little confused on who were the bad guys, but that was part of the mystery.  If you like to escape to England for a police procedural, you may want to sample this series."
B009O6QKKK Rupert Penry-Jones is an old friend from MI5. He has credibility as both characters and that's no easy feat since the characters are completely different from one another."
B009O6QKKK Great characterization, solid story line. An excellent series. Needs to be continued. This series is thought provoking. Keep it going."
B009O6QKKK whitechapel's second season is a complete surprise: historical fiction, the swingin 6os, london, england, take its darkest, most corrupt and chilling chapter, ending with the iconic murder of the 1960s, see if you can catch it. great stuff.  if you like luther, you will enjoy this whitechapel season, lots."
B009O6QKKK Excellent cast.A good story that kept me waiting for the next chapter.  Perfectly played, both culturally & generational.I look more from this writer."
B009O6QKKK This is a stellar detective show. Serious, but not gruesome. It is very adult, but they all have a sense of humor also. First rate."
B009O6QKKK The things done well in this series are the best ever. Intrigue, intensity, and the hero's compassion for victims are shared by audience. One would think, however, that similarities between previous case(season one) and this one would have been acknowledged by the seasoned career detectives."
B009O6QKKK The show is worth watching. The acting is well done. The story line is good and interesting. I wouldn't recommend it as a family show since some of the content isn't suitable for young audiences."
B009O6QKKK They did a nice job this series fleshing out the characters from series 1.  There was one addition to the team, however, and nothing much was done with him.  Perhaps that will change in series 3?Good story and nicely paced.  I would recommend Whitechapel."
B009O6QKKK I saw this series and never heard of it so I decide to give it a try. I am glad I did I was hook after the first episode. It is a British series and very well written and the actors are great.  It is about Organized Crime Division that solve crimes in the east end district of Whitechapel, more like a Law and Order. It is a great series and think everyone should give it a try, can't hurt."
B009O6QKKK this series is among the very best of British mystery thrillers.  Joe Chandler seems to be in over his head sometimes but Ray Miles as his Sargent is an able leveler.  I hope there will be more than the three seasons to enjoy."
B009O6QKKK Please watch this! The stories are good and the acting is excellent. The way that the series is filmed is so different and interesting, it's like a film noir. Definitely an enjoyable time watching this entire series.."
B009O6QKKK The first season characters are back with a few additions. The back stores of each character continue to come out with some surprises. As before the stories are tight and it is a challenge to watch a single episode and not continue immediately to the next."
B009O6QKKK I would give this 5 stars but it is a little too bloody and tends to end the episode with a stunner that doesn't make you want to go to bed. I like it best when I can move onto the next episode and not just before bed. I love it but it is a bit disturbing. I will watch all the episodes. My rating is for the series not an individual episode."
B009O6QKKK Excellent writing and acting...well done British crime drama that was consistently entertaining and held our attention though out the series."
B009O6QKKK Enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel and was not let down by this second season.  Am looking forward to Season 3."
B009O6QKKK I enjoyed this show.  I like the characters.  Sometimes seemed a little dark but I enjoyed it.  If you like detective shows, you might like it"
B009O6QKKK It's hard to describe this series because it is good in some ways and not so good in others.  The volume control could have been better, for one thing.  The characters are alright.  I thought the original premise was very good."
B009O6QKKK This perfectly acted,,intelligently written British series,is simply as good as it gets. Normally television series decline in quality over time but this one doesn't. The plot is much more intriguing than it sounds, by the way. So settle in for a very fascinating detective thriller."
B009O6QKKK A little hard to follow the dialogue (british accent and all) and no subtitles, but the show is quite engaging."
B009O6QKKK A bit quirky, but well acted and interesting story concept. Too reliant on the theme of crime history repeating itself, but i enjoyed it. I would recommend it to the arm chair criminologist (which I am!).."
B009O6QKKK Graphic violence yet well done. I finished the first season about Jack the Ripper, then started the 2 Season about mobs and lost interest. A bit too much for me. The actors are very good, the writing is also. Very dark."
B009O6QKKK Interesting characters, but very dark and depressing stories.  I watch lots of mystery series, and when I say this is one of the darkest I have seen I am not exaggerating.  I am glad I watched the series, but it is not one of my favorites."
B009O6QKKK One of the best series I have seen so far. The lead character is so twitchy and so out there you sometimes feel the same pain he's going through and are thankful that he has someone to help him through the adjustments he has to make while solving crimes and trying to live his life outside of the office."
B009O6QKKK Somewhat of a &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; in the streets of London, the story center around the detectives solving serial murders or violent crimes in Jack the Ripper's old hunting grounds. The character development and the evolution of the relationships between the new and senior detectives are well done. As seems typical with BBC productions, the series consists only of a few episodes. There is one storyline running through the entire season, giving the series a mini-series feel (compared to the one story per episode format of American tv series). Well performed and well written."
B009O6QKKK Boring and dry. characters did not entice me to continue to watch this program. I find that British shows can be really good or boring."
B009O6QKKK I really like this series and look forward to viewing the rest of it. Its interesting and well acted. Designed for adult viewing."
B009O6QKKK the characters,tension and terrific writing are sewn together with an amazing cast and setting. With the whole &#34;Whitechapel&#34; murders fluttering behind every shadow a 'top drawer' DI learns as much from his scruffy team as they learn from him. Take a scary chance and watch this BBC series-- typical quality!"
B009O6QKKK I watched all four seasons-unfortunately Amazon doesn't have the last season, but great acting and it gets better and better each 'season.'"
B009O6QKKK Yes, I loved this series. So very scary and so well acted. Well worth the hour and half at each sitting."
B009O6QKKK I love English movies and police stories.  I have always ordered P D James movies and anything else English when I was on Netflix.  Now I can watch what I want on my Kindle, love it."
B009O6QKKK It was entertaining but sometimes hard to keep track of what was going on.  Filmed a bit darkly, but that was probably for effect."
B009O6QKKK Well done. Well written. I got addicted and watched the whole series in about two weeks. I highly recommend it."
B009O6QKKK I am engaged enough to keep watching, but I am not altogether enamored of the acting, which occasionally seems inconsistent and/or overdone. Good enough, though."
B009O6QKKK Interesting characters, excellent writing, excellent acting - Phil Davis is good fun to watch - as is Rupert Penry-Jones and his (not so) subtle OCD"
B009O6QKKK I really like the series but I find the outcome very predictable. I know half way through it 'who done it'!"
B009OYRXBM Except for the somewhat unsatisfying ending, this unpretentious little indie makes for entertaining viewing. Parker Posey is good as the somewhat hysterical boss of a marketing department at a small Long Island supermarket chain. She isn't really over the top, and the comedy remains somewhat believable. The better scenes are set in LA where she seduces the plain vanilla married guy she's recruited as her underling. The best scene is when her ex confronts the pair at a restaurant. The ending left me a bit at a loss because it seems so straight-forward. There's no hidden snark, no comedy, just a reversion to real life, as if the writers couldn't think of something better."
B009OYRXBM I'll bet you never wondered what goes on behind the scenes in your local supermarket: why items are placed where they are, what equipment is used for the checkers, when specials are planned and how careers are made or ruined based on the success or failure of these decisions.Screening audiences attending this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA will never wonder; we got to watch these corporate shenanigans in living color!We saw:* Parker Posey (\"Inside Out\") is a recently hired dynamo brought in to re-energize this mid-size supermarket chain. Her take-no-prisoners style is immediately obvious when she fires a high-timer unjustly, simply so she can re-invest his significant salary on promotional material.* Eric Mabius (Lots of TV) is a frustrated music industry professional, temporarily (he hopes) side-tracked into supermarket management. He is seduced by the siren song of success, with a salary increase and unexpected temptation. All his boss wants in return (she says) is his loyalty.* Annie Parisse (\"The Amazing Spider-Man\") is our hero's wife, proud of his work ethic and really proud of his promotion! She even might be willing to overlook a thing or two....* Cheyenne Jackson (\"Lola Versus\") is a man from that dynamo's past, who has nothing nice to say about her! He stands his ground with her though, which is more than most men.* Julia Bray (Lots of TV) is quite the surprise. Downtrodden, overlooked and derided, she suddenly finds her inner loyal employee and delivers a great motivational speech.As a veteran of the corporate world, I felt the discussions around the planning table had a ring of authenticity, although the percent increase they are discussing sounds waaaay out of line for the grocery business! Safeway and Kroegers should be so lucky!I'll be glad when Amazon carries the DVD. I want to add this to my Cheyenne Jackson collection."
B009OYRXBM The 2012 movie PRICE CHECK takes us behind the scenes of the supermarket industry.  However, not a film about what goes into barcodes, PRICE CHECK presents a young male executive on the rise in the corporate office side of the business.  His new female boss, played with high energy by the fine actor Parker Posey, is about to affect both his career and marriage.  Until that point, he wishes he could still be working at the small record label he left to take this job and start a family.  Now the man is not so sure, between the possibilities with the new direct superior and how well it goes when he meets the big boss, the ever-impressive Edward Herrmann in that role.Even if I wanted to blow the story, getting into what happens after that in PRICE CHECK would be beside the point.  I think the movie takes place in the roller coaster enterprise of retail sales to underscore how so much in our lives can be upended by what we can't control, the only choices being to take it or leave it.The closing scenes of PRICE CHECK could very well prove the opening of its next chapter were it a miniseries or epic-length film.  Instead, its midsentence cut-off reminds us there's no conclusion to real life, just what comes our way next, even though we planned something else.See PRICE CHECK."
B009OYRXBM Sorry to say, I could not watch the entire movie.Parker Posey played a complete wacked out lady within a loser script that should never have been written."
B009OYRXBM Here is a comedy-drama that didn't quite live up to being either a comedy or drama.  There are funny moments, and dramatic moments, but the film never found it's bearing and left me wondering if it could have been better.Parker Posey's character is offbeat, funny, and spot-on for an over the top, not listening to you type of power-driven manager/executive.  She does her best to carry the film, and does most of the time, but it's the poor writing that keeps it from making it memorable.The ending is disappointing.  Without spoiling the film, we jump ahead to the future and are left to assume that loose ends are tied up and problems resolved nice and neat.  However, it is a cheap way to leave us wondering: is that it?"
B009OYSFDM Very well done to be sure but just didn't enjoy it well enough to continue viewing."
B009OYSFDM Great series. I didn't expect it to be based on comics, but so far I like the series a lot. I can't wait to see the first episode of Season 2."
B009OYSFDM Very fun show with a good cast. Can't wait to buy season 2 and can't wait until season 3 comes out on tv."
B009OYSFDM I wasn't expecting much from this show.  While I love the movies based on comics, the TV shows haven't done so well.  This one excels because of the character development.  Who knew?  Character development in a comic?!?  Arrow is a conflicted human being who is trying very hard to work out his issues.  He doesn't always get it right and he pays a high price from time to time.  A hero who fails, see what I mean about character development?  The supporting characters are well rounded also and over time the viewer begins to feel that they know and either like or dislike these people.  The action is also good and the plot lines are interesting.  Although it is a show with violence in it; it does not contain the horrible graphic violence a lot of shows today do.  I'd recommend it."
B009OYSFDM My only hope is that they don't feel that they have to follow the comic book religiously. I've never read the comic. The chemistry in the show between Oliver and Felicity is amazing. Between Oliver and Laurel--not there. Her character seems shallow and self-absorbed. Love Oliver, Diggle and Felicity."
B009OYSFDM I'm not saying this show is bad, it's watchable, but it can be very cheesy at times. I still think it has a lot of potential to be better than it is, and I'm hoping as the show progresses (if it doesn't get canned) it gets better. I'll be surprised if it lasts beyond season 1 though as every week is the same old thing again. I wish more time was spent on the backstory/island than on his new life. Maybe that's just me yearning for another &#34;Lost&#34; though."
B009OYSFDM Finally was able to watch all the 23 episodes in three days via Amazon Instant Video.I was so invested on Beauty and the Beast that I didn't know what I was missing.It's the best show so far that has come out of the CW.Arrow has that Batman-esque feel to it.Can't wait for second season and see what will become of Roy Harper ,will he don a red suit,and will he continue seing Thea?How about Laurel Lance's relationship with Oliver Queen?Tommy Merlin dead?I don't think so! So for those who failed the city...Arrow will come for you!"
B009OYSFDM I really enjoy this show, but I feel it has too much contrived conflicts. I wish it were a bit lighter in tone, but it is still a great series, and I hope there will be a Season Two. I don't really need all the flashbacks to the island, but I guess they have a purpose."
B009OYSFDM I think they did a decent job with this show. The Green Arrow was not always the top pick for DC Comics fans, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the show based around this character. Hope this does well and hope to see more like this in the future. Very entertaining."
B009OYSFDM Not fantastic but a descent hero fix. Gets better as the season progresses. I could do with less family drama and more arrows..."
B009OYSFDM After setting up the backstory and all of the relationships, Arrow is settling into its apparent pattern which will be a combination of servicing its longer arcs and detailing Arrow's attempts to save the city through a crime or adventure of the week. In this episode, an innocent man, tangentially connected to the names on the Arrow's naughty list from his father, is about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit. The Arrow goes after the miscreants with mixed success and a twist at the end that leaves the viewer panting for the next episode.The Arrow is good and solid, but has yet to achieve the level of great at least for this viewer. I am hard put to put my finger on just where the lack is, but something both subtle and essential seems to be missing. The actors are all solid enough and the darkly spun comic book hero on his quest for justice is tried and true but the whole thing is like eating rice that hasn't got quite enough salt. Don't get me wrong, the arrow is solid, just not yet great. I will be watching to see if the show survives its growing pains."
B009OYSFDM So far we are enjoying this.  It's got just enough mystery and backstory to be interested and the storylines are not totally lame.  The fact that John Barrowman is in it is enough to keep me going."
B009OYSFDM I had no idea what this show was about but after watching the first episode I purchased the entire season.  I'm only sorry that season 2 has not come out yet!"
B009OYSFDM CW's hit superhero series ARROW succeeds largely based on one impressive aspect: the powerful performance of it's lead player, Stephen Amell, as playboy-turned-vigilante Oliver Queen.Stephen Amell has gravitas, good looks, and charisma, and on top of that, is a phenomenal actor. He perfectly portrays the hardened and edgy human weapon that came off that Pacific island a changed man from the naive playboy who set foot on it. His scenes as Green Arrow are the highlight of the film: usually stylized, cinematic action scenes where various henchman get shot in varyingly badass ways. I'm not calling Amell the next Christian Bale, though both nail brutal fighting tactics, costumes, and masks like pros. I *am* saying he is an incredible actor that really takes the material a step up from what he's given and keeps the audience quietly riveted to the screen.But let me just say that I thought that Queen's wisecracking friend was incredibly annoying, and Laurel was both terribly miscast and extremely cliched (the super-hot law official's daughter who is also really smart and has conflicted love interests). Also, the dialogue was slightly hammy at times, and some acting whiffed of cheese. CW needs to make the show darker and gritter - more edgy and up the stakes with the villains. More gritty Gotham, less shining Metropolis.But I'm not complaining.I love the fast-paced plots and mood, and anytime we: A. See Oliver training in some illogical but awesome way. B. See Green Arrow take out dudes with a bow. - well, let me just say it's incredibly entertaining. ARROW breaks the Curse of Superhero TV Series, and has opened the gateway to other shows such as Marvel's Agent's of S.H.I.E.L.D., an upcoming Flash series, a Lieutenant Gordon prequel, and a John Constantine series (still in the works).I expect to be sticking around with this show for some time in the future! The sharp characters and excellent acting from Stephen Amell make Arrow a suspenseful, cinematic, and action-packed crowd pleaser! Arrow has hit the bullseye! 4+ stars!"
B009OYSFDM Awesome show.  Hope they continue to follow the comic book.  Would like to see a team up with another super hero down the road."
B009OYSFDM It's like Robin Hood and Batman rolled into one.  Of course there is the eye candy for the ladies but enough mystery and action that men will enjoy as well.  A favorite in our house."
B009OYSFDM started out better than the finish but it was fun and entertaining. liked the strong female influencing characters. i would get another season"
B009OYSFDM I enjoy this show, don't get me wrong, but I'm not sure if I love it yet.  The acting seems, sometimes, a bit subpar.  I enjoy the concept, and it's great to see a reboot of the green arrow.  Also, love seeing deathstroke."
B009OYSFDM My wife and I both like this series very much.  Unfortunately, there seems to be little chance of it returning for another season.  I would like to be wrong, but I have seen no indication that it will be returning.Bob Morton"
B009OYSFDM I enjoy watching a series with a charismatic protagonist and clever solutions to dilemmas.  I never quite know what is going to happen next.  I would like more info from when he was on the island, but I expect to see that during more episodes."
B009OYSFDM I watched the entire season when it was on TV and was hooked in from minute 1. It's a great show and I pre-ordered it as soon as it ended even though I knew it wouldn't arrive for months."
B009OYSFDM At first i was skeptic of this show, Oliver Green- the Green arrow, if you like smallvile probably the best show ever!!!!!!! you will like this show, it starts off slow, but gets better and better which is good now days, considering most shows start off with a bang, this one builds up and keeps getting better :)"
B009OYSFDM I admit -- I am a sucker for most &#34;superhero&#34; shows.  I find Arrow very entertaining.  There are definitely some cheesy factors...but all in all, the show is enjoyable."
B009OYSFDM After watching the first two eps I have to say I really enjoyed them. No real new story - very batmanesque - a lone hero trying to clean up a corrupt big city, complete with him even being a wealthy scion. Despite that similarity though, the show feels fresh and new and they have cast some good actors across the board.It feels much more real than the Batman and other superhero movies and that it's a series means we'll get to see a new ep every week. Looking foreward to the next and hopefully many seasons more."
