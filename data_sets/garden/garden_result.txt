B000NCTGQE I already have a couple of these that I've been using for years.  The units hold up well, but the covers don't hold up as long.  I don't use them to start my plants in.  I do that inside with heated mats and overhead lighting that can be adjusted.  I use these racks to harden off my seedlings prior to planting or hold plants I've purchased until planting time.  If you start your own tomato, pepper and other plants from seed, they can gradually acclimate to living outdoors using these handy racks.Only the top shelves will accomdate taller plants, but my seedlings are planted in the garden before they get too tall.  Sometimes I've needed the height if I purchased plants that were already quite tall.Most of my vegetable gardening is done in earthboxes.  We have a serious squirrel and slightly lessor rabbit problem in our area.  The squirrels will continually dig whereever I've planted things and the birds will quickly grab any seeds that are exposed.They destroyed all of the snap peas I planted a couple of weeks ago.  Only one seedling survived their havoc.  The other day I discovered that the shelves from these racks fit nicely over an earthbox.  The mesh openings are small enough to keep the squirrels and birds from digging up the seeds before they germinate.  I simply laid the mesh shelf over the top of the earthbox and secured it into place.  The soil level is a couple of inches lower and the seedlings can either grow through the mesh or I can simply remove the shelf once they've established themselves.I am considering buying another unit just for the mesh shelves.  I direct seed things like cucumbers, beans, peas, radishes and squash in the earthboxes and often have to plant multiple times before I have enough growing.  These shelves should solve that problem.For hardening off seedlings, I only close the covers if we expect a cool night and my racks are used on a covered front porch and against the back of the house.  I position them so they are less susceptable to wind to help sheild the plants from cold wind and keep them from blowing over.  After a brief period, I bring the plants out of the unit for gradually increasing lengths of time so they get a little wind and the stems get sturdy.  You do need to shift the plants because they will always grow toward the light and they need fresh air and wind to become strong enough to survive in the garden.Those who have had trouble with plants wilting due to too much moisture need to give the plants more access to fresh air and air circulation.  Just remove the cover when the temps allow it or remove the trays of plants for a few hours a day.
B000NCUW1M We had little Pharaoh ants in our RV.  I tried other baits and few home made ant killers.  These little Pharaoh ants had a picnic.  I bought this Terro and the party was over!  The ants formed a heavy line and in a day or two they were gone!  Be sure and keep them supplied with bait until they stop coming.Recommended!
B000NCUW1M I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!
B000NCUW1M When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon.
B000NCWOKE I demand a lot out of my hoses, and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well, I didn't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me. I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer. The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours, the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet. I'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me.
B000NCWP44 Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
B000NCWP44 What can I say, rubber hose washers, they work just fine.  This is hard to give rate reasons as they are just washers.
B000NCWP44 great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
B000NCWP44 Not much to comment on gaskets except that they serve there purpose in our garden hoses.  Somewhat larger than those you buy at a discount store.
B000NCWP44 bought these for my non heavy duty hoses that didn't have washers built in.these performed exactly as i wanted/expected.  leaks stopped, but functionality remained.perfect.
B000NCWP44 This is a pretty handy pack of washers to have around, they are probably going to work better for you then any washer included in a new garden hose or garden sprayer.  Works even better if you put a thin layer of teflon-based lubricant on it like Magic Lube or something similar.  Prevents leaks.
B000NCWP44 I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!
B000NCWP44 use these to replace all the old ones that leak or are disintegrated. used for hose and hose connections  great with add on
B000NCWP44 Cannot beat the price, they do what they are designed for and they are durable.I have used and re-used these washers on multiple hoses and sprinklers.
B000NCWP44 These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
B000NCWP44 replaced one 2day on the 2nd of 2 ordered Gilmour* Platinum hoses from last year - should have sent that back. Now to 'crack of' the collar' to hopefully get problem fixed as this not a solution -Gilmour 20-58075 20 Series 8-Ply 5/8-Inch-by-75-Foot Flexogen Hose, Platinum
B000NCWP44 These washers fit perfectly and snuggly in your hose and nozzle as needed.  I had to use a flat blade screwdriver to firmly fit the washer in place.  That way it was tightly in place.  It keeps leaks from occurring at the spigot and at the nozzle.
B000NCWP44 If you use garden hoses, then you will eventually need these. The provider washers wear out or get lost. These are a cheap solution.
B000NCWP44 I am very glad to have these as &#34;back-ups&#34; for the usually cheap and thin one that comes with most hoses.  I used one on top of the one the hose had, and there is absolutely no leaking when watering my plants.  Love them and a very inexpensive solution.
B000NCWP44 Best use for auto irrigation projects.  No leaks secure the in near home prevents leaks to basement.Always have these available for projects where pressure finds its way past cheap washers. Well made and thicker.This brand and type best
B000NCWP44 These are good quality washers that are very well made. I bought these to replace some cracked washers of my garden hose. These are much better quality than the original ones that came with the hose.
B000ND3MGS This thing has done great so far. It survived the winter well indoors. I may plant it in the backyard this year and see how hardy it really is.
B000NJ3R26 You're not going to leave this out over the winter. Perfect for spreading the sprinkling through a large vegetable garden. Easy to aim.
B000NJTFPE This animal is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I originally replaced my perfectly good electric (with a cord) mower with the CMM1000 model 10 years ago and stopped dragging my cord around.It was like Christmas opening the box. Then I was disappointed in the fact that everything was put together. You did not need three hands to assemble obscurely named parts. They don't even care what angle you hold the mower at, as the battery does not spill. My lawn was so small that it is not even on the chart of square feet cut on a single charge. Following the instruction I plugged it in for 24 hrs prior to use. I was gearing up for an afternoon of mowing. I waved my arms around like Norton on the Honeymooners, disconnected the charger, inserted the safety key, pushed it to the lawn, and turned it on. It was so quiet that I had to make the motor sound my self. I used the mulcher mode so the rear bag is hanging on the wall. 15 minutes and it was all over. I am going to run out and find the best compost I can find so I can mow more often.-------------------------------------------------------A few changes have been made to the new model; the key is smaller. And some of the electronics were moved from the mower to the charger. I have not dismantled this one yet however the last one was very simple to dismantle as I replaced the batteries once after seven years.Black & Decker MB-850 19-Inch  Lawn Mower Replacement Blade
B000NJTFPE I just got this mower and this thing works great.  I charged it up overnight and then went about my lawn mowing.  I don't have that big of a lawn, would say about .08 of an acre so it had more than enough charge to cut the grass.  The mower is simple to use and requires no assembly except for the grass catcher bag.  Just remember to pull out the mulcher when you first use it if you want to catch the grass in the bag.The mower weighs about 80 pounds, and gets heavier as it fills with grass.  Flat lawns are effortless, but pushing it up an incline might prove troublesome for some.  It's not self propelled so it does take more effort, but once you start pushing and it's cutting the grass, it's not even noticeable.You just insert the safety key, and pull up the handle on the right side and off you go.  Instant on and off.  There is no option to plug in a cord so you will have to have it charged for each use if you want to cut your lawn.  Just make sure to charge it after each use and always leave it plugged in.  It's alot quieter than the gas mowers I have used and I think it is quiet enough that you can even cut the grass early morning without waking people up.Forget the trips to the gas station and no need to worry about gasoline catching on fire.  The charge is advertised to work up to 1/3 acre so if your lawn is smaller than that size, this is definitely the better choice.  Zero emissions and low noise.Again, Just remember to plug it in after every use and leave it plugged in year round and you should have a well maintained battery.
B000NJTFPE Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves, the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both (I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard) mowers within one year. A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post, held by a light-weight spring. The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly, and eventually breaks off at both ends, resulting in a mower that will not operate.  I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment, and cannot fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch.
B000NJTFPE The four stars is actually for our CMM1000 which was the first generation of this mower.  It's been a trooper for us and the only thing we do is sharpen the blades once a year and we've swapped out the batteries only once!&lt;COMPARO>I've put a quick guide of the most popular models on Amazon.

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient. They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is almost NO maintenance. (We spent $80 over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.) Corded electric mowers are a lot cheaper but then you have a cord.>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower? They weigh a LOT more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it. They don't have as much power as gas and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature.>>What is a watt-hour? It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal? Yes - for two reasons. 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered. Second, when you consider that you have to overlap each pass by ~3\", a 20\" blade now effectively cuts 13% more on each pass. If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18\"  Also, my measurements show most mowers overstate their blade size by 1/2\" (Our 20\" measures 19-5/8, our 19 measures 18-1/2)>>Why might I want a removable battery? If you have a large yard, this means you can have a second battery charging while you are using the first. A second battery typically costs $100-$150 but it can make the difference between going electric or not. Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>How long will my batteries last?  That depends on your climate and usage.  We had a small lot for many years and were religious about recharging right after use.  We also live in a cooler climate (Michigan) so the mowing season is shorter.  Our batteries lasted about 7 years.  Most people should get 3-4 years easily but if you're careless and live in Arizona, you could probably kill the batteries in a year or two.>>Why should I care about higher voltage? Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster. With the same chemistry and current, a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic? Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue. Plastic ends up giving you a more stuff to trim since you can't cut as close to fences, etc.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!
B000NVDGFM I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
B000NVDGFM I got this cover to go with my birdfeederPerky-Pet 312C Panorama Bird Feeder, Copperto keep the squirrels off of it and to protect the feeder from the rain.  So far I haven't seen any squirrels any where near it, but it didn't quite shelter my feeder like I hoped and the seeds got soaked during a recent light rain.  Still, it is attractive (well, as attractive as these things go) and it had kept the squirrels out of my feeder so far.
B000NVDGFM This keeps the rain out of my dish-style hummingbird feeder perfectly.  It's also a deep dome so the feeder tucks up inside it just perfectly.  The hummingbirds can access it while the rain cannot.
B000NVDGFM I love this.  The seed in the feeder no longer gets soaked during rain storms and the birds at the feeder stay dry, too.
B000NVDGFM We had just purchased a couple of replacement bird feeders and wanted to get something smaller than the large domes for protecting the feeders from some of the rain.  While nothing will protect a feeder from a driving rain, this cover does very well for steady down pours and for light rain on our tube style bird feeders.The unit is very well made and is simple to assemble.  Both of the hooks pictured on the dome are included and they screw into the metal plate in the dome after you screw on a locking nut to each hook.  Once you thread in the hook you use the nut you previously put on to tighten against the metal plate.  This locks the hook in place so that it will come out with use.Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a rain shield.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a squirrel baffle, but so far it has worked sell as such due to its steep sides.
B000NVM2L6 Little birdies love this feeder. I wonder if they get confused by their reflection in the window.I like that this feeder is window-mounted because not only can I watch them from inside, but the feeder is up and away from squirrels or stray kitties.
B000NVM2L6 Easy to use.
B000NVM2L6 I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window.  But very few want to perch on it.  Plus, it doesn't drain well.  After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window.
B000NVM2L6 This was a gift I appreciated greatly  after my old one was ravaged by a storm.Since I had already acquired regular birdie visits from my previous one, the birds came back to feed without hesitation. The most common visitors are sparrows and chickadees.The clean application of this feeder onto the glass is key to a secure hold. Also make sure you place it within easy reach for cleaning and refilling.I'm not the only one enjoying birds at the window, my cats who are never outdoors are also entertained.Great gift for any bird lover, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a close, indoor view of birds.
B000NVM2L6 Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
B000NVM2L6 I put this on a second-story window and it took less than two days for the birds to find it. So far, mainly the titmice, chickadees and house finches are eating from it. But I am hopeful that eventually I'll get some cardinals to find it. Its very easy to install...just read the instructions in these reviews about how to do it. Worked like a charm. I plan on buying more and putting them in various windows around the house.Update: I have now purchased 4 of these. The birds love them. I have never seen a Cardinal come to any of the feeders (they are hanging on first and second floor windows). I have mostly the birds mentioned above and wren, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers if I put peanut butter suet in it. I have gotten mostly hairy and downy woodpeckers, which are small enough to actually sit inside the box. But I got a red bellied woodpecker the other day. He was MUCH too large to fit in the box, so hung off the side and rocked forward to grab the suet and then leaned back to eat it. He rocked back and forth a few times, flew away...and came back many times. I have suet in cages all around the house. But for some reason he wanted to go through the trouble of eating at this little plastic bird feeder. DETERMINATION!
B000NVM2L6 We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food.  The idea is great but you have to find a window that isn't near a tree with squirrels around.
B000NVM2L6 My 2 cats love this feeder as it brings the outside birds right up to their ledge on the inside of the window. I received the feeder yesterday and filled it with sunflower seed and hung it even though heavy rains and winds were forecast.  Not only did the feeder NOT blow down, the seed inside remained dry!  YAY - no more wasted, moldy seed!
B000NVM2L6 This is a neat concept although I have not had any birds use it here yet. It's winter so I'm guessing by the spring it will fill up. I wish it was slightly bigger so that larger birds like a dove, cardinal could use. It would need another suction cup though.
B000NVM2L6 No, the Perky Pet Window Feeder won't last forever -- a year or so before the suckers weather -- but while it's stuck to your window you'll be able to get a close look at our feathered friends, which can be so much fun for kids and adults.We stuck ours on the window next to the breakfast table.  The children got to where they'd sit so they could watch the chickadees and sparrows drop by to have breakfast with them.  And my husband and I enjoyed sitting quietly drinking coffee and doing not much else but waking up and watching them dart to and fro.I liked these small feeders well enough that every year I now buy them for the children's teachers.  Though I must admit that in kindergarten they didn't stay up long because they were too much fun and the little ones were paying more attention to who was dropping by to eat than their teachers (lol!)THE SKINNY:::Sticks well enough.  Can be difficult to fill if you don't think about this aspect before deciding on a site.  Didn't need cleaning unless there was a real downpour.  (You don't want the seed to get moldy and gross.)We highly recommend.Pam T and family~
B000NVM2L6 This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
B000NZZG3S This thermostat is a pretty nice construction.  The thermometer lead has a nice length to it.  The thermometer is pretty accurate and has nice response times.
B000NZZG3S I use this with the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat and it works great with it. The temperature could be faster at updating though. Sometimes I have to wait 10-15 minutes for a stable temperature after using fresh soil.
B000NZZG3S No more turning on and off the heat mat.  This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.  If you want to keep a consistent heat under your little seedlings; this is the way to do it.
B000NZZG3S A must too help regulate temps for sprouting seeds and rooting clones .This will help speed up the time for root development, better the chance for successful germination & better success in rooting clones as well.Well worth my investment .
B000NZZG3S This keeps my heat mat at a steady temperature for seed germination. I used it for all my seeds this winter and it worked like a charm. I would recommend this product to anyone that grows plants from seed.
B000NZZG3S This made the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat more usable.  I hated that I could not tell at what temperature my seedlings were.  With just the heat mat I knew it would not be cold but did not know how hot.  This thermostat is awesome.  I feel like I have all the information I need to grow seeds and cuttings in a perfect environment, with a humidity dome.  I got this thermostat right after I got the germination station with heat mat. Then I also bought the higher dome cover.  7&#34; so my cuttings would fit.
B000NZZG3S Bought this along with the heat mat and glad I did. My greenhouse gets pretty warm during the day so this helps keep the mat from overheating my seed trays. It's really nice, easy to use and constantly displays the temp of your medium. It has a sensor that you push into the medium so it's measuring the temp of the soil at all times. Well worth it!
B000NZZG3S Used this thermostat for about five months, in a greenhouse, in conjunction with a heat mat.  It maintained the set temperature pretty well.  The only fault I can find is that the readout can be difficult to see in a bright environment such as a greenhouse.
B000NZZG3S I have half a dozen of these thermostats to control 48&#34;x20&#34; heat mats.  The temperature maintained seems very accurate.  Heavy AC cable is overkill for controlling a 120W mat.
B000NZZG3S With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
B000NZZG3S If you bought the Seedling Heat Mat your going to need this thermostat to complete your set up, with this it's a synch to have your heat mat keep its correct temperature, very easy to set then you just sit back and let it do its job.
B000OM82J0 Seems this product is best for getting your seeds to take off and root fast, looking forward to seeing how it helps with the garden outdoors. Does well with house plants
B000OM82J0 Using Superthrive to boost my plants health this summer and it will boost my crops production.  You don't need much for it to be effective.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper is better than a broom in some ways, and not better in other ways.When it's better than a broom...After running my lawn edger, my sidewalks are full of grass clippings that I would rather not blow back onto the lawn to turn brown and ugly. Running this sweeper on my long sidewalks is much better than using a broom. It does a good job of collecting the clippings and saves my hands from blisters.When it's not better than a broom...Tight areas such as the garage.When the grass or leaves are wet.If there are clumps of soil.Mostly, I'd say it's better. I'm glad I have it simply for the clean-up after edging. It's worth it for me just for that.
B000OV8OTY Sticky Stakes successfully wooed and killed tiny gnats growing in my potted plants.  Although the view of used Sticky Stakes is not pleasant, the work is done.  I highly recommend this product.
B000OV8OTY Works amazing.  Attracts fruit flies and fungus gnats.  However, know that this is really only a &#34;band-aid&#34; to your problem and may not solve your problem with one or two applications.  If you have fruit flies, the root of the problem will probably be left over food somewhere, check dishwasher, under the counter, take the garbage out more frequently.  If you have fungus gnats, it will most likely be moist environments and decaying plant matter, i.e. stop watering your plants so frequently.
B000OV8OTY We were having trouble with white flies and other insects that were killing our tomatoes and other potted plants, This little trap catches them easily and since we do not like insecticides, it is part of 
B000OWF7YI I have a container vegetable garden each summer for years since I don't have space for a garden in ground.  I have relied on Miracle-Gro for years to feed and fertilize my container grown vegetables.  Easy and convenient to use... just dissolve in water and feed to your plants every 7-14 days.  You would be amazed how many vegetables- peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, tomatoes and the like you can grow in a few pots on your deck or patio.  Also great for your houseplants.
B000OWF7YI You can't go wrong with miracle-geo for annuals and perennials. Feed the as directed and you will have healthy plants. Am I selling the product, no! However I am a horticulturist and know plants well. At the same time I would not use this on my vegetables because it is a chemical. Again, good for annuals and perennials.
B000OWF7YI I have read and been following all the reviews of this product so far. So far this product is working wonders on my garden, it is one of the ingredients I am using this year for a strong healthy garden. I am using this product for all my vegetables and flowers. I have 14 different varieties of corn, I have 12 different varieties of carrots, I have 94 tomato plants of different varieties, I have broccoli and I have cabbage, peppers sweat and hot, I have cabbage and herbs, peas and beans, watermelon strawberries and canalope, I have onions and a lot of other things and so far everything is growing big and strong. I am using one package a week it comes with eight packages and I mix it with water and keep it in a water sprayer. Do not dump right on plants and do not let the blue sit on the plants in powder form. us as directed will do just fine. I also used cow manuer in the ground before I planted and I make sure to water every day unless it is raining outside. But I do like this product and I do keep pictures and videos from day to day as to compare the different years to see what works and so far this product is working and doing a great job. I have very healthy plants that are bigger then even I expected.
B000OWF7YI This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
B000OWF7YI Miracle-Gro has always been good and I got this because of the price and convenience. All one has to do is put one of the packets the box contains  into the Miracle-Gro Sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder) and one can feed the lilacs and everything else in sight in a relatively short time.
B000OWF7YI I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIZER.As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder (used with the granular fertilizer), the feeder it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.OTHER CONCERNS> Sometimes you get a bright blue stream, and a few seconds later, a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer).> A different situation is when a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue.  What happens is that the blue pigment is more soluble than other components of the fertilizer, but the blue pigment itself is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.  As long as there is at least a teaspoon of undissolved fertilizer in the container, the feeder is still probably delivering full-strength fertilizer solution.TIPS ON USE:Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it \"used up\".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.FEEDING SCHEDULEA good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.FOLIAR FEEDINGPart of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMSDespite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.
B000OWF97S have a couple different seeds planted already. One has already popped up. Not sure if that's due to the dirt, but i'm happy.
B000OWF97S This seed starting potting soil is great for seeds and for rooting cuttings.  It is light and airy and roots can develop nicely.  Plant seedlings need air to grow properly.  It is clean, sterile and without fungus.  Fungus can cause damping off disease which usually kills the plant.  I would recommend this mix.
B000OWF97S If you like using Jiffy-Mix seed starting mix, comparison shop.  Even your local home center probably has it available cheaper.
B000OWF97S The price is great but found this easy to use and my plants doing great. So glad I got it.
B000OWF97S I keep herbs in my kitchen year round and this soil works very well for me. I start seeds in the little Jiffy wafers and set them in a larger container of the starting mix. I use grow lights because I don't have good light in my kitchen. This winter I am adding some wonderful pepper plants I am starting now.I'll trasfer them to 4 inch pots, keep them under the lights until Spring and set out the plants, along with tomatoes I'll start later. It is very nice and easy to work with this soil. It is light and holds moisture very well. I have good luck with it.
B000P0DK1Q BROKE
B000P0DK1Q I just used it again this afternoon. It is simple, durable, and does the job remarkably well when used with the ready-made packets in Scotts Company Miracle Gro All Purpose Plant Food and Miracle-Gro 1001832 Lawn Food Box, 5-Pound container. I just noticed Miracle-Gro is part of the Scotts company which explains much. Also, the price is right--I'd actually pay a little more for the sprayer and food.
B000P0DK1Q This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the \"rip-off\" index of these products. My \"other half\" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and \"mist off\" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )
B000P0FHQ2 STARTED GROWING CLOVER?
B000P0FHQ2 If you get this and the sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder, Ready-to-Use Solution, 1-Pound) you can do your whole lawn in just a few minutes with excellent results. This container has 4 packets. You open the durable, extremely simple and easy-to-use sprayer, put in one packet, and spray. No ratios, no guesswork, no nothing but pleasant results. I believe I love the darn things.... The lawn does, anyway.
B000P0FHQ2 My front yard has only a couple inches of top soil covering crappy clay. It literally died last year in a horrible heat wave and drought, and did not come back this Spring. I dethatched and replanted it. After the new grass germinated and was a few weeks old, I applied this lawn food generously with a sprayer.One month later, I have a thick, beautiful, dark green lawn. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that the grass LOVED this product. I'll have to wait and see how long it stays happy, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.
B000P0FHQ2 This product seems to be very effective in &#34;greening up&#34; the lawn, and it is certainly easy to apply.  HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.  I also re-glued the one I had disassembled, and now IT works well, also.
B000P1TB9K I think this Aspects 182 Super Dome Humbrella for Bird feeders by Aspects is about double the price I would have liked to pay, but this Humbrella Dome for Bird Feeder is just what I need to keep the squirrels out of my feeder. The price of feed saved will pay for it over one season and I won't have to cringe when I look out and see one of the little fuzzy tails hanging upside down from my feeder. Works well and is a sound product which offers: Classic styling for easy cleaning and refilling: Strong polycarbonate construction is leak proof and drip resistant and has a Bee Resistant design and built-in ant moat.
B000P1TB9K I bought this to add to my squirrel proof feeder (other review). Wish I had bought it from day 1 because the squirrels had already chewed parts of that feeder, and this prevents squirrels from sliding onto ANY feeder....they slip right off.....clear plastic has not discolored and does its job. Birds linger on the feeder when it's raining since they keep dry....
B000P1TB9K Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
B000P1TB9K A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder.  It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away, and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry.  There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels.  The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs.  But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper.  If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety, they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are.  You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced.  The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website.  They sell a full 15\" gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $8.00.  (At the time of this writing.  It my be a little more now, but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects).  They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system.  And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs. They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders.  The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear.  Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway.  From that time on they are never clear again.  If you're in the market for a baffle, especially for more than one, forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company.  You will be most pleased I believe... : )
B000P1TB9K Very well made, not \"cheap, thin, brittle plastic\".  Quite attractive, actually....but most importantly, keeps those annoying tree rats (squirrels) out of my bird feeders.
B000P1TB9K This is one of my favorite domes because it is 18 inches in diameter. (Wide domes offer more protection.) The polycarbonate is thick and the hangers are heavy duty. It's durable. My only complaint is that the top screw hook is too long. Feeders need to be high enough off the ground so that feeding birds are safe from cats.This particular dome works best on feeders that have a ring or very short hook on top. A ring or  short hook allows the dome to almost rest on top of the feeder, and that's the way it protects the birds and seeds. In the photo displayed in this listing, the feeder has a tall bail for hanging. The dome hooks on the bail. But see how this makes the dome sit WAY above the feeder? That's not good because it exposes both the birds and seed ports to rain and snow. This style feeder needs the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II or any dome that has a slit across the top that is wide enough to go over a bail in a way that the dome rests directly on top o the feeder. Look at the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II and you'll see what I mean. Whatever you buy, make sure that the opening at the top of the dome will fit the hook, eye or bail on your feeder.
B000P1TB9K We have lots of squirrels and I have fought many the battle to save my feeders.  Purchased this as my last attempt before just giving in and giving up on feeders.  This is a miracle!  They all have tried to get to several different styles of feeders under this dome and NONE have made it.  They have given up and now my feeder is safe and full for the birds.  Birds were a bit confused at first since it is quite large, but only took a few days and now they're loving it as well.
B000P1TB9K I live in Florida, a state that experiences almost daily monsoon like weather every day during the summer, with horizontal rain being common at least a few times a week. I purchased my first as a rain guard to keep my feeder dry.The reason it looks silly is because I have various Brome Bird Feeders which are quite long (12 to 18&#34;) and while the dome is super wide, it doesn't look like it will do anything. Then the rain will begin, my Florida wide gutters straining to handle the rain, but the dome &#34;appears&#34; to be blocking the rain. Immediately after the rain stop, I stick my fingers into each port to test the dampness of the seeds. To my surprise, they were fully dry. I tested this on one of our rainiest summers. Note - I do take my bird feeders down during severe hurricanes, but it did handle a record breaking 22&#34; of water in a 24 hour time period.When I purchased future bird feeder, I ordered an additional super dome. Combing the cost of this pricey dome plus a good feeder (Brome in my case), it can really hurt one's pocket book,  but it is hard to argue with success - on an almost daily basis I see feeding: 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 4 cardinals, 40 golden finches, 2 bluejays, and the random mocking bird or robin.
B000P71GLU I have just about worn out the auger that I purchased here.  I started out planting bulbs.  Then found it was an easy was to collect soil samples several inched deep in untilled soil, was good to drill holes for installing deep tree watering ports and turning my compost pile.  It has worked for me in loose/loamy soil, southern red clay and rocky southern red clay.  It has done the job in all (using an 18 v drill).Advice:  If drilling into moist clay soil, it tends to drill straight down like a screw.  I have to hold it back to auger the damp clay out of the hole.After hundreds of holes, the lower half has worn to a cone but still works well.
B000P7345G This is the best fertilizer to supplement your container grown tomatoes.  Dissolve in water and feed every 7-14 days.  Special formula designed for tomatoes.  Contains Magnesium which helps prevent blossum end rot in tomatoes.
B000P7345G I have used Miracle Grow all year and my yields for all veggies and tomatoes are very high and the growth of my tomatoes is unbelievalbly big.
B000P7345G Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas.
B000P7345G I used this on my tomato plants and they seem to respond well to this treatment. You have to use it every week, but it doesn't take much and with last me this season.
B000P9URDQ A feature of this trap is \"never have to touch a dead mouse!\"  I find that pretty pathetic, because if you can't go through the trouble of putting on a pair of gloves then... I won't go into that.  Yes this trap catches mice, but it also catches and kills chipmunks and other rodents that do not create problems for humans.  The trap uses a conventional spring set arm that crushes the animal quickly and is therefore more humane than other traps. The problem with this mechanism is that it can crush the animal into a mess.  Maybe some people would get a kick out of that, but I don't. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores).  Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures.  It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B000P9URDQ I've caught many mice with this trap. This is just the traditional trap with a cover so you don't have to see the dead body, just the tail. What else can I say? I've caught at least a dozen mice with this. Very occasionally the mouse will clean up the peanut butter without setting off the trap but I just bait it again. About 3 times, the mouse turned around and set it off facing out. I have no idea why a mouse would back into it, but the trap killed it all the same. The entry hole is pretty big so that it can catch some pretty big mice.
B000P9URDQ Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me.
B000PBXESO We found the hummingbird feed very easy to set up. We mix our own sugar water and have lots of hummingbird visitors. We have enjoyed watching them as they use the feeder.
B000PBXESO With this feeder hanging outside my office window, I see hummers feeding on it all day long. It's easy to fill and hang, easy to take apart and clean, and the hummers can't get enough.Living in the southwest desert, the hummers around here have a particularly hard time finding fresh nectar sources throughout the year. It gets so hot here in the summer that the nectar in hummingbird feeders either ferments or completely dries up within 5-7 days. The feeders here need to be cleaned and filled with fresh nectar twice a week.With this feeder it's easy and painless to take down, clean and refill.The hanging hardware works well, everything seems to be fairly durable.I'm planning on ordering a second one soon, I could not be happier with the one I have.
B000PBXESO This is the best Hummingbird feeder I have ever purchased. I can actually fill it enough to leave it hanging for two weeks, even though I have more and more hummingbirds attending. The bottom has a built-in perch all the way around so the little guys can actually rest while they are drinking. What a concept! Very easy to fill and clean.
B000PBXESO I've got beautiful blown glass and antique glass bottle feeders I just adore, but none of them hold nearly as much nectar as this beast does.  Come the end of April, my swarm of hummers is back and hungry - I keep them all out and need to refill 5 feeders at least once per week.If your garden is heavily trafficked by humming birds, this feeder is great.  If not, the nectar may turn to vinegar before they finish it, so a smaller size or lower fill level might be better.  I never color the nectar (the red colorant chemicals can cause the laid eggs to be thinly shelled and easily broken).  The birds find the feeder by the bright red plastic dispensing bottom without complaint; no need to color the sugar-water.
B000PBXESO I bought 2 hummingbird feeders at the same time since the little cuties can be so aggressive. I bought 2 different brands. This one was my favorite at first as I liked the way it looked. However, its not going to hold up. The metal ring at the top is not attached in any way and the nectar bottle will fall through from time to time even though I don't even fill it half way. This has caused the plastic \"bowl\" at the bottom to break. This red plastic nectar holder is actually in 2 parts. One of the two pieces has broken slightly from all the falls to the ground. It is holding up for now...but will probably need to get tossed at the end of this season.If you're curious, the other feeder I purchased was this one: It is holding up much better...B00004RA8P
B000PBXESO This feeder isn't all designery like those made by Perky Pet, but hummingbirds seem to like it better, it cleans up reasonably well, and none of the materials are toxic to birds (no copper or zinc galvanization as seen on many other products).  There's no paint to peel off like has happened with the other brand, and the red color is what seems to attract hummers most reliably.
B000PBZFJK I have 3 feeders hanging on my deck - this is the &#34;go to&#34; one.  I don't know why, but I guess &#34;pretty&#34; has nothing to do with their choice!  Easy to clean, assemble.  No drips or spills.
B000PBZFJK Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
B000PBZFJK I bought the one with the small bottle and refresh it twice a week, The birds love it. The ants love it too but it is a death trap for them. They tell me ants are high in protein?
B000PBZFJK This was my first hummingbird feeder that I have ever purchased.  Arrived as described, though it is smaller that I thought it would be.  Have already made food and have it hanging, just waiting for the birds!
B000PGOON8 Given the cost of this unit, the water reservoir capacity, and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots, I think I'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I'm going to be out of town for a week or more.
B000PGOON8 The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present.  Could not get it to deliver water to the planter.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a \"sensor\") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the \"sensor\" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12\" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week.
B000PSFLT2 This is great to use in the garden I currently have two hoses attached to it and this helps me to get all over my property, we have 4 acres. I se it daily and have not had any problems.
B000Q5S7RM It's not every day that a bag full of lively worms land on your doorstep. Several generations of these worms have feasted on our compost pile ever since, leaving everyone happy.
B000Q5S7RM Healthy, live, wiggly worms. Put them in my compost bin and hopefully they will do the job. If they migrate out to the rest of the yard thats fine. I will be back for more.
B000Q5S7RM Ordered in March going to Fl. And they arrived quickly and all alive. The worms are happy and thriving in my compost bed. They are already improving the crappy dense non draining pile of fill that I have been putting my household compost in. I noticed the hump in the middle is going down faster and it's getting more like soil rather then muck fill. Still has a long way to go before I can plant but the worms are definitely improving the quality and airation. Gotta have worms and this company was a good choice to get them from!
B000QD7MZ2 This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
B000QD7MZ2 PROS- large size, individual perches, easy to hang bailCONS- all plastic, including the nectar bottleThe main advantage of this model is its large size, so if you have lots of hummer activity, you won't run out as fast.  Also, being plastic, it doesn't weigh as much as those with glass bottles, though of course once you fill it with a larger amount of nectar it weighs more.However, I do wonder if some of the plastic from the bottle is getting into the nectar.  We try to avoid plastic packaging in our house, what is this plastic doing to the hummers.  Also, I wonder if the clear plastic bottle will discolor or scuff from cleaning over time, in a way that glass wouldn't.The bail (hanging loop) is larger and easier to manipulate than on other hummingbird feeders I have, but it still gets in the way of standing the bottle up straight when filling it.  If they had made it just a bit larger, or designed the plastic bottle to have some recesses in it for the bail, then the bottle could stand up straight when needed.
B000QD7MZ2 I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me.
B000QD7MZ2 I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000QD7MZ2 Early May is the start of humming bird season around our house so the arrival of the Perky-Pet feeder was very timely. Like clockwork, the little critters came looking for food and my wife was able to put the feeder in the garden in time to satisfy a small flock of these fascinating creatures.The feeder holds a lot nectar and that's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing, when there are a lot of birds feeding, you don't have to refill as often. The curse, the base doesn't come apart and because of its internal corners and seams, it's hard to clean.The tube is easy to clean but the base is somewhat inaccessible making it hard to get spotless - important because around here, mold forms quickly.The small perches are used by the birds, giving us a good long look as they feed.Overall, a good product and recommended if you are a careful and dedicated cleaner. Else, keep shopping.
B000QD7MZ2 Who can resist the tiny delicate hummingbird?  I love seeing them in gardens at flowers such as coral bells, honeysuckle, columbine, delphinium, trumpet vine and other plants that tend to have a bell like blossom.  This feeder when filled with a syrupy liquid will attract the lovely creatures too but it is a bit of a pain to put together and if the user is not very careful spills and leaks are a fact of life.  Holding forty-eight ounces this is the &#34;grand master&#34; of hummingbird feeders but I still prefer the old fashioned method of feeding them with flowers thus receiving the additional benefit of more beauty and color in my yard.
B000QD7MZ2 While it's attractive, it's way too large. I prefer having (several) smaller feeders. Party because hummers are territorial they like having &#34;their own&#34; feeder to go to. And a feeder with 48 oz. of nectar is going to take a long time for the birds to empty. Probably one will never fill it  more than 1/4 full. Nectar liquid goes bad in a few days, especially in hot temperatures.  All the red color on the unit itself is bound to attract, but I prefer glass feeders these days, they hold up better in the hot sun and with time.
B000QD7MZ2 There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B000QD7MZ2 While this is one of the larger hummiingbird feeders, it lacks in quality. First, it's all plastic, unlike their other product, the 209B. It also came with the drinknig stations unassembled (though the other model comes assembled). There were also twice as many pieces sent - is this a mistake or intentionally wasteful? So while this feeder is functional, it just isn't nice as a glass one.Please toss away the included food. It contains dyes that can be toxic to birds. It's unconscionable  that Perky-pet is including this nasty stuff with their feeders. Just mix 4 parts water to 1 part sugar and you'll be good to go.
B000QD7MZ2 This feeder is great.  It is easy to clean.  No more sticking something down inside it try to clean stuff out.  The base does not come apart but there is plenty of room for a dish brush or cloth to get in there and clean.  I was slightly disappointed that the nectar holding part is plastic.  For some reason I thought it would be glass.  We will see how it holds up in the weather but so far so good.
B000QD7MZ2 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird FeederCategory: Accessories...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder for a couple of weeks:  In the box, one finds 1 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, 6 red flower-shaped medallions, 6 yellow (coin sized) inserts with feeding holes for flower-shaped medallions, 6 perches and 3 metal screws -- all in individual (clear) packets.Note, the feeder is not fully assembled (and Mine didn't come with instructions). so, just grab a pair of gardening gloves and press one of the (included) red plastic flower-shaped medallions into each of the 6 holes on the base of the unit -- *snap* -- . Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic. Cleaning the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, for the first time, was quick and easy. A normal sized bottle brush did the job.The nectar reservoir is crystal clear, making it easy to see the nectar level from a distance. The opening is large, making for easy filling or cleaning.  The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap. The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master Hummingbird Feeder has a 48 ounce nectar capacity --  that's 6 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar. This will make the feeder a bit heavy, so one will need to select a sturdy hook, or tree branch, to hang it from. The large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio. There is no ant trap/moat on this Feeder....Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ..  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014
B000QD7MZ2 As a brand I like Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders the best this one I have some doubts. It comes in a box and you need to assemble it no instructions included but it is obvious how to do it. My fear was you have to press so hard on the plastic red flowers to snap into the base it would crack, same with the yellow rings. It did go together without cracking. The top that holds the bottle seems to come off too easy I fear if the feeder if full it may fall to the ground. The one thing that really disappointed me is the built in metal hanger is just a tad to long to slide over the shepherds hook without spilling some of the sugar water out onto the ground.Last Summer I read that the red dye is hard on the kidneys of the hummingbirds so I make my own sugar water and they drink it down faster than I can make it. I hope this year adding 2 large feeders it can be a once a week fill and clean. It is early here yet the scout hummers are out as one came to my window 3 times last week where last year I had a window feeder that broke. I do have this one out now but I didn't fill it I do want to make sure my regulars know they can count on food again this year.If the unit does fail I will come back and update my review.
B000QD7MZ2 We have another Hummingbird feeder with small perches, and we've found that Hummingbirdsdo use the perches, and in doing so allows us to watch them longer.This large and roomy Hummingbird feeder is 25\" around the base (7 3/4\" dia) which allows ample roomfor the birds to share six feeding ports, which is nice since Humming birds are rather territorial.It's well made, and the plastic of the six perches are flexible, durable, and are a nice large size (1 1/2\" wide)The feeder doesn't come with instructions how to put it together, however, it's obvious how it belongs.Except for the yellow buttons which took a second glance to understand they snap in rounded side up.The 6 buttons and 6 flowers are quite firm to snap together, but the flowers easily pull out to clean.And the yellow centers punch out easily with a slotted screwdriver.A very nice 48 oz feede
B000QD7MZ2 The hummingbirds and orioles love this feeder.  There is a place for their cute, little feet.  So do I love it.  It is easy to take apart and clean.  I use little brushes.  It holds a lot of liquid so I do not have to fill constantly.  I have a number of feeders going at the same time and have at least 50 hummingbirds humming around all day long in the summer.  I hang these feeders in the shade of a tree.  Would definitely recommend.
B000QD7MZ2 When in a hour of hanging this feeder the hummers found it! It was very easy to put together. It's super easy to refill and to clean. I love the perches under each flower. The birds seem to enjoy them as well. They come and rest on them often. We love watching these amazing creatures and this feeder helps us to do so. Great product!
B000QD7MZ2 I bought this for my parents who live on a farm where they literally get swarms of hummingbirds.  My father has to refill the nectar every day because there are so many birds lighting on his little feeder.  With this new 48 ounce feeder, now he only has to refill the nectar every two or three days.  I would not recommend this feeder if you only have a few visitors because the nectar will spoil and ferment before they can consume it all and this is very unhealthy for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 This is ideal feeder. Easy to fill and easy to hang up. That is what I liked, the easy of filling and hanging. The ease allows me to let my daughter to help me. She really enjoys feeding and watching the humming birds.
B000QD7MZ2 We love hummingbirds and always put out a feeder or two every year despite the fact that in our x-burban wooded area we don't get that many.  (We still try ;)The feeders I currently have on hand are all PERKY-PET.  I know there are other varieties out there but Perky-pet provides different styles, all at affordable prices.  Right now I have this one (which is the 220), thePerky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder, and our old standby, thePerky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird FeederOut of those three, this is the one I would have rated the lowest, except I have to say that the Hummingbirds really like it.  What I worried about was the base. Since it doesn't come apart I'm going to have to clean it with Q-tips.  This would be a real negative, except for the fact that their Hummers like this feeder.  It has convenient little perches which are set perfectly for feeding.  The birds sit up high enough so that all they need to do is bend over a bit and drink from the plastic flowers.THE GOOD--I prefer glass, but sometimes if children are involved, shatter-proof plastic is better.--Nice handle.--Attractive design.--Hummingbirds love it. We are just getting our first Hummers as I write this and I have to say that they like sitting on the little perches and drinking.THE BAD--Looks like it's going to be difficult to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS--I read all the reviews about leaking. Mine didn't leak. I don't know if Perky-Pet improved the design, but we shook the container, and so far, no leaks.--Unlike the other models I mentioned this one doesn't have threaded glass. Instead it has a 'bayonet' connection.--This thing is HUGE. Unless you live in a locale where you get tons of hummer traffic, I wouldn't suggest you fill this feeder with more than a cup of hummer-chow. The reason is that once it starts getting warm the sugars can get all gross and you should change them out frequently.--Since this feeder is plastic, it might make a good choice if you are going to be letting younger children work with it.SUGGESTIONS--It's best if you don't use the red food. Making your own is super easy, nothing more than mixing 1/4 cup sugar with 1 cup of distilled water. Red dye not needed.--Ants! We hang our feeders off the deck from iron hangers. We keep ants away with vaseline. I have the kids coat the the riser on the road with a heavy slather of vaseline and the ants stay away. Doesn't harm ants or other wildlife.
B000QD7MZ2 I didn't realize when ordering this hummingbird feeder that the container itself was plastic. We have other Perky Pet hummingbird feeders but he jars are made of glass. The plastic is more difficult to lock into place with the plastic bottom so that it won't leak. It's a nice big feeder, holding 48 ounces of feeding solution. It is surprising how fast tiny hummingbirds go through the food but since it needs to be cleaned every two or three days in order for mold not to grow, we will probably fill it only halfway unless we get more Hummers.The feeder came unassembled, but it was pretty easy to snap the yellow flowers to the openings and screw the little perches to the bottom. The container is easy to clean but the bottom part requires a brush since it's difficult to remove the yellow flower covers and they will probably not last if we have to take them on and off all the time. It's a little bit difficult to secure the container to the bottom, having to twist it into the slots and secure it so that it doesn't leak. I am hoping it will last long-term. We use this type of ant barrier or \"ant moat\" that hangs between the hook and the feeder.Songbird Essentials SE620 Nectar Protector Bird Accessory. It works very well and keeps the feeder from being overrun with ants.
B000QD7MZ2 There isn't a whole lot to say about this, it's a hummingbird feeder. The feeding ports and perches all come in separate bags and you just snap them on. There aren't any instructions or anything but it's easy enough to figure out if you just look at the picture on the box to see what it should look like. The only real downside to this feeder is that it is so big that it's really impractical unless you've got tons of hummingbirds in your yard. When you consider that nectar is supposed to be switched out at least once a week if not more often, 48 ounces is an enormous amount to keep switching out. I would suggest going for something smaller unless you really think you're going to make it through this much nectar before it spoils.
B000QD7MZ2 I like the large capacity, and the hummers liked it right away. I guess I've gotten spoiled, but I miss a bee guard and ant moat. I made my own ant moat. A hanging wire would be nice. But I really appreciate the wide filler. Assembly was a little tough with my arthritic thumbs, but I got it done. The most important thing is that my tiny hummingbirds like it.
B000QD7MZ2 I have used a lot of Perky-Pet feeders over the past 20+ years. This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they'd done better on the materials end.
B000QD7MZ2 The best thing about this feeder is its huge 48 ounce capacity. If you're looking for something you can fill up and then forget about for a long time, this may be it. Otherwise, it's all plastic and looks cheap. I'd invest in a smaller glass/metal feeder instead.
B000QD7MZ2 I've had a few of the Perky Pet feeders over the years, a few of the plastic, a few of the glass - and they all have their pro's and con's.  Aesthetically, I still prefer thePerky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feederseries, but the birds in my area don't seem too attracted to the color (although Perky Pet does offer blue and red versions which might do a better job). The glass bottles just seem to have a little bit of visual impact that allow it to act sort of as a decoration and not just a feeder. These giant 48oz feeders don't try and hide their function - they very boldly proclaim that they are hummingbird feeders.The feeder doesn't really include any useful assembly instructions, but that's not too big a deal as putting it together is pretty elementary. The large reservoir is easy to clean, but you do need a brush (or a really small hand) to get to the very bottom. The perches are very finicky and feel delicate - I'm not really sure how long they'll last. The plastic is also a big question mark. I live in sun country in the middle of Texas, and the harsh sun likes to take out its aggression on plastic. Previous plastic feeders have often cracked or discolored within just a couple of seasons.Another thing to keep in mind, although the large size is nice, unless you're feeding a giant swarm of birds, the nectar will probably \"go bad\" before the birds get to drink it all. In my hot climate, the sugar water molds up within a couple of days or less.All-in-all, I think my next feeder will probably be another glass + metal, but the brilliant red coloration and significant nectar size do make this particular feeder stand out. As long as the plastic parts make an attempt at lasting more than a single season, I'll be pretty ha
B000QD7MZ2 I was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings.  The more  openings and parts the more chance for failure.The &#34;flowers&#34;  have to be pushed into holes and then the yellow centers inserted.  The hole you push the flower into is failrly big and  over time the plastic becomes brittle and leakage begins. My hummers seem to like the smaller feeders  ( which are made by Perky Pet)  I think a little more &#34;design tweaking&#34;  is needed. The smaller feeders are simpler but work better.
B000QD7MZ2 This is a huge capacity plastic feeder that does the job well and attracts hummingbirds quickly.  Where we are, we get mostly Broad-tail hummingbirds.  They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren't used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \"nectar,\" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don't want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn't spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn't leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don't seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.
B000QD7MZ2 We got this setup and hung up in the yard and are now just waiting to see some humming birds.  It took a bit to get warmer in New England this year so hopefully soon.
B000QTMT7W This wedge ssplits through the toughest wood like a champ! It must be because of the extra angles it attacks the wood with, but it makes splitting EASY!
B000QTMT7W Having had a large oak taken down and left with a large pile of 17 - 20\" pieces to chop, I figured a new splitting wedge would make life easier. My old wedge is of similar shape and design but with a blunter tip. For me the new wedge works no better than the old one. Not to say it doesn't work, but that I didn't need to buy a new one.This new wedge is more prone to pop out of the log than the older one and takes quite a bit of effort to drive into the wood with my maul. On one log section, I eventually gave up and attacked the piece with my new Fiskars X27 axe by slicing around the perimeter. As the diameter of the log shrunk, I was able to finally drive in the wedge and crack the remainder of the wood section in half.I have found that putting the wedge in the center of a log section, even one with a crack, doesn't work as well as off-centering the wedge. On less challenging sections of wood, I was able to drive the splitter much more easily and often separate the wood into three pieces.And so this wedge  works fairly well within limits; it's just not the heroic, wonder tool I was hoping for.UPDATE - After more use and experimentation I've found that my much older Oregon splitter is easier to drive, doesn't fly out at me, and works faster. This new splitter has quickly been relegated to reserve status.
B000QTMT7W I have not had a chance to use this product yet. I bought a big Fiskars wood splitting axe and the axe works so well I have not needed a wedge. This wedge seemed well priced and it arrived quickly. Looks good in my shed. If someone steals my Fiskars I might need this wedge in the future.
B000R0WXI0 We live out in the country where weeds and thorny vines really flourish, so I still use either the Roundup Super Concentrate (purple top) or the Tough Brush Killer (yellow top) for much of our more stubborn vegetation such as blackberry vines, multifloral rose, poison ivy, and saplings.  It just seems to do a better job of getting rid of the difficult stuff.But for sidewalks, flagstone patios and walkways, and driveways, this Roundup Extended Control can't be beat.  When I use the purple or yellow topped Roundup on these areas, I end up having to respray every 3-5 weeks to combat all of the new weeds.  With the Extended Control, I can usually go 2-3 months before spraying again.  The bottle claims that it lasts up to 4 months, but in my experience, it generally wears off before then.  Still, it makes a big difference.  Instead of the 5-6 times that I would normally need to spray these areas during a growing season, I can usually get by with only spraying a couple times a year.Roundup products do take considerably longer to start producing noticeable die-back of weeds.  Many weed killers, such asSpectracide Weed And Grass Killer, wilt the weeds within an hour and leave noticeably dead weed \"leaves\" within 24 hours but have little luck in killing the root.  With the Roundup, I rarely notice any effect at all on the weeds until at least a few days later.  Even then, it's sometimes up to 2 weeks or more before they are fully dead.But, there is a reason for this.  Spectracide uses a an active ingredient called \"diquat\" which kills only the part of the plant that the spray physically touches...in effect, just drying it out so that the leaves and stem die quickly.  Therefore, it doesn't tend to kill the roots and so the weed continues to put forth new growth from the ground.Roundup, on the other hand, uses an active ingredient called \"phosphoenolpyruvate\" which works to destroy the entire \"metabolism\" of a weed and kills the entire plant...including the roots.  For these reasons, I much prefer the Roundup products.  Even though the results are not immediately noticeable, the longer term outcome is much better.Like with the other Roundup products, I mix it up with water in a pump pressure sprayer.  It is supposed to be safe from rain wash-off in 30 minutes.NOTE:  While I use Roundup as my primary weed killer throughout the growing season, I do find it beneficial to keep a container ofSpectracide Weed And Grass Killeron hand.  In late autumn, Roundup isn't usually as effective since it works on the weeds' metabolism...and the weeds are nearly dormant in cooler weather.  In this instance, the \"dry up\" process of the Spectracide works the best in my opinion.
B000R0WXI0 Used this to kill weeds and grass which were growing between the stones on my patio. In two days, they had turned yellow. It is &#34;extended control&#34; killer- will update if it has to be re-sprayed. So far, am well pleased with the product, and can recommend.
B000R0WXI0 I gave up buying anything else. I have a pervasive weed and Bermuda grass problem twice every year, southwest desert area.  Other sprays have to be reapplied too often and have actually killed shrubs and harmed trees.  Not this one! It lasts through to the next spraying time! Do it once and forget bout it!  It is very important to apply it in the sun or warmer part of day, but too much sun or heat (in excess of 110 degrees) seem to counteract the effect.  Every year I seem to have less to spray, too!  So maybe in a few years.........
B000RNENU8 Miracle-Gro 1001501 All Purpose Liquid Plant Food Jug, 32-Ounce.  I better like it as I ordered 3 of these.  Have put some on a few plants but have not seen and change yet.
B000RNENU8 I've tried several different plant foods over a period of four decades with my vegetable garden. From everything I can tell, Miracle-Gro is the best in boosting the growth of one's plants. Other brands I've tried have produced less consistently good results. I generally add at the time of planting and follow the directions on the bottle. I would definitely recommend this product for any vegetable or flower garden.
B000RNENU8 I've used this product for years and it works great on all plants and flowers. I highly recommend for anyone.
B000RUM0R4 We installed the Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage around existing growing plants.  The pictorial instructions were easy to follow.  Spacing and snapping in the clips to the three (03) stakes was a \"snap\".  Since the vine tomato plant was in full growth, we removed the existing single bamboo stakes and ties and pushed the three cage stakes into the soil prior to snapping the arms in place.  What an improvement over the flimsy stakes we originally used.  The unit comes with nine (09) adjustable support clips attached to the steel core stakes with heavy plastic coating. The unit can be used again and again - a quality cage at a reasonable cost. Recommended.The box contains:*Three 5' heavy-duty Sturdy Stakes*Nine fully-adjustable support clips and instructions.
B000RUM0R4 This is a handy cage, lightweight and easy to set up and move around.  In my case, though, I think it will be better suited to being a pepper support than a tomato support.  I grow indeterminate tomatoes inEarthBoxes, and they get very tall and very bushy.  This cage worked well while they were smaller, but before long it did not support their weight or height well.  I had to lash it to the deck railing.  There also weren't enough cross braces to tie all of the bushy branches to the cage.  However, the EarthBox also does a phenomenal job with peppers, and I think it will work well with those.
B000RUM0R4 For those gardeners who like to plant vine veggies this is perfect.  I like to grow grape tomatoes and they like to grow upwards to 8 feet high.  In order to keep a grape tomato plant growing upward instead of spreading outwards towards the ground is to tie it as it grows to a trellis or pole.  Doing this enables the plant to flower and make grape tomatoes spaced out and away from pests on the ground.  With the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage you have three separate planes for the grape tomato to grow, which provides more air to the vine and space for tomatoes to grow.  My plants are just starters at this point but I have grown grape tomatoes for years.  I found in the past fastening the vine on a 2 dimensional plane was cumbersome and unnatural for the plant.  I'm looking forward to now having a 3 dimensional cage to allow the plant to stretch out.I plan on updating this post with possibly a video in a few months.  Happy gardening!
B000RUM0R4 We've used the small round tomato cages that cost a couple of bucks for a few years now.  This cage is a huge improvement!  First of all it's significantly taller, our soil is muddy so I don't see our plants overgrowing this cage.  It is also sturdier than the round cages we've used.  I like the adjustability of it.  Our plants haven't come up yet for this season, but I have high hopes for this quality cage.
B000RUM0R4 I was delighted with this arrived- it is perfect. Far sturdier than any other tomato cage I have used, and versatile. I grow a wide range of indeterminate heirlooms, and this is perfect. I will be ordering more.
B000RUM0R4 This review is for the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage. The cage is sturdy and provides good support, up to 4.25 feet above ground. Rating 4.5 stars.The cage is made of hard plastic.  Each stake is 5 feet (60\") in height, and 1/4\" thick. One end is slightly pointed and that end gets buried 8\" to 10\" into the ground, leaving slightly more than 4 feet above ground.  The connecting arms are 12\" long, 1/4\" thickness at the center, and 1/8\" thickness at the ends.  The circular ends of the arms snap onto the stakes. The stakes are ridged/textured so the arms don't slide up and down with weight from the plants.  The arms do glide up/down on the arms with a little bit of force in case you need to reposition them.  The stakes are sturdy and barely bend. They seem tough and durable, and are not flimsy.  The arms do bend slightly more than the stakes, but they aren't flimsy either. I would have prefered if the arms were a little bit stronger/thicker to provider stronger support.
B000RUM0R4 The concept is not a bad one, but in reality, the stakes are too short and too small (in diameter).  I use similar stakes in my garden for tomato plants, but I use 6 foot stakes (and they are not long enough) and the diameter is larger - and still they bend and sometimes crimp and get ruined.  This device does have a nice concept in the cross pieces, but I would hardly call this the \"Ultimate Anything\".  I think it will fulfill a need that I have for pole bean plants, but I will not be using it for tomatoes.
B000RUM0R4 I'm currently using this to grow cucumbers in a large pot.  This was super easy to put together, and has weathered a few good midwestern storms without incident. It is really ideal for what I am using it for.  I'll update if it has any trouble supporting the weight of the cukes as the summer progresses.  If things stay as is, I won't have any complaints!
B000RUM0R4 Honestly, I love it, and now I regret the time, expense and damage to my poor tomato plants caused by regular metal tomato cages. This apparatus is just like an old-fashioned Tinker-Toy, with sturdy vertical upright poles and horizontal connectors which snap on to them so that the tomato support structure can be arranged, extended and linked to any possible configuration. The best is that it can be installed around established plants, and horizontal supports added as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 We usually make our own homemade tomato cages with cattle fence, which is very difficult to bend. We also found that it is hard to reach through the holes in the cattle fence to pick the large tomatoes, and even some of the small cherry tomatoes that grow inside. This is a much better design than our do it yourself attempt! The Blue Ribbon Ultomato cage holds the plant up, but also has a wide opening so the ripe tomatoes are very easy to reach. If you do need to secure a section a little more it is easy to tie a section to the middle or upper stand (I use garbage bag twist ties). This is a great design and I will soon be replacing all of our homemade cattle fence stands with the Ultomato cages.
B000RUM0R4 The reason I got this product was to get my cucumbers up off the ground, as they tend to take over a lot of territory otherwise.  (See my note below on how I stake my tomatoes.)As stated in some of the other reviews, I agree that the five-foot stakes that come with this product are pretty short, but I love how this design works. The product is designed so that you can place the cross supports anywhere you want.  They don't have to be three in one location as shown in the picture.  If you need to move one cross-support up or down to accommodate a heavier, fruit-bearing branch, just do it.By the way, if you think that that 5-foot stakes will be too short, the stakes that come with this are the same standard green metal rods covered in green plastic that you can buy at any garden center.  So -- if you want more than 4 feet of stake showing above the ground, you can get longer green stakes at a garden center and use the three 5-foot stakes that come with this unit somewhere else.  The cross-supports will clip on the longer stakes in exactly the same way and you'll still be able to adjust them as needed.The bottom line is I love the simplistically clever design.  If you cage tomatoes, these are a good alternative to regular wire cages.  I just wouldn't use them with any plant that gets TOO heavy or has to withstand high winds.  As for my own personal use, this product will work just fine for my cucumbers.**RE: Tomatoes -- After many years of trial and error, I now stake my tomatoes using a single 2x2x8 pounded one-foot deep about 5 or 6 inches from the plant, then pinch off all suckers, tying up the main vine along the stake as the vine grows.  Using the single stake method is, by far, the best I've found for better production on tomato plants.  I also get more plants in less garden space, and it's easier to work around them, too. Cages were always a pain -- falling over with heavy growth, bending in high wind, and breaking.  I learned the single-stake method from a tomato grower who moved here from Romania, and after a bit of online research I learned that commercial tomato growers use similar methods in greenhouses, hanging strings from the greenhouse ceiling.  Because I don't have huge greenhouse, I tried the 2x2x8 single stake method--with great results.  That said, if I was told I had to use a cage, I would choose the Ultomato cage design over traditional wire cages, as the modular design provides greater flexibility to change/adjust the set-up as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for the past four growing seasons and I won't go back.  In the size the come they are great for your typical determinate tomato.  I find that for the big bushy heirloom indeterminate varieties that I like to grow that I need bigger cages.  No problem, I buy a couple and make the cage fit the variety.  Four poles will do for most, but I find using six really gives me room to let the plant spread out.  That allows the plant to dry better and helps reduce fungus problems.  They cost a bit, but they last.  I use a rubber mallet to drive them in, and only loose a few poles a year (out of about 30).  These are so easy to use that I can't ever see myself going back to the old rigid cages.
B000RUM0R4 My wife and I love the adjustable arms that give a lot of flexibility.  First tomato cage we've seen that can do that.  Easy to assemble and use.
B000RUM0R4 I'm a long-time gardener who has had to give up the ground game and now must plant in 5-gallon bucket planters (SIPs) on a dirtless back patio. I was really hoping this Ultomato tomato cage would be the answer to my prayer for a structure I could set down inside my bucket planters, then remove and store at the end of the season. Oh, so close...but no cigar. The cross-pieces are just a little too long to allow the vertical rods to stand straight in the bucket, which puts unnecessary tension on the snap-on ends if you try to force it to work. I do hope the Ultomato designers will consider shortening the crosspieces slightly in the future, because this would be a fantastic product for my purposes if they would.Now, that said, I'm going to attempt to plant a bucket planter with the Ultomato just standing on the patio on the outside of the bucket, which does work fine, to see how well it supports a tomato plant once it gets large enough to need the supports. A set of crosspieces can be placed right at the top of the bucket so the bucket itself helps hold the Ultomato up until the tomato grows up into it, then those crosspieces could be moved up to the top. It could be that the weight of the 5-gallon SIP (which I make with gravel in the bottom per Pete Sims' design) will be sufficient to keep the planter itself from blowing over; maybe the Ultomato arranged outside and tied to the bucket won't go anywhere, especially when the tomato gets large enough to press down on the structure and keep it stable.If I don't come back here for an update, you can assume it worked well in the latter case and I'm too busy canning tomatoes to update my review! And, if that is the case, I'm sure I'll get more of these. I'd like to try growing some winter squash on one.
B000RUM0R4 I recently installed the Ultomato Cage on my patio tomato plant in a pot and it is working well so far.Pros:* Sturdy* Lightweight* Green color blends with tomato plant* Installs around already-growing tomato plant* Can place cross bars at whatever height is desired - place lower when the plant is smaller and move up as the plant grows* Triangular center cross-section is small enough to support the stem of a plant and also to add twine if additional tying is necessary* Disassembles for compact storage* Bamboo and plastic construction will not rust or corrodeCons:* A little more time consuming to set up compared to the 4-sided fold flat metal tomato cages* Might not be large enough or sturdy enough for large tomato plants with heavy tomatoes (eg, Beefsteak) - time will tell
B000RUM0R4 \"Do your tomato plants overtake the garden?\"  You bet!!!  We have tomato plants growing crazy this year, and have been trying to corral them so the other garden plants can breath and survive.  We have been using the common metal circular 3 ring style that requires daily maintenance to keep the branches under control.  This year, we got the Ultimate Tomato Cage for the one huge tomato plant that was missing a cage and invading surrounding plants.  WHAT A FANTASTIC INVENTION!  It was easy to put together, and to rearrange the arms after sinking the 3 stakes in the ground.  The stakes are plastic coated metal and very sturdy, and the 9 arms are plastic (not sure how long they will last in the hot AZ. sun), but I think more arms can be ordered, and also stakes, for making a bigger square cage.  I think we may be purchasing a few more of these wonderful cages, possibly for training some squash or cucumber branches up, instead of on the ground, but for it's intended purpose, tomatoes....they are the best!!!
B000RUM0R4 While a part of me still wonders if this is significantly better than a tomato cage or even a few well-positioned stakes, I can't deny that it is awesome to have around.  The assembly was easy, and I was amazed at how sturdy it was--I always worried about those flimsy tomato cages flopping over.  No, sir, this one is quite secure and so easy to move around.  This holds a new plant well, but can also be placed around an already existing plant without too much drama.  Good quality and should be appreciated by gardeners.
B000RUM0R4 Update 07/19/2013: Well, the cage has failed. My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage. The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized. One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed. Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants, but so far, so good. These stakes do have some give to them - I've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there. The side support arms are easy to move around, if needed. This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage, unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season. So far, no complaints!
B000RUM0R4 I was very disappointed in this purchase.  It's my fault because I should have read the description in more detail.  This is like a plastic erector set, and not very sturdy, and really not very good with tomatoes.  It worked somewhat better with my peppers and onion plants, but not with the tomatoes.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.
B000RUM0R4 For the price I paid for these I expected them to do very well holding my tomatoes, well they don't.  I expected them to hold the tomatoes up nice and straight, but they sprawl all over the place and have to be attached to the cage.  I don't feel they work any better than wooden stakes or the wire cages and are not worth the price I paid for them.
B000RUM0R4 This cage is great since you can assemble it piece by piece around an already tall tomato plant without worrying about damaging the it with a traditional cage.  It does get a little tall and unwieldy so I use garden twine and tent stakes to anchor it in place.
B000RUM0R4 I like the design of this tomato cage, simple though it may be. I love that it is versatile and can easily be added to established tomato plants that have already started. It is easy to snap together and install. We did tomato starters this year, but since we've had such a late start in our area our starters have gotten HUGE, so I like the design of this cage, I think it will be easier to use than a regular cage which can't be adjusted.For the price and design, definitely recommended.
B000RUM0R4 I have always used the circular  wire cages that make such a confused mess in your garage all winter, and I won't be able to replace them all (because of cost) but I really kind of like this one.  It is at least as sturdy as what I've been using, easy to use, and \"open\" enough to reach the tomatoes in the middle.I have to say that it is probably taller than a tomato will ever grow in my short season northern garden but hope springs eternal.  If you live in a normal climate I think you will love it.
B000RUM0R4 I have used wire tomato cages for years, and have found that they are have their limits. The wires do tend to get bent, and adjusting mid season for new growth in plants becomes increasingly difficult.The advantage of this tomato cage is how it can be adjusted as the growing season goes along, and because the plastic making up the stakes is firm, yet flexible, it does not have the bending problems that traditional wire cages have.The ability to adjust the height of the supports is very useful, as the plant grows throughout the year.As a product for long term use, I cannot seeing this having the issues that traditional wire cages have.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried SO MANY things to stake my tomatoes. The cheap cages. Bamboo stakes. Bamboo stakes with twine. Triangle cages I thought would do the trick, but still weren't as adjustable as I'd like.But these. These are awesome! You can move the side sections on the fly as you need to which is great. Setup is easy and storage is flat. You can even just use the stakes if you want. This would also work great for lightweight climbers like peas.I LOVE these tomato cages and plan on buying a couple more this year and slowly stocking up on them as the years go by. I think these will last for quite a few years, too, so your investment won't be a one year deal.
B000RUM0R4 Anyone who has grown tomatoes year after year knows how quickly they grow out of control, regardless of how you \"train\" them or stake them. We have used the typical circular wire tomato cages, but they've always seemed a bit flimsy and too small; and you have the problem of storing them the rest of the year.When this new tomato cage arrived, I was immediately skeptical of the quality because it was just wrapped in bubble wrap with a shipping label attached, and our UPS driver just tossed it onto the front porch. Nevertheless, the parts were all included and in good condition. After snapping the horizontal plastic support pieces into place, it was easy to embed the plastic-coated metal vertical stakes into the planter box and plant the tomato plants around it. It's much taller than the adjacent wire cages we're also using, and it appears that it will be able to support the tomato plants throughout the growing season.I will try to remember to update this review later in the growing season; the plants are just too small right now to know how effective this support system will be.Another benefit is that it will be easy to disassemble and store the Ultomato Cage throughout the winter.
B000RUM0R4 I am so delighted with this ULTOMATO TOMATO PLANT CAGE! I've used the wire circular tomato cages for more than 25 years, and every year my tomato plants far exceed the height of the cage, resulting in the cage tipping over, tomato plants breaking or tomatoes laying on the ground. This tomato cage, however, is 5 feet tall and, although plastic, very sturdy. The legs of the cage plant firmly into the ground, which should result in no more tipping. Although my tomato plants aren't at full height at this point in the growing year, I expect little or no tomato plant to rise above this cage. It's about time someone came along with a better tomato cage! I will be back to buy several more!
B000RUM0R4 We've had some Gardener's Supply metal cages for years, and thought they were as good as it gets.  Nuh-uh.  These green gems snap together easily, are TALL and will adjust as your tomatoes grow.  If you're delayed in installing them, they can be fitted around existing plants without damaging them.  Genius!
B000RUM0R4 I was very excited to receive this Gardeners Blue Ribbon Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage.  I am planning on using it when my tomato plants get larger.  But for now it is staking up my raspberry bush.  And doing a great job of it!  This was sooooo simple to use straight out of the box.  The stakes are made from a sturdy material that won't rust or rot.  The clips are easy to place around the plant so that you don't destroy the plant while trying to place the stakes around it.  Also, the clips do not have to be parallel to each other.  So if part of your plant is heavy on one side and then on up a ways, it gets heavier on the other side, you can arrange the horizontal clips in any configuration you like to best support your plant.  When done this cage is very easy to store.  You just unclip the horizontal bars and everything wraps up with a twisty tie until next year.  These will definitely be something I purchase more of for the garden.  Some real thought went into these product!
B000RUM0R4 I have struggled with tomato cages for years and though this might be a solution. The long stakes are just green plant stakes, I had a bit of trouble getting them in the ground, and the side supports went on easy. Vine says I have to review in 30 days now, tomatoes are 17 inches high, will report back at the end of the season.
B000RUM0R4 I like this cage a lot.  The arms can be adjusted to where you want them, and snapped around the plant instead of put over it, potentially breaking the vines.  It's as tall as other stakes and cages I've bought.  The problem with the metal ones is they get bent up really bad and it makes them hard to reuse more than a year or two.  This one looks like it will last.  In fact, I've got this actually placed between two jellybean tomato plants.  I've got each plant staked with a plain straight stake, and then this between them with the branches trained and supported on the arm supports.  This is going to make it a lot easier to get to the little tomatoes as they ripen, especially when you want to reach and just eat some off the vine.  With the branches going back and forth through here, the clusters show up well.
B000RUM0R4 We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.
B000RUM0R4 This is a solid tomato plant cage, and can easily recommend.Pros:- Flexible arms (guide them to the fruit laden branches for support)- Tough stakes - hard to bend, will keep it grounded.- Can place it around an already growing plant (with a little effort, but much easier than a regular wire cage) without damaging the plant.- Stores flat - can reuse next year, and the one after.Neutral:- Look for sales, you can get them for a  lot less at other stores.Recommended, especially in the $5-7 dollar range.
B000RUM0R4 Unfortunately the product came damaged during shipping, and it was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It seems to be doing better than the cheap cages I have been using. I wish the product would be wider to support the plant as it grows bigger.
B000RUM0R4 As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers.
B000RUM0R4 The tomato went together really well.  It plants tomatos great!  The vines really go together really well.  They go right into the ground.  Great tomatos!  They hang really well.
B000RUM0R4 I am actually using this for cucumbers instead of tomatoes and so far it's working great!  It was easy to assemble and fit my pot nicely.  I have very little space, so I'm growing most everything in large pots and having something like this really comes in handy for plants that like to climb.  I am very pleased with it.  It appears to be very sturdy as well so I hope to get lots of years of use from it.
B000RUM0R4 Don't expect this cage can hold the weight of beefsteak tomato. This cage is designed for grape or cherry tomatoes.I agree with other reviewer that this cage is very sturdy. It is sturdy for small tomato plant. I have about half dozen tomato plants and I use the cage for \"sun sugar\" tomato, a cherry type. For bigger tomato such as Burpee big mama and other large paste tomato, I use the larger cages from burpee.com or gardeners.com
B000RUM0R4 I have tried various methods to tie, stake, cage, etc. tomato plants for years. I thought I'd found the perfect solution with this product. However, I have not. I should have noticed from the picture, that the cage (stakes) are merely green plant stakes. That kind the ultimately don't work to hold up tomatoes! The length of the stakes is really on the short side as well as the diameter of the stakes (a bit too thin) allowing them to bend rather easily.Putting the cage together was pretty easy and I do like that cross section. My tomato plants aren't full grown yet. I intend to come back and edit the review accordingly. For now, I'll say it's \"just okay\".
B000RUM0R4 Everyone by now has seen these green plastic coated garden poles, they are everywhere. What this company has done is create clips that hold fast to the 4 ft size of these poles to make a sturdy triangular cage, and sturdy it is. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because buying the poles and clips together as a cage is a very good value. The clips are approx a dollar each, and the poles are a bit more, so getting them as a kit saves money. Gardener's Blue Ribbon also sells the cross bar \"ties\" separately, so you can add them as needed when your plant gets large. Obviously, I am reviewing this in May, so my tomato plants are not quite at that stage - yet. I am buying more of these to replace the conical wire cages (good riddance), so let that be my ultimate review.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for two seasons now and just got around to writing a review. I'll probably use them next season, too, but I think potential buyers should be aware of some things.The \"cage\" comes as a set of three stakes and nine plastic bars; both ends of the bar snap onto a stake, usually assembled as you see in pictures (three groups of three bars, although you can really space them however you want). I've lost a couple plastic bars over the years, but I notice some local garden centers sell replacement bars, probably for this reason. I suppose you could also get them to add another set of bars to the cage. The stakes are 5 ft tall, but you'll have to put them into the ground a bit, making the effective height a bit less.The stakes are also somewhat thin, and the bars are easily removable. This is good because it makes for easy storage but can be bad because heavy plants--like tomatoes--can easily push the bars off the stakes (probably why I've lost a couple). Together with the thin stakes, this makes the whole cage somewhat light and definitely NOT suitable for indeterminate tomatoes. You may have better luck with determinates, but I've never grown any true determinates in these to test. I've given up on using these for tomatoes and have stuck to using them with bell peppers, jalapenos (probably could have done without any cage on those, but I had some extra), and cucumbers, which I more or less successfully tried to make climb up the cage. The removable--and movable--plastic bars on the cage were very helpful for this. I didn't have an issue with the weight of the cucumber fruit weighing down the cage, toppling it over, or breaking the bars off, but everything was much lighter here than my tomatoes. I suspect other plants like peas would also work well (maybe spread it out instead of putting it like a cage, depending on how you plant them). I'd hate to try it with melons or squash, but if I was desperate for space and had nothing else I might see how it works.In summary, these cages are OK, but you'll need to stick to lighter plants: *maybe* determinate tomatoes, definitely *not* indeterminates, and besides tomatoes otherwise lighter plants like cucumbers or peppers. If they didn't market these for tomatoes (including the name of the cage itself!), I might rate them a little higher. They aren't horrible, but you'll have to be careful how you use them. For tomatoes themselves, after having used a variety of tomato support methods, I decided to make a \"Florida weave\" last season with not much more than metal T-posts and twine. (There are also a few other \"homemade\" solutions out there.\") Do a Web search for this if you're interested--it worked out well for me and was much less expensive than buying cages. They're also easy to store, and I suspect the metal posts will last me much, much longer than these cages.
B000RUM0R4 This tomato (or any plant) cage is sturdy, adjustable and reusable. The three supporting poles are made of a strong metal core with a hard plastic covering. This covering has ridges which keeps the adjustable horizontal attachment bars from slipping down the pole when the weight of the tomato branches increases with the growing season. I have accidentally broken off many stems/branches in the past when trying to accommodate the growing plant within a fixed support cage - the plant grows or needs extra support when branches become heavy with fruit, and the traditional fixed metal cages do not allow adjustments without bending/breaking stems in the process. This design allows you accommodate the plant as often as needed by adjusting the horizontal bars of the cage as often as you need to.  They snap on and off easily and can be placed anywhere on the vertical poles. By connecting several cages in a row, you can build a network of supports for many plants.  This is the best method I have tried so far, compared to fixed square and round cages and wooden stakes. I have yet to use it a second season, and the plastic horizontal bars may not hold up to years of wear and tear - they are plastic and less sturdy than the poles. But each cage comes with many bars, so extras are available in the event of a breakage.
B000RUM0R4 Makes growing tomatoes much easier. The cage could be used for growing tomato plants and other climbing fruits and vegetables. It is literally a \"snap\" to use, as the horizontal supports, snap on and off with ease. Three stakes and nine adjustable support clips for changeable support throughout the plant's growth. The stakes have a steel core and a thick plastic coating. It may also be used , flattened as a trellis.
B000RUM0R4 This is only my 3rd year growing tomatoes so I am still a novice gardener. Since I live in a condo, all my gardening is done in containers--usually 5-gallon buckets. Even though this tomato cage is not intended for containers, I was able to make it work because it is so adjustable and versatile.The cage arrives UNASSEMBLED but assembly is easy. There are 3 5-ft. stakes and 9 support clips. The support clips snap onto the stakes very easily (it reminded me of a large Tinker Toy project). What's great is that, as your plant grows, you can readjust the space between the support rods to support your plant's branches and fruit/vegetables. This isn't something you can do with most other tomato cages.As noted in the product description, the stakes have a steel core with plastic around them. They are VERY strong. However, the support clips are completely plastic and I would recommend not being to rough with them during assembly or readjustment during growth of your plant. I did not have any breakage but, in \"forcing\" the cage to fit my 5-gallon bucket, the clips were definitely bending.I just put my tomato plants in yesterday so I can't speak yet to how well the cage functions in supporting the plant's growth, but since it is so adjustable, I can't imagine there being much of a problem. If there is, I will update my review once my plants have grown a few feet tall.I have never had a cage this tall so I'm looking forward to having less work this year in keeping my plants supported as they grow and bear fruit!I took a picture of my cage in the container with the small tomato plant to show customers, but unfortunately this company is not allowing customers to share their own images of the product.4 stars for now. This may change as my plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 Great tomato cage that can be added to your tomato plant at any time (and adjusted, as needed).  It's sturdy, adjustable, and green (it blends it with the plant and is barely noticeable).
B000RUM0R4 We plant 20-30 tomato plants each year, plus I use tomato cages for climbing plants, like peas.  The Gardeners Blue Ribbon Tomato Plant Cage is a sturdy, versatile product that not only can be used for any size tomato plant, but can also be arranged for other uses.The cage comes disassembled, with three tall poles and 9 side pieces. You just put the poles in the ground and then snap on the side pieces in any arrangement you would like.The price is higher then your typical cage and I would be a little concerned about keeping track of the side pieces once you put the cages away after the growing season. However, the durability and flexibility of this product outweighs the cons.
B000RUM0R4 Even though this product appears a little flimsy, it's lack of rigidity is actually a benefit over some other more rigid tomato plant growers I've used.  I've been happy with it so far.
B000RUM0R4 I bought tomato cages for $.99 each at the hardware store. I'll use this for flat beans. The one good thing is that you can do that, open the panels and make a \"wall\" of them, if you want. I hope for the price that it lasts more than one season.
B000RUM0R4 This was a great addition to our garden this year as I had planted my tomato plant before getting this.  I was able to add it after-the-fact without breaking the branches because I added the posts and then the supports.I love that you can adjust the supports to put them where you need the support the most, and that you can move them as the plant grows.This type of plant cage also makes it take up VERY little space when you need to store it.
B000RYL1NE I ordered the Yard Butler Gopher/Mole Bait Applicator to use with voles.  The method is the same: 1. Look for evidence of tunnels running through the yard; 2. Probe with the unit to enter the tunnel; 3.  When you feel the &#8220;drop&#8221; of entering a cavity, stop at that point; and 4) Turn the crank on top of the unit and dispense pellets into the tunnel.  It takes a bit of practice, but is easily performed.
B000RYL1NE After I've cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.
B000RYL1NE This Applicator works good, but my Gophers have not died yet, or I have not notice it yet!I live on 10 acres ,on a river, we have allot of huge boulders, where thegophers like to hide.So its not always possible to get into the area that there in!I have to plant all veggies etc. in Large containers, but if a  veggies drops to theground without a piece of wood there, gophers are on it, and of course at night.I'm not seeing the ground coming up, but mainly Gopher holes, that is where I'm sticking thistube at and realeasing the pellets into, then covering it upThat said, this Yard Butler Bait Applicator works very good..I know other friends that have this, and forthem it gets there Gophers..Going to keep trying to get those suckers.If I notice a big difference I will be back to give a up-date.
B000RYL1NE Every winter and spring its mole war around my neighborhood. I've tried countless poisons and old school tricks with no real positive results. When the opportunity came along to test this Yard Butler bait applicator I was glad to give it a test run. The instructions are mounted on the tool and are quite simple. It takes seconds to load and its one of the cleanest ways to apply poison. The wing nut does a good job of locking down the feed box. I got a pretty good seal without any product loss. I particularly like the mechanics on this puppy. The barrel easily slides into the tunnel for a quick application of bait. Two weeks later and no new mole activity. The manufacturer tacks on a life time warranty. So far so good. I have no problem recommending this great, working device. Its built to last.
B000RYL1NE Works ok.  It does get jammed at the exit hole at times but I kind of expected that.  The real issue is finding some sort of bait that will actually work with this thing and actually gets rid of your vermin problem...  The only thing that has worked for my occasional mole visitor has been poison gummy worms.  I will use this to make the hole and drop the worms in...
B000RYL1NE Our problem is with moles.  With the soil we have here in SW Washington, this applicator works great and it hasn't jammed on me yet.  Using disposable gloves to load this applicator keeps human scent off the bait.  Very happy to have this applicator, I wasn't aware that something like this even existed.
B000RYL1NE This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended.
B000RYL1NE If you have a mole problem, this is a great tool to help rid the yard of this troublesome critter. This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best.
B000RYL2CY Our hydrant is practically at ground level in an area that's frequently overgrown, so groping around for the handle in tall grass, stopped over, has always been unnerving (Kansas is spider country). This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.
B000RYL2CY I'm using mine next to my vegetable garden.  I am a square foot gardener so I have raised beds & I have to keep them fenced in with chicken wire or the rabbits will eat everything.  The fence has always been a problem when watering because the hose hangs over/on the fence & causes it to sag.  But with this yard butler, I can get enough height to clear the chicken wire.It was easy to set up.  I used a block of wood on top & then pounded it into the ground with a hammer.  Don't use a hammer on the metal butler itself or you will likely cause damage.Mine has been working for 2 weeks so far with no leaks.  From reading other reviews, it seems there are good/bad ones; I guess I got a good one.  I'll update my review if it goes bad.
B000RYOAHS This tool is great for loosening the top 2-3 inches of soil in the garden. It does take a lot of muscle power and you certainly will get a workout with it. The more compact the soil, the more difficult it will be to use.I would recommend this product for gardens where the soil is not too compacted and hard. In that case you may need a power tiller. This product is great for small areas. It helps to break up weeds, but not the kind that send long roots.
B000RYOAHS A bad back is a problem when you like to garden since pretty much every gardening task puts a strain on your back. While this is not a perfect solution, it provides for less back strain than using a hoe for weeding.The build quality is pretty good. It feels solid, but is lightweight to handle. The telescoping action of the handle is easy to use (simple twist lock) and stays put when extended except for the most severe pushing. The tiller blades (or prongs, actually) are sharp and each can be removed to configure the tool for specific tasks, such as edge weeding. The blades are held in place with a nut that goes right through the blade frame, which is far better than a friction fit that other similar tools have.The catch is that this is not something that will replace a digging hoe or tiller. It&#8217;s for light weeding on ground that has been well-worked. For that task it performs well and offers the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to use a lift and chop motion as you would with a hoe, but rather a back and forth motion. I find that easier on my back.It also works well to help spread out pine bark mulch, avoiding the need to bend as much during that task. The rotating tines even out the mulch better and easier than using a bow rake.The handle grip is plastic and comfortable. No need to wear gloves to protect your hands when using this (although gloves are never a bad idea when gardening).I&#8217;ll give this 5 stars since, for light weeding on worked ground it performs very well, and has good build quality for the price. I would not, however, recommend this for more strenuous tasks such as breaking new ground or tilling.
B000RYOAHS I have 5 raised garden beds and used the &#34;Yard Butler RC-3 Garden Cultivator&#34; to help me get them in shape for this summer's crops.This cultivator is light weight and will only be useful for fully established gardens. I had to pull the weeds that have grown over my beds since last autumn's harvest and the Yard Butler did a good job afterward in cultivating the soil.One thing I noticed was the small roots (from both the weeds and last year's vegetables) immediately got wound-up around the wheels. However, I was able to correct this by removing the middle wheel.The wheels, when all three were in place, rolled nicely forward, but tended to get stuck/bogged down on the return motion. Again, I corrected this by removing the middle wheel. Each wheel has a little screw-knob for fast and easy removal.At the end of the day, the Yard Butler did an acceptable job for a light-duty hand-powered tool. My garden is planted and I am happy with this product.
B000RYOAHS I do a fair amount of gardening -- previously, I'd been using a ho or a shovel to till the soil before planting.  This cultivator does a much better job of breaking the soil up into smaller pieces.  The handle could be better to hold (it seems sometimes like it needs to be at more of an angle or something, to be able to jam it into the ground).  I do have very hard, clay-like soil where I live, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  Generally, this does an ok job, at a good price.
B000RYOAHS This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but don't expect it to do much in harder dirt.  For the amount of muscle I'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt, I might as well just poke it with a fork.
B000S61YO2 The Yard Butler Roto Planter works beautifully in soft or tilled soil for planting bulbs, herbs, tomato plant and the like.  It can be used in harder, more compacted soil, but that likely will take more effort than it is worth.  I like to use it in a tilled garden for setting plants.Watch out when using this around roots.  If you have not set the clutch on your drill to give/let loose at a certain level of torque, the Roto Planter can become locked in roots, causing the drill to twist violently and suddenly in your hands, possibly wrenching your wrist.Use this for lighter duty planting such as that described above and you will likely be very happy.
B000S61YO2 I was looking for an auger that would be wide and long enough for greenhouse posts but not require special equipment. I used this auger with my corded drill to dig holes for the posts for my greenhouse. My drill isn't special, just your typical home depot drill and it connected to it perfectly. It dug very easily through my rock-hard clay soil with each hole only taking about 20 seconds to dig.  The trick to prevent it from getting stuck is to bring it up every 4-6 inches to clear the hole from debris. This will be a keeper for all the bulb-planting I have to do in the spring.I would definitely recommend this auger.
B000S61YO2 We bought 100's of bulbs last winter thinking we would get to plant them before winter hit.  However, as was the case across most of the country, winter hit hard and lasted forever.  Beginning in October the temperatures stayed in the 30's and lower and only finally got above freezing a few days in March, 2014.I was worried the bulbs might not be good any longer if I waited until this fall to plant them, so we went outside yesterday (May 1, 2014) and started the planting.  I expected it to take hours to plant all these bulbs, but with the Yard Butler it was so quick and easy.  We were done in less than 2 hours including a couple of breaks, and now I just hope the bulbs will bloom next spring.  I just won't know how successful we were until then.As far as the Roto Planter is concerned it is a super helpful garden tool.  Be sure you have a drill that will accommodate 3/8\" bits...a 1/4\" drill (which is most common) will not work.EDIT:  May 19, 2014We bought some annuals to plant in our flower garden this past weekend, petunias, marigolds, impatiens, and verbena, and because the yard butler had helped plant all the bulbs so quickly I purchased flats of 48 of each of those varieties.  Hoping this would work as well as the bulbs we went out on a Saturday morning at 9AM to begin planting 196 flowers.  Normally this would be a several hour job.  Between digging a hole with a trowel, breaking the plants apart from their containers of 4/tray, planting each one, and filling the holes with miracle-gro garden soil to replace what was displaced by the yard butler, it took us (two of us) less than 1 1/2 hours to do it all.  One of us used the butler, the other followed with the plants and covering their new home with good soil.  Now, we will wait and see one absolutely gorgeous garden in a few weeks!This is an essential garden tool!
B000S61YO2 I thought this product would help me quickly plant the hundreds of bulbs I wanted to plant, and looked forward to using it to get the depth and width holes needed for my many different bulbs.Boy was I disappointed.First, I was trying to plant many of the bulbs in soil next to perennials, many of which had great root systems.  When I tried to drill next to the plants, to plant the bulbs, I destroyed the root system.  Not good.Second, I couldn't get this roto planter to drill deeply into the clay soil we have here; the roto planter would freeze while drilling.  My HAND bulb planter worked more effectively than this product did.  It also didn't work in soil that had any small rocks in it.Third, this roto planter's shaft is difficult to secure in a drill.Overall, I think this product is great for  \"perfect\" soil, but wouldn't suggest it for anything other than rock-free, clay-free, root-free soil.
B000S61YO2 We planted about 50 bulbs in under an hour with this planter.  Our soil was relatively loose with some roots from the hostas.  We used a Panasonic 15.6 Volt drill without any issues with pop-out.  The roto planter easily dug the holes.  However, some of the loosened soil did fall back into the hole even when we reversed the drill.  So, we did need to use a small hand trowel to push out some dirt before dropping in the bulb.  We look forward to using it for weeding and planting bulbs next year.
B000S61YO2 i was very patient and practiced a lot of hole drilling with it. now i can do it real good. it works great for mixing up soil in my big nursery pots... in my compost heap... in my sandy soil.  i aerated my front yard with it using my electric corded drill and it was fun. i loosened up some potting holes for some hedge plants. it works great for me. thank you.
B000S61YO2 Buy this as opposed to the Awsome Auger in the made for TV adds.  It is strong, and not a rip off for shipping and handling.  It is a great labor saver for bulbs, annuals and loosening dirt in flower beds. Use a good cordless drill and let it do the work. Don't expect it to get thru roots.  And if the dirt is loose and dry, the dirt will tend to fall back into the hole.
B000S61YO2 My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest.
B000S61YO2 I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8\" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24\" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago.
B000S61YO2 We have a fairly large garden and have been wanting to plant flower bulbs around it, but the idea of digging all those holes was daunting to say the least.The Yard Butler made it so much easier! It's basically a small auger, that you connect to your drill and it digs the holes for you.  It was easy to use and works really well. Recommended!
B000SDKGC6 Ordered this trap and was impressed with 
B000SDKGC6 This is a well designed product, strong and sturdy. It is easy to set and remove. Unfortunately in six months I haven't caught a single gopher yet. They are tearing up our lawn. I'm switching to a different product.Perhaps I'm not using these properly. The other thing is our lawn is mostly hard clay which might not be the soil in which this works best. We've found the trap tripped a couple of times but no joy. I know others have had much better luck with this model.
B000SDKGC6 Easy to set and works!  I have tried other products to get rid of the moles, poison worms, deterrent spry and granules, and other traps.  Trapping seams to be the only thing that works and these are by far the easiest I have found to use.  I've even bought a second one I like them so much.  Make sure to find and active tunnel and keep moving them if your are not getting anything.  Good Luck!
B000SDKGC6 Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.
B000SP2JLU Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.
B000SP2JLU I've been wanting a bird feed for years, but never got one because I didn't want to lure the birds in and then have them end as cat treats.  But this little thing will keep the cats off (esp. using a shepherd's crook) and keeps the local raccons and pussoms out of the feeder!  I love watching the bird eat and flutter around the feeder.  Will buy this one again!
B000SP2JLU This is the perfect birdfeeder for my front yard.  I mounted it by hanging it from a Live Oak tree, using a \"hook\" similar to this Petco Green Bird Feeder Hanger and a thin, strong chain something like thisDroll Yankees LC18 Locking Chain.It's heavy enough when filled to hang well & the smaller birds like sparrows now get to eat more, since this is a bit small for our coveys of doves.  Occasionally, a young dove will land on top of the feeder, trying to figure out how to get some seed, only to close the doors for the other birds.  So far, the squirrel hasn't tangled with this, probably due to my precarious Rube Goldberg setup.I like the unobtrusive look of the feeder & I like that it holds enough seed for about a week of feeding (it's getting more popular; first it was 2 weeks, then a week, now about 5 days!).  It's relatively easy to fill; springs hold the lid on and can be tension adjusted for the \"right\" amount of feeder restriction if you do have a curious squirrel.  A winner!Have questions?  Leave a comment & I'll help you if I can.UPDATE 5/2/13:  Yet another advantage of this feeder is that its slim design handles windy conditions better than conventional feeders.  I live in Texas & springtime can get WINDY.  I briefly exchanged this feeder with a square one & immediately noticed strong swinging and spinning motions that were keeping the birds from perching.  Changed back to this feeder the same day & noticed how much less this feeder's affected by wind, due to its leaner profile.UPDATE 6/8/13:  A squirrel braved the Rube Goldberg setup yesterday & made it down the hook, down the chain, and onto the feeder.  Only to be TOTALLY frustrated, since his weight closed off all the feeding stations, just as promised : )
B000SP2JLU I've had this feeder for a month and really like it! I saw other reviews that say it doesn't last or doesn't work against squirrels, so I'll update this later, but so far I like it a lot.It was easy to fill and the hanger is a stiff wire, so I could reach a high hanger without it flopping over. The internal spring is adjustable, though I haven't needed to do that. There are multiple perches for birds to feed (6), and when I watched our pesky neighborhood squirrel defeated by it, I was very happy. That squirrel drives me nuts! It holds a fair amount of seed (2 lbs. according to the label), so I've only needed to refill it occasionally.
B000SP2JLU A simple yet extremely effective design for  keeping squirrels out of the wild bird seed. My only two concerns are at the two separate ends--the top does not open far enough/easily enough to effectively fill the feeder and the bottom while designed I'm certain to make cleaning it easier also makes it easy for it to be dislodged and all the seed pours out on the ground--something I discovered after a strong wind storm blew the feeder off the pole it was hung on, dropping it 4 feet to the ground. These two issues are extremely minor in comparison to the extremely attractive and effective baffle mechanism for keeping the seed away from the squirrels--if there was a way to rate this as a 4.9 out of 5 I would not hesitate. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends many hours every day at his dining room table watching the squirrels get frustrated that they can not get to the seed, no matter how hard they try. The mechanism for setting the \"weight\" allowed to gain access to the seed is extremely well designed and made--adding value. Again two very minor issues that other wise would make this an outstanding squirrel proof feeder! christina & bogie
B000SP2JLU I love this bird feeder.  I have several squirrels who constantly manage to invade my bird feeders, but not this one. The Perky-Pet Wild Bird Feeder is double sided with the interior tower made of sturdy plastic and the outer tower made of metalwork with tiny spings hooked to it. The feeder has six feeding ports with metal perches that let  birds  feed, but not the heavier squirrels. When the squirrels try to feed their weight causes the metalwork to move down and block the feeding ports. When the squirrel leaves, the spings bring the feeder back to the original position.  The feeder holds over 3 pounds of seed and the birds love it.
B000SP2JLU I love the beauty of this feeder, the birds love this feeder!  Well made with a heavy fixture and very clever spring that allows only light birds to pick out the seeds,Cardinals, Woodpeckers and the very small ones have a shot of the seeds.I used to have to fill the old feeder at least once a day!  As the birds threw out the seeds that were in their way to select that one perfect one!  Now, the birds select the perfect seed and cannot throw the rest out!I fill this feeder about once a week!Highly recommend this Perk-pet Bird Feeder. 5 stars
B000SP2JLU This is a light-weight feeder with plenty of space for seeds and birds, but I'm unsure this is really squirrel proof because of the crossbars.  Others have submitted photos showing squirrels on theirs.  The top deflector isn't big enough to be squirrel proof.  Since we live in the high desert, squirrels aren't a problem for us.  (They live higher in the foothills).  Our problem is neighborhood cats!This could also use some anchoring in a strong wind, but mine is hanging right in front of my south-facing window, high above the ground where cats can't go.  This feeder is easy to fill by removing the top where the metal wire is.  The design prevents seeds from flying out.
B000SP2JLU Here's the thing... I happen to love squirrels. They are my favorite animal. I don't mind feeding them, I actually enjoy it.  What I don't like is when my birdfeeders get broken due to gluttonous squirrels perching precariously whilst pigging out.  So many of my bird feeders have been destroyed by the squirrels and so much food wasted as it falls to the ground while they hang swinging upside down trying to feed.I moved my feeders out of the trees and onto shepherd's hooks a few years ago and that has also helped to hold off the majority of my fluffy tailed friends.  This product, so far, seems to be baffling and deterring my remaining stubborn squirrels.  So far they haven't figured out how to get to the food.I have only had this feeder for a couple months but I am happy to say I have yet to see a squirrel or a chipmunk feed from this feeder. I have seen a few try, and easily give up.It has taken my birds a while to get used to this new feeder and they still prefer the other feeders I have out there, but my regulars are coming back to the new one and I see the food disappearing faster.  I am hoping to see more and more birds - less and less squirrels.It seems like a sturdy birdfeeder and I think it is priced appropriately.  I like the look and the finish and so far have no complaints.  It holds a lot of food and I would buy this feeder again and purchase it for a fellow bird lover.Cherise Everhard, April 2013
B000SP2JLU I found the PERKY-PET SQUIRREL-BE-GONE FEEDER to be somewhat of a mixed bag.  While the concept is sound - springs lower the feeder when a squirrel gets on it such that the outside feeding holes no longer line up with the inside ones - the actual application leaves a little to be desired.  Since the springs are out in the elements and are relatively small, I don't give the feeder more than one or two seasons before water, dirt, feed, and bird waste fouls up the springs causing them to rust and seize up.  Admittedly, I have only had the feeder for about 6 months and it still works as good as new (as far as I can tell), the writing is clearly on the wall.The other problem I have is when larger bids land on the feeder, such as woodpeckers or a random crow, the cage drops just as if a squirrel got on.  So far no smaller bird had its head in the feeder whole when the larger bird landed, but I can see some mini-guillotine action going on if some unlucky Nuthatch was feeding the same time as my Pileated Woodpecker came along.  Obviously that would not be good for the bird - or make me very happy.All told, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the feeder too much longer because of the issues above.  It's pretty and appears to be working well now, but the drawbacks clearly out-weigh the good points.
B000SP2JLU I have two of these things.  Once is a relatively recent purchase, the other has been in place for close to a year now.  I have mixed emotions about these feeders and have had mixed results.  It was interesting to me that other reviewers here have had very similar complaints as to the effectiveness of this feeder that I have.Overall this is a good feeder and the concept is great.  It should be noted though that almost ANY feeder that claims to be \"squirrel proof\" is stretching the facts just a bit.  Squirrels are bright animals and if there is a way of getting around all the devices we humans attempt to discourage their raiding of feeders, they will find a way.  That is a fact.  Now I will tell you that this particular feeder is better than most I have used in the past.  We have been feeding birds at this particular location for well over thirty years now and have gone through a lot of feeders; both commercial and home made.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I estimate that we have at least 30 to 40 of the little critters living on our place - we live in the woods.  We have a very large number of bird feeders...always have.Anyway, while this feeder is better than most, it does have a couple of flaws.  First, the squirrels quickly learned that if they shake the feeder seeds will eventually fall out...not a lot of seeds, but never-the-less than manage to get a share of them.  Secondly, the springs which run the squirrel proof portion of the feeder are located on the outside of the container.  They are constantly exposed to weather condition which does the springs no good what so ever.  I keep mine treated with 3 in 1 oil, applied in very small amounts which seems to help not only with the actual working mechanism, but does inhibit rust and corrosion.  I have not had the problem others have had with the varmints chewing on the holes and enlarging them as of yet.The feeder is easy to load and is attractive.  It is more effective than many like products and I will continue using them.  I don't begrudge the squirrels a meal now and then actually as I enjoy them and their antics but to be quite frank, with the cost of feed and seed these days, feeding a herd of hungry squirrels had become a bit of a financial burden.Overall I am giving this one four starts but can well understand why some have ranked it lower.Don BlankenshipThe  Ozarks
B000SP2JLU I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
B000SP2JLU I filled it with bird seed and hung it out in a tree where I have a couple of feeders with bird suet and three of the bird socks filled with thistle seeds.  Then I waited.  It ususally takes the birds a few weeks before they will try a new feeder, but the squirrel only waited a few days.  The squirrel that likes to frequent our bird feeders stopped by one morning and his antics as he tried to get to the bird seed made my family laugh till we cried.  He jumped on the feeder from a tree branch and he held on until it finally stopped swinging.  Then he tried coming down to an opening to get to the bird seed, but of course the opening closed.  He kept trying all the openings, but no luck.  Then, he scampered back up the tree and down the branch to the feeder and holding on to the perches at the openings (which closed from his weight) he tried shaking it back and forth.  I guess he thought he could spill it onto the ground.  That tactic didn't work either.  He still hasn't gotten any bird seed out of that feeder.  I think the birds love it as I have seen them out there eating and I have filled it up numerous times now.  The feeder keeps the squirrel from getting the bird seed and it is a lot of fun to watch!  I highly recommend this bird feeder to those who love birds and also share their yard with squirrels.
B000SP2JLU I like this feeder and it is currently hanging in my yard and has not yet been broken into by squirrels. The one comment I would make is that if you hang this too close to a bush or tree with a near-hanging branch, those crafty squirrels will reach out from the branch, grab the hanging feeder and pull it sideways without closing the feeder stations to dump the seed out on the ground. However if you position the feeder so that the only way for the squirrel to get to the feeder is to climb up and on it, then their weight will close the feeding stations and preserve the seed for birds. For a hanging feeder, this one is relatively squirrel proof--if you can hang it away from other vegetation, preferably from its own pole. Recommended.
B000SP2JLU Have always had a problem with large birds pigging out on the bird feeder that we retired several years ago.  When you are buying a 40 lb. bag of bird seed every several weeks you know it's out of control.  We miss having a feeder in our back yard....The Perky-Pet 336 has at least for now reduced seed consumption by a huge margin.  Large birds like doves etc...shut down the openings while the little ones can enjoy!  Had to adjust the springs so it would take a lighter weight to shut it down, we do not have a squirrel problem.  Bought a five lb. bag of seed at the grocery store, the feeder took less than half to fill and it's lasting like I can't believe!  The larger birds feed off the seed than falls to the ground under the feeder.  So, for us, this really provides the enjoyment of the birds while keeping bankruptcy at bay!  Hope you enjoy feeding the birds as much as we do.....I would recommend this product on our very favorable use.
B000SP2JLU The Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder has turned out to be a great feeder. I have not seen a squirrel even come close to the seeds. The unit is easy to fill and the spring adjustment is useful also. Great product.
B000SP2JLU Squirrels are the bane of people like me who enjoy feeding their backyard birds. That's because, of course, is that if squirrels had their way they would consume far more seed than the birds.Because squirrels are very smart and crafty animals, there are epic tales of the extent human beings go to keep squirrels from getting seed from their bird feeders. My personal efforts are approaching epic. I spent lots of money, to me at least, for a bird feeder that tosses the offending squirrel into the air and unto the ground when they slide down to a perch. But the squirrels responded by simply swinging my feeder, spilling seed onto the ground, and then climb down to enjoy a meal.So Perky Pet has come up with an alternative bird feeder that might be what I need. The \"Squirrel Be Gone Wild Bird Feeder\" holds two pounds of seed and has six feeding ports. The feeder has an outer shell that slides up and down, opening and closing the ports. The default position is \"open\" so birds of any size - except eagles, hawks, black birds, doves, etc. - are free to feed at their leisure. If a squirrel or unwanted larger bird rests on the perch, the outer shell slides down slamming shut the opening to the seed.I am not mechanically inclined and cannot describe this next function properly. But it looks like the chutes by each port are designed in such a way that it will prevent spillage when the feeder swings back and forth. So this might be my solution. I am sure the Perky Pets company has very smart designers of feeders and other products; I just need actual evidence that they are smarter than squirrels. And my squirrels won't give up until a year of trying.
B000SP2JLU Update weeks later:  We didn't re-fill the feeder for several weeks, and only a few seeds remained at the bottom. Still, the birds kept flocking to this feeder (despite another one, full, about 25 yards away and similarly situated). I can't figure it out, but they really seem to love this feeder. When the other feeder is empty, there's no activity around it.Yesterday, we refilled, and man, they're going nuts! They seem to squawk a lot more at this feeder -- flying around and staking out a position, and making a whole lot of noise in the process. Again, it seems to be the same birds who frequent the other feeder but aren't so noisy. It's not really a problem; just funny how different feeders elicit different responses.Update several days later:  Still no squirrel, habitually demoralized or otherwise. But one thing I notice: Even though the birds are flocking to the feeder (mostly finches and titmice), it's hard to see them from 20 feet or so. They blend into the color of the feeder and the seeds. This might be a good thing if it thwarts the hawks known to frequent our pine tree but it does make it harder to enjoy seeing the birds.---This feeder is not as sturdy or as well-designed as our current squirrel-proof feederBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, but it's also less expensive.I'd say that this model is more appropriate for small, sheltered gardens where aesthetics and a more compact size are more important than rugged durability and functionality. (It's currently hanging in a mostly shaded area; I don't think the plastic liner would last long where our other feeder hangs, in full sun.)I see the feeder from my desk, and I've seen only one squirrel so far attempt it. It was quickly discouraged and went away.  Of course I can't attribute this to the feeder. Our squirrels might simply have been easily discouraged after too many failed attempts at the Brome feeder.
B000SP2JLU I have been watching this feeder for a few days now. The birds land on the feeder, take one beak bite out of the feeder then hop off and repeat. So the birds are using it but it seems to be slow going for them.
B000SP2JLU It took a while for the birds in our yard to \"catch on\" to how this feeder works.  But when they did, they  loved it.  Today there is light snow on the ground(not very often in Arkansas) and they are absolutely creating a \"bird mob scene\" on this feeder.  Thank goodness it holds a lot of seed and has a lot of perches.  And it's so pretty too....an extra plus.
B000SP2JLU I feel horrible about watching squirrels slip off of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  The handle is flimsy so I hold my breath each time a squirrel pounces on the feeder.  The reason I rated the feeder at a 4 is due to the fact that blackbirds are not deterred.  If anyone knows of a blackbird AND squirrel-proof feeder, please let me know!
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird feeder is a creative solution to an annoying problem, but unfortunately our squirrels seem to be smarter then Perky-Pet's designers.Prior to this feeder the only method we found to keep the squirrels out of our bird feeders were large plastic dome coverings. We put this feeder out without a dome, and for about a week the squirrels were stumped; they hung on the feeder, the metalwork shifted down, and they couldn't get any food. (Luckily, during that time they didn't try to chew out the plastic, as some other reviewers experienced.) However, they soon figured out that if they hung from the wire suspending the feeder, the metalwork wouldn't shift and cover the openings, and they could eat. We also had one small squirrel who figured out how to sit on the bottom ledge without pulling down on the metalwork. Squirrel party time! So, the dome returned, and now this is just a large and fancy looking feeder.The feeder is large, and wide instead of especially long. It holds 3+ lbs of feed, something to consider if you might have trouble lifting it overhead. It seems well-made; it stood up well to the week or two of abuse from the squirrels, and a variety of birds, from cardinals to starlings (unfortunately) have been using it since. It has only been up for a few weeks, but during that time it has both snowed and rained, and we haven't had any immediate problems with rusting or leaking, however time is really the test on that front.Overall, this is an attractive feeder with multiple perches, and is quite large. Whether the squirrel-proofing will work for you seems highly dependent on your local squirrel population.
B000SP2JLU I am a life-long avid bird feeder and I'm in the heartland of the country so I feed in all weather conditions. I also have to find a way to feed seed to birds without bankrupting myself feeding squirrels and deer or replacing flimsy feeders every year. Having said that, here's my review of this feeder:Pros:* It's pretty. And that's not utterly unimportant, as anyone who loves her garden would rather have a pretty feeder than an ugly one.* It holds a reasonable amount of seed.* Because of the design of the feeder holes, the seed doesn't spill much as it's being filled or moved.* The birds took to it immediately. Of course, as my yard is what my husband refers to as the \"All You Can Eat Bird Stuff-a-thon,\" they know the location of my feeders and so didn't need to \"find\" it.* It does, in fact, appear to be squirrel resistant. I hung it on a shepherd's hook without a squirrel baffle and only about 3 feet off the ground (thus, I did not need a neon sign that said, \"Squirrel Food Here!\")  And the next day saw two fat-tailed friends (and a chipmunk) on the ground under the feeder (Why they were finding much seed there will be explained under \"Cons.\") Had the feeder not been squirrel resistant, I assure you my little furry buddies would NOT have been on the ground!Cons:* The innards seem flimsy. The spring that makes the squirrel resistant closing mechanism work is small and seems not terribly sturdy. And it's  _inside_ the feeder, which is going to make cleaning the feeder problematic and, I think, will make the spring mechanism vulnerable.* It's not terribly easy to fill as it definitely requires two hands - one to hold the lid aside (resisted by the spring) and one to pour. (I also note that this took me a bit of figuring out as there is nothing in the directions that tells you how to fill it.)* While it does appear to be squirrel-resistant it is NOT deer resistant so, if your bird feeders are right next to a deer superhighway as mine are, they will get their tongues in the feeder holes and will empty this baby in very short order! And while they are at it, a lot of your seed will end up on the ground under the feeder where the squirrels will get it anyway.Having said that, if deer aren't a problem in your neighborhood, then you might not find this a \"con.\" (The only truly deer-resistent seed feeder style I have found is also by Perky Pet - and this is just one example; they have several styles:No/No Bronze Hourglass Bird Feeder  BZHG00325) However, without a squirrel baffle on your feeder pole, you'll be back to square one with those little beasties. So, if you get a squirrel baffle and a deer-proof feeder, you'll have spent a bit more, but will save a fortune over the long-haul in seed (and destroyed feeders!)Woodlink Ltd-Woodlink Audubon 6-Inch Torpedo Steel Squirrel Baffle.Conclusion: If you are a sometimes, only-casual bird hostess who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a squirrel resistant feeder, you may like this. If you are at all serious about your birdie buffet, this may not be the best choice.
B000SP2JLU A lot of \"solutions\" for bird feed loving squirrels are either ugly, ineffective, or both. This feeder hits a nice compromise of being both attractive and effective for discouraging squirrels. It is sturdy and well built and holds a good amount of feed. A good choice.
B000SP2JLU As with all squirrels ours are pretty darn resourceful. We have tried several different approaches. We have tried the urine scented tablets and granules without any success. and various different types of feeders with varying degrees of success. So far this one is actually working. the spring loaded cage that covers the feed holes when to much weight on them is a good idea and has worked perfectly so far. The only issue I have with this is that the springs get in the way of filling the feeder. Only time will tell how long the springs will last.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
B000SP2JLU Considering this is a 20.00 birdfeeder made in China it seems to be OK. Obviously the construction is low end, but the birds are finally eating out of it. It took them almost a month to use it which is very unusual for a bird feeder here in the winter. Have not seen any squirrels attempt an invasion yet and I hope they don't as I doubt this will hold up to many heavy attacks. Very decorative. This would be a nice bird feeder for an in town situation. Not too sure how well it will do here in the country.
B000SP2JLU [Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET.
B000SP2JLU I had this same bird feeder many years ago.  It deteriorated with age (springs went bad) and squirrels eventually chewed the interior plastic up.  Why then would I get another?It's attractive, holds quite a bit of seed and doesn't allow \"junk birds\" (grackles, starlings, etc) easy access.  Is it squirrel-proof?  Absolutely not, but that type feeder just doesn't seem to exist, even though so many (including this one) advertise themselves as such.  One or two squirrels may not present a problem, but avid bird feeders or those who live in settings with large squirrel populations know just what I'm talking about.For the past few years, I've taken a different approach.  It's not the feeder that's the problem, it's the squirrel.  Expensive baffles now surround all our feeders and squirrel populations gets thinned out periodically.  We have gray, black, red, flying and fox squirrels, and they're all Harry Houdinis.This time around, I'm not giving the Squirrel-Be-Gone feeder a chance to get squirrel tested.  It hangs from an unused basketball hoop, and is used exclusively by smaller birds, although I can attest it is not their favorite feeder in our large yard.  Next to it hangs a cheap platform feeder, used by a variety of birds.  Next to that hangs a small peanut dish, which is actually the most popular of all three.  Even Red-bellied Woodpeckers love peanut halves.  The whole set-up looks tacky, but hooray, no squirrel can reach any of them.The Squirrel-Be-Gone bird feeder definitely does not live up to its name, but if used creatively, it's an inexpensive feeder (especially if found on sale) that does keep out seed-hogging big birds.  I just hope the springs last longer than the first one we had, and maybe an occasional lubing will help.
B000SP2JLU I have been feeding birds (and thus squirrels) for a long time. I've had all kinds of feeders, and I have come to respect squirrel ingenuity. They are geniuses at figuring out a feeder's design flaw and getting what they want.Still, this is a nice addition to my feeder collection, and so far I've only seen birds feeding from it. I'm not, however, so naive to think it will always be like this. While the feeder is attractive, I can already see that squirrels will probably solve this temporary puzzle. Perhaps a better name for this might have been Perky-Pet Squirrel Deterrent (At least for a while) Wild Bird Feeder.
B000SP2JLU I like the look of the feeder.  It's attractive, and I really love that it holds over 3 lbs of seed.  It was good for about a week and a half.  After that, the squirrels chewed at the plastic, just making the seed openings larger, and the springs stopped working consistently.  The idea is great, the execution just needs a bit of work.  Our dog, however, was overjoyed, as it became the popular neighborhood bar for the squirrels.  He loves chasing them and got a good workout daily.  Made the dog and squirrels happy, the birds were less than enthused.
B000SP2JLU I have a few bird feeders in our yard, ranging from a hanging umbrella-top thing with a pan bottom and a simple plate on top of a stand, but when squirrels take over, and they often do, the birds get bullied out of needed feed. Weeelllll...Perky-Pet is a long (somewhat over 2 ft) plastic tube feeder. It holds 2 lbs of seed and each perch is a U shape, supposedly the kind birds prefer (who knew?). So, squirrel tried to nail it from above, but the surface is slippery... and it bounces.  Entertainment at an affordable price while feeding the birds that civilized people prefer.UPDATE: This is THE lure for birds in our neighborhood now. It does hold a LOT of seed, and they now flock and eat it up in a few days... much faster than before, so expect to keep refilling weekly. But oh, how cool!
B000SP2JLU I had a lot of success with the previous Perky Pet bird feeder I requested from Vine. During the fall migration, we had a lot more feathered visitors than usual--and by \"more\" I mean both in terms of sheer numbers and variety of species. Since we also have a high squirrel population (cute, interesting, ubiquitous and greedy) I thought the Squirrel-Be-Gone (SBG) would be a perfect addition to the yard.So, because we didn't have an extra feeder hanger when the SBG arrived, we took down the reliable feeder and replaced it with this.  In the meantime, I bought food that was a much better quality than the generic stuff we'd been using, hoping to reduce the waste.The SBG hung for DAYS and remained full.  Occasionally a sparrow would hop on one of the little perches and then fly away. We couldn't figure it out. Did they not like the feeder openings? Did they prefer the cheaper food? Maybe the cheap seed was the equivalent of fast food, and they were \"junk-food junkie\" birds.A squirrel did jump onto the shepherd's hook hanger and try to access the food, but after bouncing around for a few minutes he left in frustration.  So, the SBG does discourage Shadow-Tails.Then, we installed another hanger and filled our original feeder, and the birds rediscovered our yard. The feeder emptied within hours. So, they obviously liked the food.The full SBG hung there, still full, still ignored.Eventually, though, maybe out of desperation, the birds started to sample seed from the SBG. Mainly house sparrows, but you have to start somewhere. Maybe they'll spread the word that poking their heads into the little feeder openings will not get them guillotined.We have seen nowhere near the enthusiasm our original feeder triggered. But now that spring migration has started, along with a cold front, it will be interesting to see if we get more avian traffic.Perky Pet is a good company. Both feeders are well-made and attractive. The Squirrel-Be-Gone is easy to set up and adjust so that birds can get the food and squirrels can't. It's also easy to fill and clean.I am still not sure why it's taking so long for this feeder to become a hit with the birds. But if they start mobbing the feeder, I will post an update.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder one day before we got a snowstorm, so we had cause to put it in the yard immediately. Almost as soon as it went into the yard it quickly became the most popular feeder in the yard. Weathering the storm the next day really showed this feeder's strengths.This feeder is marketed as a squirrel-proof feeder. It's not, exactly - too much plastic instead of metal so a squirrel can gnaw through it in time. I would call this feeder more \"squirrel-resistant\". That said, being squirrel-resistant is actually not this feeder's strength though it is a big positive. The way this feeder's anti-squirrel strategy is implemented is by spring-mounting the wire sheath on which the feeding ports are mounted. When a squirrel gets on the feeder, its own weight works against it and the wire sheath slides down, closing the feeding ports. It does work, though the enterprising squirrel may find ways around this depending on how the feeder is hung.Adjusting the sensitivity of the sliding mechanism is easy. The springs that control the tension can be moved to increase or decrease the tension with one hand in about 5 seconds (if you're slow). This is nice - it does not require disassembly or special tools.Though this is a squirrel-deterrent feeder, that is not where this feeder's strengths lie. This feeder has two very good features that make it better than a lot of other feeders of its type.First, this feeder has six feeding ports, and each has a short perch that is suitable for small songbirds and very awkward for larger birds like grackles. We have more troubles with grackles than squirrels and as such this feeder is already doing well in comparison to the other feeders we own. Second - and this is very important - the feeding ports are designed to avoid giving up all of the seed in heavy wind. In the middle of a storm, it is not unusual to see all of the seed blown out of a feeder in a short period of time, requiring more frequent refills.The biggest evidence that this feeder is well-designed is how it attracts the songbirds. This is by far the busiest feeder in the yard now. With no squirrels or grackles chasing off the other birds and no wind blowing all of the seed out on the ground, this is a feeder that allows us to watch birds instead of continuously refilling the feeder.I am very pleased with this feeder and heartily recommend it. With this feeder in the yard, you will spend more time birdwatching and less time maintaining the feeder.
B000AC6DVS Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had."

B0016KZZG2 After months of dry carpet and adventures in the car, I am finally able to rate this product.  It fits our Nestl&eacute; waters and other bottles along the way.  My rough and tumble boy has only stepped on it once to squirt the water, and in all other cases it has not leaked and gave me peace of mind not using the water fountain. No more water logged shirts and scrambles for a clean cup while in public.  I really like this product.  Please note your child will make teeth marks on the nozzle.  My only complaint is that there are 2 nozzles but only one top (as the picture shows).  Why not provide a top for each nozzle?  We make it work though, and it was still worth it.
B0016KZZG2 We purchased this spout for our 2 year old and are wishing we would have purchased it earlier.Pros:- Non leak spout- 2 year old can use it easilyCons:- larger than expected, but doesn't harm its effectiveness.
B0016KZZG2 Works as described!  And it does create a kind of vacuum so the bottle will collapse as you drink, but still-- just pop the cap off and back on again and that solves that problem.
B0016M10C8 These are awful. They do not stay put. They are too small to cover vinyl completely. Should have some sort of slidproofing on back.
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0016NHN82 We used this tub for both our boys. I really liked how cushioned it was, and it was quite durable. The first one lasted about a year, and then we purchased another because we liked it so much. It wasn't the easiest to blow up, however.
B0016NP0ZA The Boon Bug Pod is a complete scam. I ordered the Boon Bug because I thought it was so cute, but when I finally got it, the only way to attach it to my tub was to drill into the wall. So I had to make another purchase of the suction cup bracket so make it work. What a rip off.
B0016NP0ZA I've used this on two different walls now. A fiberglass tub wall and a porcelain subway tile wall. It's worked great both times by following the instructions. I think one of the mistakes that people make is wetting the suction cups. I've done that too and it slides. The instructions say to use alcohol on the wall to make sure it is bone dry. It also says the suction cups need to be dry. When all surfaces are dry and flat it seems to work very well.
B0016NP0ZA I bought this at the same time as the lady bug toy holder because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.  It would be nice if this were included in the main product, but at least it is offered as an option and I think worth the extra few bucks.
B0016NP0ZA I had the taped bracket and it fell so decided to give this one a try. It has fallen once but that may be my fault (too much weight). It is great because even if it does fall you can just put it back up without having to purchase replacement tabs like the other one. I also like because we plan to move soon and I don't have to worry about getting this out of the bathroom. Would definitely recommend.
B001708AS6 I purchased this valance for our nursery and they look perfect!  I didn't want anything that was too pink.  This valance is light and airy .
B0017AE3BO The handle is nice to have and makes it easier to use. The bristles are just like any other standrd shampoo brush. Have never used the soap dispensing function, but I am sure it works fine.
B0017AE3BO What a waste of money. I am so bummed that I threw away the box & can no longer return it even though I only used it once. Seems great in theory but does not work at all! Soap did not dispense and I swear after using the brush it actually GAVE my baby flakes on her scalp! This is totally going in the trash
B0017LCZEU I made two hand print ornaments from this kit.  The dough was easy to roll, and I really liked the final product.  The ornament was a bit boring, so I painted it with glitter and glazed it for shine.
B0017LCZEU follow the directions closely and you  shouldn't have any issues.Mine turned out very lovely and i couldn't be happier. i did a bunch of them for christmas gifts too ( you can only make 2 from each box tho, i'm saying i bought more to use as christmas gifts)don't put them near direct heat or direct cold and they will last in better condition.
B0017LCZEU Skip the round mold and the straw that are included with this kit as they leave rough edges. Best to roll 1/3 - 1/2 of the clay into a ball in your hands with a sprinkle of water then flatten it out, ideally onto something non-stick, by hand or with a smooth bottomed plate that's also been spritzed with water. Immediately press baby's hand or foot into the clay in a gentle but firm rolling motion from heel to toe or palm to fingertips then quickly touch up any edge cracking with moistened finger tips.My disks took about a week to fully cure during dry mid-Winter. Even then they should be very carefully removed from whatever surface they're drying on and the back may still not be entirely smooth. The included ribbon is &#34;meh&#34; in quality and color and you'll need a thin acrylic paint from a craft or art store anyway if you don't want to keep the matte white clay finish. To add ribbon holes I used a low volt power drill with progressively larger drill bits until I got the diameter I wanted.
B0017LCZEU Since I was having my first child, I wanted to do everything. I got these around Christmas and tried them. the first time was a disaster. I followed the directions but the clay kept getting stuck to the cutter. finally I used my head and sprayed pam on the round cutter before cutting into the clay. best idea ever! if you get this, remember what I said. itll come in handy.
B0017LCZEU This is one of the best ways to preserve your child's hand or footprint.  Easy to mold and shape, dries nicely.  SOOOOOO much better than dealing with plaster!!!!  This material is awesome!
B0017LCZEU It went together easy and even held up to multiple kneading.  My son tended to grab it once we made the impression and so we had to redo it multiple times.  Eventually had to hold him upside down so the his catch reflex triggered and he held his hands out. LOL. But we got it and then it was easy to use the tools to cut it and the hole for the ribbon out and the ribbons were great. We were actually able to make two with one kit.
B0017LCZEU I actually spread the clay out to make 3 ornaments for Christmas. It was easy. It took about 3 days for the clay to dry in a moist climate.
B0017LCZEU This \"kit\" consists of:-A sealed package of molding material-A \"hole punch.\"  It is actually part of a drinking straw.  Literally.  It is the bottom few inches of a flimsy, striped plastic drinking straw.-A \"rolling pin.\"  This is a piece of dowel, about 1/2\" in diameter.-A wooden cookie-cutter.  Adequate for the job but leave sloppy edges.-Three lengths of ribbon: 1 blue, 1 pink, and 1 cream/yellowish in colorThe material is easy to work with and is a good consistency.  I was able to make 2 ornaments with a bit left over.  (I would not have had enough material to make 3.)  So, this kit will definitely provide what you need to make 2 plaques as advertised.  But given what it includes, it's difficult to see what justifies the price.  It's a chunk of synthetic clay plus a few pennies' worth of add-ons.Okay, a couple of tips for use of this product:1.  If you have a round biscuit cutter or cookie-cutter of an appropriate size, definitely use that instead of the cutter they provide - you'll get much cleaner edges!2.  The packaging said that the ornaments would dry in 1-2 days.  I did not find this to be true.  It took nearly a week before mine were fully hardened and dry.  I live in a desert climate, so I do not think humidity was the issue.  So, if you are planning to make these as a gift, DO NOT wait until the last minute -- give yourself plenty of lead time for them to dry!!
B0017LCZEU I though this clay came with the stand; the picture is misleading. It takes a few tries before you get it right, but works well!
B0017LCZEU This kit is very user friendly.  Easy to use.  However, the clay is too hard.  I'm debating whether to purchase another one because I think I need to apply more pressure when doing the hand prints to get deeper better prints.  However, I pushed down on the sleeping baby's hand pretty hard.  The cutter was bad as all the other reviews say, I used a box cutter to cut away the excess left from the circular cutter provided in the kit.  Forget about using the &#34;rolling pin&#34; they provide unless you want weird dents in your clay and uneven clay..I used my own rolling pin.  Given the price and the fact that 2 of the items included in the kit I had to use my own household item or improvise I give it 3 stars majority going towards ease of use.  Note: apply pressure when doing hand prints! Don't hurt your little one though!!
B0017LCZEU You could probably make your own salt dough and save some money instead of buying this product. I was not impressed.
B0017LCZEU We used this to make ornaments for our family members and it worked out great. If you roll the clay flat enough, you can actually get 3 hand prints. I used a glitter paint and added a touch of shine to it. Looks beautiful on our tree and we'll have it as a keepsake for years to come.
B0017LCZEU This clay works really well and is the old school type clay that captures every groove and fingerprint. I also used the pearhead kit but liked this one way better. Faster drying time and better imprints. I was also able to make 5 ornaments out of one kit!
B0017LCZEU Amazing ornaments.. Took about a week to complete.. But if you take the time to dry, sand edges, spray paint,then decorate, you will have amazing results! I glues a picture to the back of mine and decorated. Best time investment! They're only little once. I bought two sets and made 6 ornaments.
B0017LCZEU Cane out perfect could have probably made 3 plaques...very easy to do... Plan to do it again once he's older like school age
B0017LCZEU Very easy to use and you don't have to bake them!  Very please with this purchase.  I gave them out as gifts
B0017LCZEU Easy to use and enough to do the twins hands as well as leftover for a dog paw! It came with three ribbons so it worked out perfect! Takes awhile to dry but no biggie.
B0017LCZEU These were a pain to make and did not turn out well at all.  I didn't realize how awful the material was until I had opened the container, so it was too late to return.  I found this to be a total waste of money.
B0017LCZEU Clear instructions, extra clay, added ribbons. Everything makes the kit complete. Not too pricey compared to some other similar products.
B0017OAGHU Works well but its a little expensive. dawn dish soap works a little better and is a much cheaper option.
B000N5WPQY We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving, just stored it until we were moved.  So, moving aside, we drug this thing out and guess what? It worked for a little bit then quit.  It wouldn't restart, and then the motor started smoking!  What a ridiculous machine!  SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.  Brother!
B000N5WPQY Yes, I use my Mantis tiller every day to loosen up my horse stalls.  Not typical use for a device like this, but it works fantastic.My horse stalls have a sand base, and running the tiller over them every day keeps the sand loose and the stalls fresh. I've been using this tiller in my stalls for several months now, and it's running like a champ. It gets the job done done quickly and better than I could do with a rake.
B000NCTGQE I bought this greenhouse to over-winter some not cold-hardy plants on my screened porch. It was easy to set up, although I managed to get the side supports upside down, once that was corrected, the finished product looked very nice. The shelves are rather flimsy but hold my plants with no problem. Even though the weather has only been cold enough lately to use the greenhouse a couple of nights, when I took the ferns out during the day I noticed how nice and warm it was inside. For my purpose the greenhouse works very well, the cover is fairly heavy, it fits good, the tubing feels strong and the pieces all fit together. I'm very happy with the greenhouse.
B000NCTGQE I use 2 of these with row cover cloth over them to shade my heat sensitive plants in the summer.  It's much more sturdy than I was led to believe by some of the other reviews.  We have pretty strong winds around here, and it doesn't phase it.  Granted I don't use the plastic covering.
B000NCTGQE I have one tomato plant and I use this mini greenhouse to keep it warm at night. ( I do not use the shelves)It has worked wellThe only issue is this.  During the day it gets too hot.  I would love to find a mini greenhouse like this with an automatic venting system. So if it gets too hot, the vent/fan turns on to remove hot airThe do have these types if venting systems for larger greenhouses so it can be done.
B000NCTGQE My husband put this shelving unit together in 20 minutes.  He added tie-ons around each tier shelf to keep them from moving around too much.  It's a handsome little thing but I can tell just by looking at it that it is not designed for long-term outdoor use.  Those reviewers who complain that it gets blown away in the wind are not using this for its intended use.  The intended use is as an indoor growing medium with supplemental light.  A heated garage, a sheltered patio or balcony or a sunny spot in a large kitchen would be ideal for this greenhouse and users could get many years of use from this thing.The connecting parts are plastic and when empty this greenhouse does not weight much (thus its \"portability\").  The lower end is open to air, so true humidity would be difficult to replicate.The \"plastic smell\" goes away when left out to ventilate a few days after set-up.I am happy with this little device.  Here in Arizona this covered shelving unit works to keep dust from getting on my garden tools in the off season.  In the dry, windy springs here, though, this thing wouldn't stand a chance of lasting long outdoors in the direct sun.
B000NCTGQE Although the construction of this \"greenhouse\" is somewhat flimsy, with 1/2\" metal tubular supports and wire shelves, it works well as a temporary shelter/space for plants, as long as you don't expect to keep plants warm during frosty nights.  I use mine indoors during the end of winter for starting seeds, then move it outside as the weather gets better.This shelving unit comes with a plastic tent with a zippered door that fits over the frame; the door can be rolled up to cool the interior or to access the plants.  Because the tent is relatively thin plastic (think suit-bag on steroids) and not glass, it heats up in the sunlight but immediately loses its heat as the sun sets, unlike greenhouses that are flush to the ground and have thicker glass/plastic walls to retain the heat longer.  If you still have temperatures in the thirties or forties at night and expect to grow warm weather plants like tomatoes outside, use plant heating pads or keep the unit inside until you can be sure that the cold nights won't stunt the plants.  If you do get an unexpected light frost, however, the plastic works like a row cover, keeping frost from the leaves.  If using outside, place it in a protected spot or anchor it in some fashion -- preferably both.  Even loaded with plants, the unit can blow over, especially with the tent in place since it can act like a sail.With the plastic in place, the top shelf is difficult to access, particularly toward the back because rolled-up the tent door and overhang get in the way.  The other three shelves (12-13\" between each) have plenty of clearance, and all four have room for 2-3 large seed trays.  Grow lights (not included) can be attached without much effort, provided, of course, that they are the right size.  The wire shelves are not attached to the frame - they sit on top of the cross-supports - but will stay in place during light winds as long as plants are on them.As long as you don't expect heavy-duty construction and heat retainment for cold nights, this shelving unit should serve well for seed starting or even for a display of small plants.  I don't find it attractive enough for a permanent plant stand for inside the house, but luckily it's lightweight enough to easily move around and store.  I find this perfect for starting my garden indoors and then using it to harden off my plants.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000NCTGQE You probably need to make a few adjustments.  Firstly, the wire shelving does not snap into place so sliding a tray on the wire shelf would cause the entire shelf to fall off the railing.  I used locking ties to affix the shelves to the rail apparatus to prevent the shelves from sliding off. Also,  I would prefer the zipper to go both from top and bottom rather than just he bottom. If you have to water on the top shelf, you have to unzip the entire thing.  But good anyway.
B000NCTGQE We purchased two of these. We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems. We knew they weren't going to be the highest quality, but we thought they would do the job. We put a total of 6 small plants (herbs and vegetable seedlings) split between the 2 greenhouses. We also put things like our small shovel, empty watering can, and bag of soil on the bottom shelves. There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing, the box, or the directions. We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground. Pots broke, plants were tossed upside down, and everything was a mess. It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground. Once we got everything out, we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke. They could not hold the weight. That is unfortunate considering there wasn't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this. We've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one:Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels, Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides. For the front, we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable. Same effect, but at least we can be certain it won't come crashing down.--In case this review doesn't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves:-There is 12.5\" between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5\" of space at it's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports, you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better. This stopped ours from moving around so much....well before they came crashing down. :/
B000NCTGQE I used this greenhouse this spring.  We had a long wet/ cold spring this year.  I was happy to have somewhere for my seedlings but there are several things I do not like about this product and I do not plan to buy another.Pros -*Works well to protect seedlings from wind and excess rain if monitored*Easy to assemble*Inexpensive*Nice lookingCons -*Forget using the wheels unless your surface is smooth.  My older deck was too rough and the tiny wheels kept getting stuck*Easy assembly yes, but also easy disassembly.  Every time you move the thing it falls apart no matter how well you think you have forced the pieces together.  I also had to use some electrical tape to tape the shelves in place as they just sit on the rails and will fall off, damaging plants below.*With no vents it can go from warm to plant killing heat in just a few minutes if the sun comes out unexpectedly.  I used a wireless thermometer to monitor it constantly.  I finally cut a 6 x 8\" vent on either side of the top where the heat built up the most.  I left the flaps hanging and tucked them up when it was warm.*If it is really cold the plants have to be brought into the house.  This unit is so small and the plastic doesn't go all the way to the ground there is no way it will actually hold heat overnight, something owners of even larger 'real' greenhouses struggle to do.In summary - I previously had an 8 x 10 actual greenhouse but have recently moved and needed something cheap and quick.  This fit the bill. After using it for 3 months the plastic around the zippers is starting to come loose.  I monitored it continuesly as to the temperature, opening and closing the front flap and my home made vents as needed.  Everytime I left the house for an extended period I had to decide if I wanted to just put the plants out on the table and risk cold damage or leave them in the greenhouse and risk heat damage.  This is a useful item but is very time consuming to make the best use of.  The quality is ok.  Originally I was planning to break it down for easy storage in the summer but now I think I will permenently glue the joints and store it fully assembled so it isn't falling apart on me.  Either way in one more season I am sure it will be shot and then I plan to purchase another 'real' greenhouse or use high tunnels.
B000NCTGQE I don't know what the negative posters are talking about.  It took me 5 minutes to assemble this greenhouse and place it on my pool patio.  I've started two generations of seeds in this greenhouse without any problems.  The shelving is metal, the frame is heavy duty plastic with metal parts, and the cover fits perfectly.  It is a very lightweight unit so I wouldn't recommend putting it in an area where you'd be encountering wind gusts since it might tip over.  However, that's just common sense, or so I thought until I read the reviews here.Good product, decent prices, easy assembly, 5 stars.... and I just purchased another right before leaving this review.
B000NCTGQE There's frost danger in our mountains until mid-May. We're at 5,500 feet, and it gets hot in summer (up to 100F), but the growing season isn't that long. If you want tomatoes and more that will finish producing before the temp. plunges below freezing again, you either pay for plants a couple of feet tall - or you grow your own from seed.We've begun to grow both veggies and flowers from seed, and we've set up a \"sprouting station\" with a heated warming pad under a fluorescent grown light (I've reviewed them separately). We use Jiffy trays of 72 peat pellets each, that come with their own tray and see-through plastic top. But what would we do would we do with those flats of pretty green heads once up?The answer was this greenhouse. We set it up indoors, in front of the fixed section of a sliding glass door. Some daylight gets to it, but it needed more light, so I rigged it with 2ft. fluorescent \"under-counter\" lights, purchased elsewhere. That doubled the cost, but it made the unit self sufficient.Overall, the shelving unit is a little lightweight - but then again, it had to be designed to ship in a box for a reasonable cost. Once here, it was easy to figure out and put together - took maybe twenty minutes tops. The greenhouse is 2'3\" wide by 1'7\" deep. It's just over 5' high. That sounds pretty small, but in fact, it holds a lot. We've got basil, parsley, cilantro and more growing, and the greenhouse holds eight herb-size pots to a shelf. Or you can (just) fit two Jiffy 72-pellet trays on one shelf.The shelves themselves are wire mesh, and not fixed down, so I used plastic zip-ties to hold them in place.The clear plastic cover is pretty easy to slip over the unit, and the 2 x zippers are decent quality.I held back 1 star for these reasons: while most of the structure is metal rods, the end pieces are molded plastic. With our herb pots on the shelves, they bow a little in the middle. I'll probably end up cutting dowel to shore up each shelf. The manufacturer should think about beefing up those end pieces.Also, some worker half way around the world must have had a bad day while sewing our slip-over plastic cover - the seam on the front is crooked. Not bad enough for us to return it, but that's what we see every time we look at it. The clear plastic (or vinyl?) cover itself could have also been a heavier material.Those are quibbles. Overall, this greenhouse priced under $50 is one of the most reasonable out there. It is what it claims to be - a cute, tight unit.Recommended.
B000NCTGQE I bought this thinking it would be kind of cool to grow some smaller plants and flowers on but was disappointed... Though it it was easy to assemble.For outside use-  Without a sturdy background AND screwing it in for support this greenhouse design will fall over with even the smallest gusts of wind destroying all your plants... yes it happened to me, but i was able to salvage and retransfer a few of my starts.-During the summer months if you keep the flap closed the plants will not get nearly enough oxygen and die.  Also, in summer even with flap open I recorded heat in excess of 110degF causing serious wilting.For inside use-  Pretty much can only be used as a display for small flowers or to start plants in a tray (seed dome only fits in top tier) but kind of looks like crap with any kind furniture you might put in a room.All in all- Not a good buy unless you want a slightly hideous plant display or just want to look like you grow plants in a &#34;greenhouse&#34;.
B000NCUW1M I've used this stuff for years.  You have to be patient with it, as unnerving as it can be to watch the little critters march across your floors/counters.  How long it takes all depends on the size of the colony I assume.  The problem at my previous residence took almost 2 weeks to clear up (They seriously slowed down after the first few days).  The ants at my current one took &#60;3 days.  I don't use the &#34;spots&#34; they provide.  I use a larger piece of cardboard and put individual drops all over it.  You want the most &#34;edge&#34; area for the ants to feed from, so one big pool doesn't work.  Check your spots often to make sure they don't eat it all and wander off to find alternate food...make sure you keep it like a buffet, always full!  Although you don't want anyone to ingest it, as far as poisons go....I feel fairly comfortable having it around.
B000NCUW1M Every few years we get invaded on our hill top by tiny ants. All the neighbors tried different things and it didn't stop it. Then one got terro several years ago and bam. So we all now use it. This year, lots of rain and sure enough, they are back. Used it for a week and no more ants. I have even used in my car when they invade the car. I put it in tiny plastic lids instead of on the tear off paper (not such a good idea but product so great, won't remove a star.. just save flatter type lids).
B000NCUW1M Been using this for years and it is great stuff. Only issue is it dries up in a couple of days so you need to refresh the area.
B000NCUW1M Here we are in the middle of a major drought in Indiana and the only thing that is multiplying is the ants!  They are just thriving in the heat and they are everywhere.  If I set out food for the other animals the ants are all over it in minutes and they devour everything.  This product is a sure thing, it doesn't kill the ants in your home, it kills the nest and it is gone.I was unfamiliar with this product a few years ago and now I use it every year.  We found a few ants in our kitchen and they were so small that they were crawling under the door seal.  I got some Terro liquid and put a small drop on a few pieces of thin cardboard and placed them in the path of the incoming ants.  They immediately found it and within a few minutes hundreds of them were enjoying the bait.  They eat their fill and then take some back to share with the colony.  They even share it with the Queen (Which is really your target) and within a few days to a few weeks the colony is gone (Depending on its size).  The ants that eat it die within 24 to 48 hours and they are sharing it with other ants.  Don't disturb the bait and only replenish it if it becomes hard or they have consumed it all.  Just add a few drops and in hot weather, do this in the morning and at night.  The ants that find the bait leave an odor trail and this leads the other ants to the bait so don't move the bait.Terro also makes liquid ant bait traps that are prefilled and ready to use.  They feed the ants but protect the bait from the elements and it prevents the bait from drying out.  Leave the Terro in place for 3 or 4 days so you don't see any more ants and then you can dispose of it.  Terro is safe to use around pets and children and its active ingredient is Borax which is already used in many household products.This product works and it does its job quickly and safely.  It works both inside and outside and within 4 days you should begin to see the difference.  I believe in this product and I strongly recommend it to you!
B000NCUW1M I'm so happy they just sell the liquid.  Their ant killer is the best but I had switched to Combat's gel (in the syringe-looking thing) because the little bait stations Terro usually has available are dumb.  Ants NEVER go in them.  I have always just dumped the liquid out of them and threw out the plastic station.  Now I don't have to bother with that and I can put this anywhere!  I will say that this is a liquid and will run if you use it vertically.  The Combat gel can go on a wall without issue.
B000NCUW1M This is the most amazing product that I have used.  I put in it two areas where I either knew or suspected that there were ants inside my house.  Within 15-20 minutes, there were hundreds of them in a feeding frenzy.  The secret is to resist the temptation to spray them, since they eventually head back to the nest where apparently they infect others and where they all die.  So far, it has taken a little less than 3 days for the hundreds to drop down to a handful. Some didn't make it back to the nest. This is clearly a very effective product. You can get it for $2 and change at your local hardware store.
B000NCUW1M Living in New Mexico, we have lots of ants. We have used Terro for years now. We use it where ants are active and always put it on the floor. Don't put it on your counters. Perhaps we have many ants because last year we went through FOUR bottles of Terro and still had ants. It at least keeps them busy and in one place. They are very attracted to this formula. Whether or not it has been taken back to the nest and killed off any colonies, I don't know. I found that the traps sometimes will dry up before the ants can empty them, so I prefer the bottled liquid so it can be doled out as needed.
B000NCUW1M I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!
B000NCUW1M When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon.
B000NCWOKE I purchased this hose because I wanted a lightweight weigh hose I could maneuver around.  I also was more interested in pressure than volume.  I have been very pleased.  The hose is kink resistant and solidly built.  I highly recomend.
B000NCWOKE I have purchased four of these Gilmour 10 series hoses over the last three years, two are still working. The manufacturer specifies a lifetime warranty on their web page, but no-one from the company has ever replied to my emails. We have 3 hoses in the back garden, the third is a Flexon, which so far has outlasted two of the more expensive Gilmours, and it's a lot lighter.
B000NCWOKE I love this hose.  It replaced my HEAVY one inch hose that was hard to pull through my long yard.  This one is a joy to use, so easy to maneuver.  Will purchase again if necessary.
B000NCWOKE I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again.
B000NCWOKE Length and 8-ply construction of this rugged hose means that it will swerve you for many years. As such, it is a better investment than buying a 2-ply or 4-ply hose!  Length is ideal for use in any corner of my yard.  Couplings are tightly fastened.  Well-constructed!
B000NCWP44 Have really held up.  Much better than the washers I bought at the local hardware store, although you'd never know by looking at them.
B000NCWP44 What a difference a washer makes! It turned my leaky spitting garden hose into a well behaved no leak hose!  These washes are made from high quality rubber.  They are easy to install and fit the hose perfectly.  They are more expensive than the cheap washers that you can pick up at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks, but I think they will last longer and in the long run will not be more expensive. I have hard water and had to replace the flimsy washers every year.
B000NCWP44 Something that always gets lost and you need to have extras on hand when they get hard and useless. Or you risk getting very wet every time you hand water anything. A must have for homeowners with large yards
B000NCWP44 Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
B000NCWP44 These seem to work very well.  They are a lot snugger than the plastic(?) washer that came with my spray nozzle, and they have more depth and \"cushion\" than the old one.  I don't think I'll have any problem with leaks now.
B000NCWP44 What can I say, rubber hose washers, they work just fine.  This is hard to give rate reasons as they are just washers.
B000NCWP44 Came with 10 washers, at well less then 4 bucks its a great deal. I had a pack of these before that lasted about 6 years until I lost them, so I'm certain the rubber will stay good at least that long when stored. I've only used 2 of these but so far both the hoses don't have any leaks.
B000NCWP44 There seems to be a softer quality to this rubber that makes for a far superior seal with no leaks, as opposed to products that appear very similar but are harder and don't seal as well.
B000NCWP44 great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
B000NCWP44 I have been using Gilmore washers for quite some time now and of all the washers I've dealt with over the years this brand is consistently the best.  Now unlike some folks who have one or two hoses hooked up and connected, I have the things running all over the place.  We have a very large vegetable garden, a large number of flower gardens, orchard and grape vines.  We do A LOT of watering.Now some of our gardens, trees, etc. are located quite a distance from our various outlets.  Folks, we are talking four acres here with stuff that needs watering all over the place.  This requires multiple hose connections.  Now I have found that when I have a leak near the joint or main connection that in 99 percent of the time is requires a washer replacement.  The thing is, washers wear out, especially if you leave the hoses out year around like we do.  I make it a practice to replace all washers each spring.  This saves me a lot of frustration and hassle during the main growing portion of the year.Please note that if you run over the end of your hoses or hose joints with a car, tractor or lawn tractor, a washer will not normally fix the situation.  Nor, I fear to tell you, if you accidently burn your hose while burning leaves and brush, will a washer fix the problem...trust me...I know about stuff like that.The price here for a package of ten washers is quite competitive.  I pay more at local stores.  I will start ordering these things from Amazon as it will save me some bucks so I can replace burned hoses.Anyway, when you buy a new hose, check it out.  You will almost always find one of those little plastic washers either in the end or wired to the hose.  If you want my recommendation, you will get rid of the plastic washer and replace it with one of these Gilmores...you are going to have to do it anyway very soon so you might save yourself the headache.I always keep an extra pack or two of these around as I have little patients and when I need a washer, I need a washer now!This is a good buy and as a Prime member, I get free shipping which makes it even better!Don BlankenshipThe ozarks
B000NCWP44 I had the black washer in my garden hose and spray nozzle that came with them when purchased. They both leaked, so I purchased these red ones. They stopped both the leakes and I've not had any leaks from either one. I'm very satisfied, so far.
B000NCWP44 What can you say about them they do the job and must be used to keep your water where it needs to be and to keep you dry. theese are very good,thicker than others i have purchased I would recommend these!
B000NCWP44 I had no idea that the a good washer could make the difference.  They are very large and sturdy and actually fit our hose beautifully.  These are not the cheap, hard plastic washers you find other places.  These beauties really work and no more leaks.
B000NCWP44 Not much to comment on gaskets except that they serve there purpose in our garden hoses.  Somewhat larger than those you buy at a discount store.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an add-on item which means they ship free with a $25.00 order. There are 10 red washers in the plastic bag at a cost of $3.98 for the 10 of them. They are the exact size as the black washers that come with the Gilmour solid brass hose connectors that are known to cause cancer according to the state of California. These washers are made in China as are the Gilmour hose connectors for which I bought the washers. There is no cancer warning on the red washers. Replacing the washers is a very easy task. They do a good job of stopping leaks.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an excellent fit for my 5/8-inch hose ends. Old washers do tend to dry out regularly and the fact that Amazon carries these washers makes it much easier to replace them as needed.
B000NCWP44 bought these for my non heavy duty hoses that didn't have washers built in.these performed exactly as i wanted/expected.  leaks stopped, but functionality remained.perfect.
B000NCWP44 They seal just like they are supposed to and so far I haven't had any leaks. Right price, product as described.
B000NCWP44 You can't beat these red rubber washers. They seal so much better than the black O-Ring style. At least I have found them to be far superior.
B000NCWP44 Excellent hose washers, far superior to the cheap plastic &#34;washers&#34; found at box stores. I will definitely consider buying these again when the time comes (in a few years or so).
B000NCWP44 It is always good to have a couple of these as spares. They fit nice and snug in the hose that for the price I always replace them every other year or so.
B000NCWP44 Sometimes improvements don't have to be fancy & expensive - like these Gilmour washers.  Over the years it seems like every time I use my hose for something I end up wet in one manner or another.  All my hoses and connector nozzles have leaks at the connector point - if I'm lucky the leak sprays harmless away from me but alas about half the time I take one in the eye, pants, shoes, etc.  I still remember the time I got a good soaking in the upper front part of my pants right before company came over...I used to think the problem was in the nozzles so I would replace them more frequently than I probably should have (at $10+ per pop).  However, even the new nozzles leaked and sprayed me in the eyes/pants/shoes/etc.  Over the years it dawned on me (I'm not that bright) that it's  not the nozzle but probably just needs better washer sealing.  I knew what to do next  -> Amazon.com ->  search ->  garden washer ->  read user reviews ->  Gilmour Hose Washers.I'm glad to report that these washers work as advertised and can't beat the price (vs buying new nozzles).  No more leaks/soakings.  I've found I do need more washers than hoses - I insert mine in the nozzle heads and I've got more nozzles than hoses. 
B000NCWP44 I didn't intend to purchase these, but ended up buying them based on an amazon recommendation. I didn't realize how much I needed these and have been very satisfied stopping all leaks in my hoses and attachments.
B000NCWP44 This is a pretty handy pack of washers to have around, they are probably going to work better for you then any washer included in a new garden hose or garden sprayer.  Works even better if you put a thin layer of teflon-based lubricant on it like Magic Lube or something similar.  Prevents leaks.
B000NCWP44 I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!
B000NCWP44 use these to replace all the old ones that leak or are disintegrated. used for hose and hose connections  great with add on
B000NCWP44 Hard to say too much about these simple little washers.  Replace the crap vinyl ones you usually get in hoses and attachements with good quality washers and fix those leaky joints.  I order several packs of these just to make sure I can find them when I want them.  It's the little things in life that you appreciate....
B000NCWP44 They were ok, but the bag was torn open with one missing when I located it inside the box. Never had that happen before or since at Amazon.
B000NCWP44 These are for 3/4 garden hose and if your like me it's easier to change them than have a leak.  These are a little thin but still work well, I have needed to double them up once, because they were so thin.
B000NCWP44 I used a washer to stop a leaky hose connection and it worked. The leak is now between the hose female end and the connection to the hose. I don't think there is a fix for that leak except buy a new hose. The rubber washers work.
B000NCWP44 These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
B000NCWP44 Basically these are red rubber washers like the ones that were used years ago. They work fine. Many products made today come with those plastic washers. I find that the plastic ones allow the fitting to loosen up on its own, which is very annoying.
B000NCWP44 These are made of good quality rubber so they should function very well and last for a long time to come
B000NCWP44 Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know.
B000NCWP44 These are excellent little washers. We do a lot of watering here in the desert and the sun is out from about 6AM to 9PM so washers take a beating and we replace most every year. However, why anyone would pay about 10 bucks (Amazon's price when this review was orginally posted) for hose washers is beyond me.I just purchased a few packs of these now that the price has dropped to a little over 2 bucks... Amazon price on 5/11/12 was 2.22 per 10-pack. The price difference may not seem like much but I recently purchased a 50 pack on eBay for 8.38 so that's under 2 bucks per 10 pack and that's a whole lot of washers.This is a good cart filler if you're a few bucks under 25 and these are great washers. Heavy duty rubber has lasted me longer than the plastic and other types of washers that come with most hoses and attachments. We have about 24 connections that require washers because we pump from a canal, water from field hydrants and also use several hose bibs on the house. It's hot here, the wind blows hard frequently, there's no humidity and all that adds us to a fast dry in the gardens and yard. We hate to waste water so spending a few bucks on washer, especially the Gilmour rubber ones, is much better than the water loss from the collective drips from inferior washers. However, even these do get a permanent crease that hot metal on the hose ends and the faucets will leave and though they don't leak they are hard to reuse the next season.
B000NCWP44 The important thing is the fact that they are rubber, not stamped-out cheap plastic.  They'll actually what they are supposed to do, and they'll last a lot longer than the cheap plastic junk.
B000NCWP44 I purchased a hose at wal mart and someone must have jacked the rings out of it. I plopped these in and it worked like a charm.
B000NCWP44 Best use for auto irrigation projects.  No leaks secure the in near home prevents leaks to basement.Always have these available for projects where pressure finds its way past cheap washers. Well made and thicker.This brand and type best
B000NCWP44 Who can't use some extra washers; I can never seem to find mine when I really need one.  So I have this item on my Wish List to use whenever I need some extra amount to bring my order total up to the &#34;free shipping&#34; limit.  It is perfect for this.
B000ND3MGS This plant has been both more cold resistant and more pest resistant than the two dwarf cavendish banana plants growing in the same microclimate.  I bought the two cavendish plants at Home Depot with about eight leaves and about two feet high a week or two after I got this tiny nanner with four itsy bitsy leaves on it and they are all about the same size now.  We had two near-frosts that took a toll on the two others, but this plant never blinked at the cool weather.  So far so good.  It is now about three feet tall with no brown spots or blemishes of any kind, and no pest problems.  By comparison, the two dwarf cavendish plants always have at least a few leaves with brown spots on them no matter how often I care for them.  No fruit from any of them yet, but all things in their time. :)
B000ND3MGS Update: 8/30/2013:--------------------------------Plant has been dead for some time now.Update: 7/03/2013:--------------------------------This plant is just about completely dead now.Update: 1/13/2013:--------------------------------I managed to save the first plant, but I noticed a few days later after I've gotten the plant I noticed it was infested with spider mites. I used an insecticide on the plant, but it appears they already did damage to the plant. They were not discovered at first because they were all down inside the base of the plant. I suggest the seller (9GreenBox) to use insecticide on them ASAP.The insecticide I used isSafer Brand 5118 Insect Killing Soap - 16-Ounce Concentrate. It seemed to work on the first use, you should do it twice just to be sure none survived. If you're not sure if you have any you can look for small dots on your plant, move the leaf some and see if they move. If you're still not sure you can use a insecticide anyway.Also keep in mind this plant does NOT produce bananas. The image for the product is misleading. Any fruit it does produce is completely inedible, I'm not sure if the fruit will harm animals. I plan on picking them off and throwing them away just to be sure because I have three dogs.I've since then transplanted both of the trees into aSmart Pots 3-Gallon Smart Pot Soft-Sided Container, Tansince my last review. I used soil from my garden, yes it was not a \"great\" thing to do. But with the smart pot it seems to be doing good with it. Because the soil can get muddy when I water the tree it seems to do good with watering once a week. The only problem I have is with the first tree which was infested with spider mites.Keep in mind both trees came almost dead. But after a week or two of care it seems to come back and starts producing more leaves.For those of you that change your mind about keeping this plant you can grow it to the first flowering stage and get about $50 for it locally. If you let it flower fully then you can get about $110 for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Below is line is the old review-------------------------------------------------------------------------The I got the plant today, the leaves seem like their dying from the shipment. I'm giving it some emergency care to see if I can save it, two of the leaves were completely dead. I have it under a special light which acts like the sun. It's also in controlled heating at 80F.I suggest you expedite the shipping if you buy this, might be dead if you wait a week.Also, it seems like a second tree is starting to come up in the pot. I don't want to do any transplanting from the original pot until it's more healthy.I also have some organic fertilizer coming which I'm going to use on it.I'll update this review if I'm able to save it.
B000ND3MGS First of all, I can't believe these things survive the shipping process.Got mine about 3 weeks ago.  It was packed pretty well, but it was obvious one of the leaves wasn't very happy.  I transplanted it into a bigger pot after 3 days and put it outside where it gets full sun.  I have two new leaves already.  We'll see how it survives through the Oregon winter, but so far so good.  No complaints.Update 12/28/12: well this little guy survived through the first OR winter so I took it out of its pot and stuck it directly into the ground last spring.  I was getting about one new leaf per week during the height of the summer growing season and the plant is about 3 feet tall now.  It is now set to go for its second OR winter.Update 5/27/13: the 2nd OR winter didn't go so well.  We had a week where temps dropped into the teens and the ground was frozen.  That killed the plant since I hadn't mulched the ground or done any prep work to keep it warm, such as wrapping it with burlap.  I cut the plant at the base thinking I needed to start over, but much to my surprise, three new plants poked their heads out of the ground as soon as the soil warmed up in March.  They're now about a foot tall each and it will take a while for them to reach the stature of their Mom, but I'm thankful to have my plants back.  I will definitely take better care of them come next winter.
B000ND3MGS Hirts sent me a nice baby banana tree, in a four inch pot. When I got it, it did look small, with an outer leaf that looked brownish, and half dead. There was a leaf growing out of the middle, tho. Within a few days of receiving the tree, I transplanted it into a  larger growers pot, using very free draining soil. (Use palm soil, which is like cactus soil, or mix together potting soil, vermiculite, perlite, and turface if you have it too). This creates a very loose soil, for fast root development. Also, fertilize your banana tree quite a bit, but don't burnt the tree. Use a balanced fertilizer, 10-10-10. Keep it in the sun, and keep it warm.  I would take the plant outside when the days would go up into the 60s, and take it inside at night, when the springtime tempertures dropped into the 30s and 40s.  During this first month, the banana tree grew like crazy. The leaf that looked brownish, just dropped away. These plants grow VERY fact at first, in order to develop its &#34;trunk&#34;.  New leaves come out of the center of the plant, unroll, and stretch out, each one bigger, and thicker, than the previous one.  Now its about 5 weeks after ordering, and I'd say it doubled in size easy.  The 6 inch pot I have it in, is basically too small for the banana palm tree.  I've been busy, fixing the banana tree a permanent home in my yard, while it's enjoying its childhood in the 6&#34; pot.The location of your banana tree is important.  It should get as much sun as possible, tho be protected from harsh winter north winds.  These trees need mulched for winter, and the internet has a lot of websites, and Utoob videos, to show how this is done. I dug up the soil, in a 3 foot radius, adding a lot of organic mulch to the soil, along with a bag of manure. These banana palms require a LOT of food, and a LOT of water, in order to make these huge growth spurts. Only now, in late May, can I even hope to plant this tree in the ground. (I live in region 5.) You need to wait til the nights warm up, and all danger of frost is past, to plant these.  If its down in the 40s at night, it wont kill the tree, but it just wont grow.  I'm going to plant it this Sunday, in the well prepared soil, that receives full sun.  I'll fertilize it again, and make sure it never wants for water.  Then, sit back and wait for my instant palm tree! I hear if you can push the tree to create 18 leaves (?) in one year, it'll bloom for you. That's what I want to see. So, don't worry about those outer leaves turning brown, and wilting. Its how these plants grow. As the outer leaves die, know this: larger, thicker, taller leaves are rolling out of the middle to replace it.
B000NJ3R26 Wanted a simple, inexpensive system for the raised garden in my alley.  Bought last year's model but didn't set it up because one of the hoses was badly kinked due to the way it was packaged by the manufacturer.  Decided to order another one this year, figuring I'd use 3 sections of hose and 4 sprinkler heads.  T'was not to be... Hose construction has been improved, but same packaging problem resulted in similar kink.  Went ahead and set up my original one (I'm returning new one) with just one hose and two heads. The sprayers worked reasonably well, and the spray is relatively close to the ground, which I liked.  Five nozzles are included - three are a full circular spray, one is cone shaped, and one is semi-circle - but don't think this is a high tech system.  The whole set-up is fairly primitive. The sprinkler heads are light weight plastic - so light that the slightest movement of the hose shifts them , making it hard to keep them flush with the ground. They really need to have some kind of weight set on them to keep them stationary and stable (or simply made heavier in the first place) .  I ended up not using them as my garden has a slope, which meant they had to be propped in order to be level.  I wasn't confident they wouldn't somehow get knocked off kilter, and as this was to constitute watering for an extended vacation it seemed too iffy,,,,
B000NJ3R26 First, my product seems to have a differnet hose than the one pictured above - and it is by far one of the most inferior/poor quality types of hose I've encountered to date. The actual sprinklers are all plastic so no worry about rust - but they are also very light weight and prone to move about easily. In a nutshell, this product works but for how long is another question entirely. For just a little more money I purchased three hose remnants and sprinkler heads here on Amazon - of MUCH better quality. I'm glad I only purchased one of these...given the cheap production we'll see how long it lasts but suffice to say, I won't be buying a 2nd one any time soon.
B000NJ3R26 Needed something to water a strip of lawn and these fit the bill perfect they are plastic but seem to be well made
B000NJ3R26 Other reviews noted the low pressure, but where I use these, I don't need a lot of water pressure.  They work beautifully in a narrow area where you don't want to get water on the house.
B000NJTFPE This animal is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I originally replaced my perfectly good electric (with a cord) mower with the CMM1000 model 10 years ago and stopped dragging my cord around.It was like Christmas opening the box. Then I was disappointed in the fact that everything was put together. You did not need three hands to assemble obscurely named parts. They don't even care what angle you hold the mower at, as the battery does not spill. My lawn was so small that it is not even on the chart of square feet cut on a single charge. Following the instruction I plugged it in for 24 hrs prior to use. I was gearing up for an afternoon of mowing. I waved my arms around like Norton on the Honeymooners, disconnected the charger, inserted the safety key, pushed it to the lawn, and turned it on. It was so quiet that I had to make the motor sound my self. I used the mulcher mode so the rear bag is hanging on the wall. 15 minutes and it was all over. I am going to run out and find the best compost I can find so I can mow more often.-------------------------------------------------------A few changes have been made to the new model; the key is smaller. And some of the electronics were moved from the mower to the charger. I have not dismantled this one yet however the last one was very simple to dismantle as I replaced the batteries once after seven years.Black & Decker MB-850 19-Inch  Lawn Mower Replacement Blade
B000NJTFPE Smaller front and back yards, mow every 2 weeks on the average.  Have had for almost 3 and 1/2 years, still runs great.  Did recently have a problem with the power lever, a little plastic piece breaking off which made it unable to turn it on.  I opened it up and basically replaced the plastic with a nut & bolt and that part is now better than new.  This is extremely easy to adjust and to mow with.  It lasts quite a while on one charge, I would guess I could mow a baseball field infield grass (probably about size of my lawn) no problem.
B000NJTFPE So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase!After I charged it overnight, it mowed my 1/4 acre lot and big back yard without problem. No fumes, no oil, no gas, relatively little noise and it's SO much easier to plug something in than run to the gas station to fill a container!The push bar also collapses easily when you want it to, so it fits well into a nook in my already crowded two-car garage!I also like the idea that if I throw solar panels on my roof, I'll be able to fuel my mower with completely clean energy so I just may have to in the next couple of years!
B000NSGNOG This is sort of a difficult product to evaluate. It is supposed to help keep algae from growing in your pool, but other things we use in the pool also do that. So if no algae grows, is this chemical responsible for it, or is it just maintaining acceptable chlorine levels and this stuff is irrelevant?I originally bought it as a stab at getting rid of some black algae stains plaguing a few spots on the vinyl liner. It did not help those.However, we've had a VERY rainy, often very hot summer. Those are perfect conditions for algae growth, and I haven't been using any more chlorine or algaecide than normal. I have been using three capfuls of this once a week. I haven't seen the first tiny spot of algae try to get a toehold this summer. With experience over 19 years of pool ownership, under these weather conditions I would say that is very unusual, and very pleasant.Since adding this chemical is the only thing I'm doing different than years where I might have had to brush off a few algae spots, I'm going to give it credit. It certainly is no more expensive than using extra algeacide and shock, and those are responsive measures rather than preventative measures. Its better to have the algae not show up in the first place than to have to beat it back when it does.Recommended.
B000NSGNOG This is a great product if you are like me and prefer using natural pool products instead of swimming in chemicals. This is the second product you use to keep the phosphates down after using phos free. Phos free brings phosphates down, pool perfect plus phos free is the maintenance step to keep them in check. Algae feed on phosphates, so remove the food bye bye algae. Note when algae die they put off phosphates as well. Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid. I used a product called banish as I did not know about first aid at the time. I slowly reduced the phosphates after the outbreak although you can dump a whole jug without any issues.You must still watch your chlorine levels and don't let them drop, but you can use less chlorine, or in my case turn the salt water generator down some.
B000NSGNOG My pool can't function without Phos Free ... just a little bit each week keeps the algae at bay!  My pool is very hot (94 degrees in the summer) and even hotter if I run the hot tub; so some sort of algae control is absolutely required.  When I'm using Phos Free, the pool is algae free and clear as a bell!
B000NSGNOG use this if yo uhave any algae issues.  once you get rid of your algae, this will keep it away. i promise you that.  i found this item while i had a profesional pool company cleaning my pool.  when i went to the pool supply store, to buy it, the guy asked if i had a pool cleaning company.  i said no, and he said it is the best kept secret out there. one product that keeps you rpool super clean and algae free!!FORGET ALL THE CRAP ON THE SHELVES....USE THIS!  using this for over five years now and it works great!
B000NSGNOG I developed algae in my pool that kept coming back, even after treating the algae with an algaecide.  Well, I finally learned that to rid your pool of algae you have to first rid it of phosphates because that it basically the food for your algae.  And if you don't remove the phosphates, the algae will keep coming back.So, I first started with Phos Free.  Not the one labeled Pool Perfect + Phos Free because that is just for maintenance.  Look for the one they call simply \"Phos Free\" (by the same company).  That is like a shock treatment to rapidly remove the phosphates from your water.  Just follow the directions on that product, and then once your phosphate levels are down to an acceptable level (zero is best, but I've been told up to 300ppm is acceptable) THEN you can start using the Pool Perfect + Phos Free product on a weekly basis to maintain it.I now add the Pool Perfect + Phos Free to my pool once a week, and have not seen any algae re-appear.  It's been a couple months since I started using it, and I am very happy with it.***P.S.  I originally bought this product from Leslie's Pool Supply, but I will never buy any product from them again after I found out that their website rating system is rigged.  They will NOT publish a review about a product if it is negative in the slightest bit.  They will only publish (or maybe even write themselves) a review for a product if it is positive, so you never know if you're reading accurate/fair reviews or not.  I have emailed their corportate headquarters about this numberous times regarding my concern over why only my positive reviews are showing up on their website, but they haven't fixed the problem and don't even have the courtesy to respond.  Do NOT buy from Leslie's.  Amazon is the only way to go because at least you can read ALL the reviews and judge for yourself.
B000NSGNOG Boy, does this work! We had a green pool from the winter winds and spring pollen. This worked within 2 days of back-flushing and one filter cleaning. My gardener couldn't believe that the pools was clean and clear within one week (actually 3 days). This is the best price for the product but the nice part is having it delivered.
B000NSGNOG I just started using Phos-Free/Pool-Perfect this year on my 12,500-gallon pool.  It works.  The water is as clear as it was when the pool was first filled 7 years ago.  I use 1-1/2 capfuls once a week and no sign of the algae that showed up early-on this year and the water is crystal-clear.  When this runs out, I'll buy another container.  Simplest product to use that does what it says it will.  Can't beat that.
B000NSGNOG Being a new pool owner I don't know if by using this stuff I am eliminating the need to use other chemicals or not.  I have an automatic cleaner, use (3) 3&#34; chlorine tablets weekly and occassionally use muriatic acid to bring pH levels to where they should be.  I add 2 capfuls of the Pool Perfect + Phosfree weekly for my 22,000 gallon pool.  That's it.  My pool is spotless, no issues with discoloration, cloudiness, or smells.  Someone also commented that our water doesn't have that chlorine smell to it.  I don't know if it's because of using this or what?  Our chlorine levels are in line with what they should be.
B000NVDGFM I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
B000NVDGFM We had just purchased a couple of replacement bird feeders and wanted to get something smaller than the large domes for protecting the feeders from some of the rain.  While nothing will protect a feeder from a driving rain, this cover does very well for steady down pours and for light rain on our tube style bird feeders.The unit is very well made and is simple to assemble.  Both of the hooks pictured on the dome are included and they screw into the metal plate in the dome after you screw on a locking nut to each hook.  Once you thread in the hook you use the nut you previously put on to tighten against the metal plate.  This locks the hook in place so that it will come out with use.Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a rain shield.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a squirrel baffle, but so far it has worked sell as such due to its steep sides.
B000NVM2L6 Easy to use.
B000NVM2L6 I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window.  But very few want to perch on it.  Plus, it doesn't drain well.  After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window.
B000NVM2L6 Edit: 2 to 5 starsThis is a decent design and stays up well (and holds 2 cups of seed). But, the birds in my area utterly ignore both of the ones I purchased even though they bathe in the water-feeder right next to it. I have them on different sides of the house where the finches gather, and no-go.  They eat the seed it is filled with elsewhere, just not from the feeder.Edit:After several months of ignoring this feeder, the mother finches have found it in earnest and have taught their babies.  The finches used it all through spring and summer last year and are coming back in droves now that winter is warming up in California. The feeders are so popular that 6-10 more finches regularly line up on the fence railing waiting their turn!Now that there are birds inside or on top of both feeders most of the day my house cats are THRILLED. They have something so fascinating to watch just inches from their cat tree. My kitties spend 4+ hours a day watching birds and it has greatly improved their mood for the rest of the day; they're more attentive and loving.If you want to use 2+ feeders, place a second feeder out of sight of the first and the birds will fight less. I have a corner window (windows that come to a corner) and they the birds seem to prefer one feeder on each side vs both on one big window.
B000NVM2L6 Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
B000NVM2L6 I put this on a second-story window and it took less than two days for the birds to find it. So far, mainly the titmice, chickadees and house finches are eating from it. But I am hopeful that eventually I'll get some cardinals to find it. Its very easy to install...just read the instructions in these reviews about how to do it. Worked like a charm. I plan on buying more and putting them in various windows around the house.Update: I have now purchased 4 of these. The birds love them. I have never seen a Cardinal come to any of the feeders (they are hanging on first and second floor windows). I have mostly the birds mentioned above and wren, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers if I put peanut butter suet in it. I have gotten mostly hairy and downy woodpeckers, which are small enough to actually sit inside the box. But I got a red bellied woodpecker the other day. He was MUCH too large to fit in the box, so hung off the side and rocked forward to grab the suet and then leaned back to eat it. He rocked back and forth a few times, flew away...and came back many times. I have suet in cages all around the house. But for some reason he wanted to go through the trouble of eating at this little plastic bird feeder. DETERMINATION!
B000NVM2L6 This is a neat concept although I have not had any birds use it here yet. It's winter so I'm guessing by the spring it will fill up. I wish it was slightly bigger so that larger birds like a dove, cardinal could use. It would need another suction cup though.
B000NVM2L6 I have had 1 bird in it since I put it up..Have changed the food but they still don't come.  Would not buy another one. I think maybe a bigger opening would help..but
B000NVM2L6 No, the Perky Pet Window Feeder won't last forever -- a year or so before the suckers weather -- but while it's stuck to your window you'll be able to get a close look at our feathered friends, which can be so much fun for kids and adults.We stuck ours on the window next to the breakfast table.  The children got to where they'd sit so they could watch the chickadees and sparrows drop by to have breakfast with them.  And my husband and I enjoyed sitting quietly drinking coffee and doing not much else but waking up and watching them dart to and fro.I liked these small feeders well enough that every year I now buy them for the children's teachers.  Though I must admit that in kindergarten they didn't stay up long because they were too much fun and the little ones were paying more attention to who was dropping by to eat than their teachers (lol!)THE SKINNY:::Sticks well enough.  Can be difficult to fill if you don't think about this aspect before deciding on a site.  Didn't need cleaning unless there was a real downpour.  (You don't want the seed to get moldy and gross.)We highly recommend.Pam T and family~
B000NVM2L6 This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.
B000NVM2L6 Not only do we humans enjoy the close up bird views, but my cats think this is the best invention ever.  They spend hours watching and making little cat chirps of joy. Best gift under $10 one can buy!
B000NVM2L6 This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
B000NZZG3S This thermostat is a pretty nice construction.  The thermometer lead has a nice length to it.  The thermometer is pretty accurate and has nice response times.
B000NZZG3S I picked this up for my son who just moved to St. Louis... pause for involuntary shake due to cold weather... and it connects perfectly to a flexible heat wrap to allows him to keep a constant temperature on his home brew year rounds.  Good thing he works for the largest brewer in St. Louis!
B000NZZG3S No more turning on and off the heat mat.  This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.  If you want to keep a consistent heat under your little seedlings; this is the way to do it.
B000NZZG3S Used this thermostat for about five months, in a greenhouse, in conjunction with a heat mat.  It maintained the set temperature pretty well.  The only fault I can find is that the readout can be difficult to see in a bright environment such as a greenhouse.
B000NZZG3S This thing is such an absolute delight. Your heat mat plugs into this thermostat and then the thermostat plugs into the wall socket. Programming it is a breeze and the included sensor just goes into the plant bed. The only slight downside is sometimes the ideal heat may not be reached all the time. To solve this, simply unplug the thermostat from the wall and then plug it in again.
B000NZZG3S I have half a dozen of these thermostats to control 48&#34;x20&#34; heat mats.  The temperature maintained seems very accurate.  Heavy AC cable is overkill for controlling a 120W mat.
B000NZZG3S I just purchased my second one of these and so far they both have been working perfectly. There is nothing on the market in this price range that gives you a readout of the current temps with a nice bright red LED.Everything else is over $150.00........!Mine are actually used for ceramic heater.The Max current: 8.3 amps / 1000 watts
B000NZZG3S With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
B000NZZG3S If you bought the Seedling Heat Mat your going to need this thermostat to complete your set up, with this it's a synch to have your heat mat keep its correct temperature, very easy to set then you just sit back and let it do its job.
B000NZZG3S The digital thermostat works with the Company's heat matHydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat- there's nothing it can do on its own.It's ruggedly made, easy to use, program, understand and read. You might wonder how it works with the heat mat - you just plug the 3-prong plug from the mat, into the receptacle on the thermostat - which, in turn, plugs into the wall.I've had mine working for 2 weeks, and I can read it at a glance. I've confirmed that the temperature is what it says it is with a separate thermometer - bang on.I'm starting herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil and more) right now, and all the little green guys are up, and apparently loving the consistent temperature and humidity in the germination station.Recommended!
B000NZZG3S I have 4 of these currently and use them for all kinds of different things.It is very easy to use right out of the box and the temperature gauge is surprisingly accurate and they all have always been right on point with my external thermometers.Highly recommended!
B000OM82J0 This is some amazing stuff! It works fast and a great supplements for the garden. I'm never unhappy when I buy this product.
B000OM82J0 I've head from various reviews that it's just not the same as the 'old' formulation. Far as I can tell, it works as it always has. i've used this stuff for forty years, and it's good stuff.
B000OM82J0 This liquid is like having plants on steroids!We kept all of our summer geraniums &#34;juiced&#34;all winter and the result was obvious(not leggy,but full of greenery.It is really concentrated,plants love it and it is a great&#34;recovery solution &#34;for plants in distress.
B000OM82J0 I have been using this stuff since.....well, 40 years, and I still think it is the best thing out there to make plants stay happy!
B000OM82J0 I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance.  I've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden.  I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective.  I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference.  Soil, fertilisers, care, light etc were all the same but only half got the \"Superthrive\".  ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  It didn't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth, flowering, size or taste.  Obviously some people love this stuff but I can't see why...placebo effect?  If it was as spectacular as it claims, then why wouldn't it be a standard product for all commercial growers?  Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste...as do I.
B000ORYO4W I have been using a Hoover Spin Sweep for years (on my second one) so when this came up, I thought it would be a good product to review. My review is going to mainly be as a comparison with the Hoover model.Karcher better than Hoover1) Cleaner pick up. The Karcher uses a single round broom in the back to scoop up debris and deposit it in the bin. It does a much better job of cleaning up what you roll over. The Hoover relies on the front 2 brushes to sweep debris into the bin and tends to leave a small line of debris from where the 2 brushes come together2) Better front spinning brushes. The secret of the Karcher front brushes is they a geared to spin slower than the Hoover's. This results in a gentler sweeping action that does not fling debris to the left and right like the Hoover does, especially the faster you walk. The bristles are softer and do a good job a simply moving debris under the sweeper to be swept up by the back brush3) Dust bin easier to empty. It just sits in place and you do not need to push a button to get it out or press down to click it back in place. The problem with the Hoover over the years is the bin lock can break because you are pushing down in the same spot to lock it back in placeHoover better than Karcher:1) Easier to push. The Karcher seems to have a lot of gears to turn and it is noticeably harder to push than the Hoover, which seems feels featherweight in comparison2) Better with large debris. The Karcher has a &#34;twig catcher&#34; in the form of plastic fins that are supposed to keep large objects out of the bin, but it tends to get clogged up. Since I have a lot of little twigs to sweep up, this has been something I have to avoid with the Karcher. The Hoover seems to be able to swallow everything.3) Brush bumpers. The Hoover has bumpers with wheels on the outer part of the machine that do an excellent job of guiding the sweeper around walls and corners so the brushes keep spinning. The Karcher's brushes are unprotected and you can easily jam them to a stop against walls4) Steering. The Hoover steers easily and goes in a straight line. The Karcher seems to have a mind of its own and you are constantly adjusting it to stay in a straight line5) Reach. The Hoover uses the front brushes in a single step to sweep debris up at the front of the sweeper, so you can usually get anything the brushes touch into the box, but the Karcher uses a 2 step approach and you have to travel the length of the sweeper before the debris get lifted into the bin. Imagine trying to clean up under a table. The Hoover would get everything as far as you can push, but the Karcher would need more room to travel to get the same debris.6) Containment. This is something perhaps particular to my situation. I have to move the sweeper up a step to cover the area I sweep. Picking the Hoover up with the handles angles the front up as I move it. It also angles the Karcher the same way. But when you tilt the Karcher backwards, some of the debris in the bin falls back out, onto the rear brush and gets stuck in there and ends up being redistributed all over the ground as you move it, You have do extra sweeping to get it all up. The Hoover bin stays contained and even helps, because as the bin gets almost full, it can start coming out the front. The Hoover has a bigger bin, tooAt first I thought the Karcher was much worse than the Hoover, but as I used it more, I've come to realize it may be better for some jobs than others. It does a better job on driveway debris, for example. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.In the end, I would say use the Karcher if you have a lot of flat area with a lack of big twigs to pick up and you want a clean sweep (a garage floor would be good). But if you want an easier to push and guide sweeper that can pick up bigger and more debris, but not do it as cleanly, the Hoover might be better. I'm luck to have both, so I can switch between the two depending on the job.
B000ORYO4W Karcher's a great company. I like their products. This one is targeted to people who want to sweep concrete, as on sidewalks, driveways, and garages. The compartment that holds the debris isn't very big, so it won't hold a huge amount of leaves, etc. However, it is easy to maneuver and seems to be built well. If you are SERIOUSLY SERIOUS about keeping the concrete around your house fastidiously clean, this may be the right machine for you.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper was very easy to assemble. (The assembly instructions had no words, just diagrams.)The sweeping area is large. It's about 26 inches across (from the outside edges of the round brushes). The sweeper is very easy to maneuver and make turns. it has a cylindrical brush at the back of the unit and 2 round brushes at the front. It is not perfect at picking up debris, but I prefer this over the loud blower that we usually use to clean up the driveway.I like that the handles fold down to make it more compact for storage.
B000ORYO4W I got this push sweeper to do my walkways and driveway, because I hate carrying the leaf blower around, it gets very heavy after a while. So I started with my driveway, because now that the warmer weather is here, I wanted to sweep up all the dirt and salt from the snow, and this sweeper did a great job with that, but the compartment is kind of small, so it doesn't hold a whole lot, and I found myself emptying it constantly. However, it is very easy to put together, and very easy to push along the driveway and walkway. The good thing about this is that I can push it, and not have to carry anything. It does a great job with picking up debris, it's just the emptying it constantly that is bothersome. I feel like this should be geared towards the older generation that wants to clean their own walkways and driveways, but don't want to carry around a leaf blower. Or even towards people that have back problems, because you can lean on it while your pushing it. I just wish it had a bigger compartment so I don't have to keep emptying it.
B000ORYO4W It was quick and easy to assemble.  It is a cinch to push. It picks up all the debris. I use it on my sidewalks, patios, and my messy garage floor.
B000OV8OTY Works amazing.  Attracts fruit flies and fungus gnats.  However, know that this is really only a &#34;band-aid&#34; to your problem and may not solve your problem with one or two applications.  If you have fruit flies, the root of the problem will probably be left over food somewhere, check dishwasher, under the counter, take the garbage out more frequently.  If you have fungus gnats, it will most likely be moist environments and decaying plant matter, i.e. stop watering your plants so frequently.
B000OV8OTY I had a big problem with nats and this did the trick for me it took about a month but it worked like a charm.
B000OV8OTY These work well for helping control the mass populations of fungus gnats that seem to breed in the potting soil of my houseplants. The only problem with them is there is no good way to peel the backing off and stick the paper into the holders without getting the sticky residue on your fingers. I've tried several different techniques but I always end up getting my fingers all tacky and it is hard to get off even with soap and water.
B000OV8OTY These work great.  You stick them on little spikes, (if you can get them off of your fingers) and the little insects stick to them.
B000OWF7YI WOW!  Whenever I have trouble growing a plant, I have to look absolutely *no* further than Miracle Gro.  By the next day (assuming it's a sunny warm day) the wilted leaves and stems are guaranteed to look MUCH healthier and beautiful by simply adding only a touch of Miracle Gro.  No matter WHAT kind of plant it is, this stuff seriously works amazingly well.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Just last week my tomato and pepper plants were looking ill for example, and Miracle Gro completely gave those plants the refreshment and reinvigoration they so desperately needed, haha.  What a great way to help any plant that's looking wilted and weak.  Get ready for the surprise of your life!
B000OWF7YI this is another great buy , I use this in my garden all summer an my garden is the biggest an best out of my whole neighborhood please buy this if you have a garden or planting one it works
B000OWF7YI You can't go wrong with miracle-geo for annuals and perennials. Feed the as directed and you will have healthy plants. Am I selling the product, no! However I am a horticulturist and know plants well. At the same time I would not use this on my vegetables because it is a chemical. Again, good for annuals and perennials.
B000OWF7YI Which I found somewhat confusing, especially when I wanted to use it in a non-Miracle-Gro hose-end sprayer. Eventually I gave up on the sprayer and went back to measuring two tablespoons per two gallons of water. It's hard to beat Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I have read and been following all the reviews of this product so far. So far this product is working wonders on my garden, it is one of the ingredients I am using this year for a strong healthy garden. I am using this product for all my vegetables and flowers. I have 14 different varieties of corn, I have 12 different varieties of carrots, I have 94 tomato plants of different varieties, I have broccoli and I have cabbage, peppers sweat and hot, I have cabbage and herbs, peas and beans, watermelon strawberries and canalope, I have onions and a lot of other things and so far everything is growing big and strong. I am using one package a week it comes with eight packages and I mix it with water and keep it in a water sprayer. Do not dump right on plants and do not let the blue sit on the plants in powder form. us as directed will do just fine. I also used cow manuer in the ground before I planted and I make sure to water every day unless it is raining outside. But I do like this product and I do keep pictures and videos from day to day as to compare the different years to see what works and so far this product is working and doing a great job. I have very healthy plants that are bigger then even I expected.
B000OWF7YI This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
B000OWF7YI This has got to be the biggest box of Miracle Grow plant food ever.  When you get it, you'll be so happy!  It will last forever.  I use it on my potted fruit trees, in my sprayer, too.  Don't buy it anymore at the grocery store or home warehouse.  I can't believe the price!
B000OWF7YI I really wasn't expecting the growth for my Lilac bush. It exploded. A few days later, I looked and the thing was all over the place. Pruning time for sure.Picea abies 'Hillside Upright' got lots of bright, new growth as well. Hemlocks are happy. Just fed baby boxwoods yesterday and they already seemed to grow noticeably.
B000OWF7YI I bought this for my house plants and it's more than I'll ever need.  The tub is huge, and all I need is a little tiny scoop (it comes with the scoop) in a bucket of water.  This can also be used with the Miracle-Gro garden feeder, which is actually a more appropriate use for this given the bulk size of the container.I have a tendency to neglect my plants, just water them now and then so they don't die.  Every so often, I decide I'd better take better care of them and start feeding them Miracle-Gro.  They start greening up the very next day.  What a difference.  I love how they look when I feed them Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF97S If you like using Jiffy-Mix seed starting mix, comparison shop.  Even your local home center probably has it available cheaper.
B000OWF97S The price is great but found this easy to use and my plants doing great. So glad I got it.
B000P0DK1Q BROKE
B000P0DK1Q + Does the job, mixes feed decently with water if you don't tilt/shake it around too much.- Very on/off trigger, wish it was more progressive or had a light setting for smaller plants.  Seems like it's made for large coverage and or large plant watering.-Leaks slightly in a couple areas, around the head and somewhere around the trigger, but not terrible.Overall, glad I got it, does the job.
B000P0DK1Q I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market. I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product. It leaks now and it is not that old, does not dispense evenly, I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking.
B000P0DK1Q This carries the Miracle-Gro name, so I expected it to be good stuff, in spite of the low price.  It does work well, but my water pressure blew out the first one I bought (locally), so I had to get a pressure-reducing coupler--not a big deal--and now this sprayer works fine.
B000P0FHQ2 STARTED GROWING CLOVER?
B000P0FHQ2 This lawn food has worked great bringing my lawn back to life. after getting the weeds under control with a different product, this fertilizer has brought back the lush green color my lawn should have! As others have noted though, it takes many applications before you see the results and often you can find this stuff much cheaper in your local brick and mortar stores. I have found it for about 9 bucks at my local walmart.
B000P0FHQ2 This product seems to be very effective in &#34;greening up&#34; the lawn, and it is certainly easy to apply.  HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.  I also re-glued the one I had disassembled, and now IT works well, also.
B000P1TB9K A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder.  It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away, and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry.  There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels.  The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs.  But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper.  If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety, they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are.  You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced.  The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website.  They sell a full 15\" gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $8.00.  (At the time of this writing.  It my be a little more now, but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects).  They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system.  And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs. They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders.  The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear.  Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway.  From that time on they are never clear again.  If you're in the market for a baffle, especially for more than one, forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company.  You will be most pleased I believe... : )
B000P1TB9K This is one of my favorite domes because it is 18 inches in diameter. (Wide domes offer more protection.) The polycarbonate is thick and the hangers are heavy duty. It's durable. My only complaint is that the top screw hook is too long. Feeders need to be high enough off the ground so that feeding birds are safe from cats.This particular dome works best on feeders that have a ring or very short hook on top. A ring or  short hook allows the dome to almost rest on top of the feeder, and that's the way it protects the birds and seeds. In the photo displayed in this listing, the feeder has a tall bail for hanging. The dome hooks on the bail. But see how this makes the dome sit WAY above the feeder? That's not good because it exposes both the birds and seed ports to rain and snow. This style feeder needs the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II or any dome that has a slit across the top that is wide enough to go over a bail in a way that the dome rests directly on top o the feeder. Look at the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II and you'll see what I mean. Whatever you buy, make sure that the opening at the top of the dome will fit the hook, eye or bail on your feeder.
B000P1TB9K I live in Florida, a state that experiences almost daily monsoon like weather every day during the summer, with horizontal rain being common at least a few times a week. I purchased my first as a rain guard to keep my feeder dry.The reason it looks silly is because I have various Brome Bird Feeders which are quite long (12 to 18&#34;) and while the dome is super wide, it doesn't look like it will do anything. Then the rain will begin, my Florida wide gutters straining to handle the rain, but the dome &#34;appears&#34; to be blocking the rain. Immediately after the rain stop, I stick my fingers into each port to test the dampness of the seeds. To my surprise, they were fully dry. I tested this on one of our rainiest summers. Note - I do take my bird feeders down during severe hurricanes, but it did handle a record breaking 22&#34; of water in a 24 hour time period.When I purchased future bird feeder, I ordered an additional super dome. Combing the cost of this pricey dome plus a good feeder (Brome in my case), it can really hurt one's pocket book,  but it is hard to argue with success - on an almost daily basis I see feeding: 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 4 cardinals, 40 golden finches, 2 bluejays, and the random mocking bird or robin.
B000P1TB9K Compare this to the Tube Top Dome, 12&#34; Clear version available here on Amazon.  Notice how the handle goes through the dome on that one, compared to attaching to a hook on this one.  The closer your feeder is to the dome, the better it will be protected.  Just an observation that may help you with your selection process.
B000P71GLU I love this thing.  Without bending over I can make holes in seconds even in hard packed dirt, then just plug in the little plants and you're done.  I have lots of tree roots to contend with and with this tool, I know right away if the spot I've picked is suitable or if a large root lurks below the surface and I should move my hole a couple of inches.  The hole this unit makes is ideal for the small plants in flat trays--and of course, bulbs.  For larger sized plants, I can make several holes right together or just wiggle the auger to enlarge the cavity and so far have been able to make holes for plants in pots up to 3\" pretty easily.  I wish I'd discovered this thing years ago.  It makes spring planting soooo much easier.
B000P71GLU I have just about worn out the auger that I purchased here.  I started out planting bulbs.  Then found it was an easy was to collect soil samples several inched deep in untilled soil, was good to drill holes for installing deep tree watering ports and turning my compost pile.  It has worked for me in loose/loamy soil, southern red clay and rocky southern red clay.  It has done the job in all (using an 18 v drill).Advice:  If drilling into moist clay soil, it tends to drill straight down like a screw.  I have to hold it back to auger the damp clay out of the hole.After hundreds of holes, the lower half has worn to a cone but still works well.
B000P71GLU I had only one use for this digger and that was to help aerate the yard.  Red clay compacts easily and makes grass growing close to impossible without aeration.  Renting those big bulky machines is O.K. but I wanted something like this and this is fantastic.May 17, 2012 added:  Please add young trees to the list of Bye, Byes.  About now the Red Bud Trees have started growing to about 1' to 2' and they can really take hold in the soil.  I attacked them with the Yard Butler and by golly they are gone with a few turns and NO bending or backaches.  I continue to be delighted with this tool and it is always ready to use.The length (30\") reduces the need to bend down.  The hole diameter is better than the smaller types and works beautifully in most soils.  Rocks are a nag and depending on the torque set on the drill the Yard Butler will stop when they are too thick or not worthy of messing with the drill's abilities.  If the rock is too large perhaps digging it out would be more satisfactory.  My attitude is dig a hole as deep as it can go and the rest will take care of itself.  My initial trip at drilling the yard centered on bare spots and I drilled holes about 2\" to 3\" apart to cover the hole.  Return trips included inspections to find other weak grass spots with the objective of reducing the compaction.  So far so good.  Not much apparent wear on the drill yet.The best part of this gem is the \"weed attacker\" aspects.  Put the point on the crown of the weed and turn the drill on.  The tool literally winds the weed onto the tool and all I have to do is take the weed off the tool.  Gone are the roots and the weeds.  So far I have only used this on mostly chick weed and one or two dandelions.  Earlier applications of weed killer eliminated most of the dandelions but like MacArthur, they will return.Great tool for exactly what it is to be used for.  Thanks for making my life a little easier.
B000P71GLU I have the shorter version of this roto digger, but needed the extra length for my back, what a great back saver this is. I use this for annuals also so I don't have to bend so much. Love, Love, Love.
B000P71GLU I got this to do some spot holes in my rather hard packed lawn and it is perfect. I use it to make &#34;spot&#34; areas to overseed grass,I drill a series of shallow holes close together, spread the seed, the cover over.a lot eaiser than doing the whole lawn.note that you will need a 3/8 inch drill.Mine has an adjustable torque, so I can set it and if the drill gets bogged down, it just will stop, then I can reset and start again.
B000P71GLU With almost 400 bulbs and perennials to plant I knew my spade would not hold up (or my back).  Popping this little guy on the end of my drill made the job a breeze.  Be careful to set your clutch low enough that you don't twist your wrist off should it hit a rock or hard spot.  400 holes and it still digs like it did on the very first hole.  This is one of my better purchases this year; really don't know why on earth I hand dug holes when for under 15 bucks I could have saved myself the trouble.  If you're a gardener, and don't have one -- buy this now.  Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner.
B000P7345G This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )
B000P7345G This is the best fertilizer to supplement your container grown tomatoes.  Dissolve in water and feed every 7-14 days.  Special formula designed for tomatoes.  Contains Magnesium which helps prevent blossum end rot in tomatoes.
B000P7345G Yes, I know that too much watering makes your tomatoes a bit dull tasting.  So, I knew better than to over-water.  But, the fruit was just not quite as tasty as other years.  We routinely apply the Miracle Gro liquid fertilizer for vegetables, but something was missing.  So, I tried this fertilizer, and there was a marked improvement in taste.  Great product!  I just wish they made this in the bottled form that screws into the sprayer they sell for attaching to a hose.  It would be so much easier.  Maybe next year....
B000P7345G I have used Miracle Grow all year and my yields for all veggies and tomatoes are very high and the growth of my tomatoes is unbelievalbly big.
B000P7345G Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas.
B000P7345G This is a God send for all plants. It nourishes even dieing plants back to life. I would but it again.
B000P7345G REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation.  Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England.  Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms.Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight.  You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes.I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously.So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants.  Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight.Watch for youtubegarden.com, for more info.--------------------------------------------------I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden).If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground.  It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot.  Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry.  If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part.I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant.  1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size.  Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it.  Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil.  I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do.  I have never lost a plant doing this.  People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants.  But I have never used any technique like this.  Hose water is fine as is rain water.I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit.  I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job.After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations.  I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me.  About a gallon for every three plants when they are young.  A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more.  The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it.I use a bucket or watering can for mixing.  I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer.  But your mileage may vary.When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer.  I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production.  Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine.  Just absolutely no nitrogen.I have tried other fertilizers for my plants.  Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all.  I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants.
B000P7345G Buying from Amazon with prime has really made shopping at local stores far and few between. I order this product from Amazon every year. This stuff will help and make you look like a person with a real green thumb for gardening. Just use one table spoon per gallon of water and pour. Use it every two weeks. You will be blown away how your tomato plants will blossom and grow. I didn't use it on two of the same kind of plants to see if I could tell the difference. Trust me on this..... Those two were half the size as the plants I used this on. So I know this product works better than it says it does. Try it and you will be amazed how good it honestly really works!!!
B000P7345G I like this because I can mix up a batch and use it any way I want. Spray, soak or dunk this is easy to use.  You don't need much of it so the 3lb bag will be in use next year too.  I'll buy more when this runs out, in a year or two. You know the only way I dont use this is in the hose sprayer it's made for.  I don't think it would last as long burning a bag that way.
B000P7345G I used this on my tomato plants and they seem to respond well to this treatment. You have to use it every week, but it doesn't take much and with last me this season.
B000P7FVX4 Bought this to use as a roof sunshade and a privacy shade on a side of the deck close to our neighbors house. Doubled up it functions *alright* as a privacy shade, and certainly more economic then any other options. As a sunshade for a roof you couldn't ask for more. It really does not reduce light visibility that much and you get the hot sun off of you. You can buy clips and fasteners for it from plenty of places, I just went with wood staples and they work great - no tears/rips or any issues otherwise. All in all a great product that I would recommend.
B000P7FVX4 This stuff is great.I installed some on top of my pergola.  I simply nailed the cloth into the boards with several dozen roofing nails.  We've had severe weather, hail, drought, and the fabric looks exactly as it did when I installed it.It definitely provides effective protection from the sun, though I did wind up modifying the design of the pergola to better position more fabric in the best spots.The price is hard to beat, and the stuff is forgiving and easy to work with.
B000P7FVX4 I have a deck with a high roof that at times in the day produces a lot of glare.  Shades work well for the 8 feet between a support beam and the deck floor.  We cut this to fit the top triangle above the support beam.  It does an excellent job of blocking the sun.  We have stapled it into place.  It is porous enough to allow for excellent air flow and has not torn or come lose even on windy days.Very please with this product.  I also have deck shades by the same company and am thrilled with them as well.
B000P7FVX4 Maybe I should have bought the \"authorized\" hanging tools but I used grommets and the fabric is ripping at that point from the wind blowing.  I am concerned about making it more secure as I am not sure if it will rip more if it cant move or rip more if its whipping around.But I do like the look of the fabric and that I can still see out through the fabric.  I would buy it again but have to get a better way of securing it and/or not use it in a windy area (not sure where that would be considering its designed purpose).
B000P7FVX4 I got a roll to cover my small patio.  It blocks the sun well, is sturdy. It is for sure worth it to get this product.
B000P9URDQ I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that have found a way into our home. I set it up last night and sure enough shortly after I went to bed I heard the SNAP! Dead mouse. Unfortunately this trap is a pain in the butt to set. There is a little plastic hook that holds the metal spring down and it just doesnt want to stay. After playing with it for a while I manage to get it to hold but I do wish it was a bit easier to set.
B000P9URDQ These traps are really effective; you place a small amount of bait (I use peanut butter applied with a toothpick) in a little bait-cup, close the cover, and slowly move the set-lever back until it locks.  Unlike traditional spring-traps there is no way I can see that you would accidentally snap your finger, unless you have them sticking into the entrance.  Getting it to lock  can be a little tricky, you really do have to move the lever down slowly.I think the secret to these traps is the mouse has only one way to approach the bait, so he goes down the little hallway and is lined up head-first and SNAP!, no more mouse.  I've caught two mice in the same night with the same bait.Update 09/2012:  I've been through a few of these traps over the years, sometimes the trap is in a rarely-visted place and the dead mouse gets nasty by the time I find it so I just throw the whole trap away.  I see these traps have gotten cheaper but a couple of the new ones I bought have broken after 1 or 2 uses, a little plastic piece breaks and you can't set the trap.  I tried to fix it using Gorilla Glue but without success.  Hopefully this isn't a trend.
B000P9URDQ We live on a large lot that borders a freeway.  Some years we have trouble with mice in the fall and no longer have any cats.  We used glue traps for years.  Although they work fairly well, you still have to actually kill the mouse once it's trapped.We won't use poisons for several reasons and don't want to use the old fashioned, open snap traps because they present a danger to our small dog and us.I ordered two of these traps, which arrived quickly.  One of them was defective, but the other has proven to be very efficient.  I wish we didn't need it at all, but it works very well and is reusable.You can dispose of the already dead mouse without ever having to touch it and easily reset the trap.
B000P9URDQ So far I have spent $50 on two electronic zapper traps that my mice managed to enter, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) and; $30 on four of these traps which the mice have thus far simply ignored leaving the bait behind (peanut butter) along with some mouse poop left right nearby as an F/U to me letting me know they were there and that they weren't falling for my traps.My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got the expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by these which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.I gave it two stars instead of one because they appear well made for the money and I still think they look likely to do the trick if your mice are of the low IQ variety.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the zappers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this if they ever come through.UPDATE: A month and a half into this one of the D-Con's came through and I got a mouse using peanut butter.  Bumped these up to three stars.  Only three because I still have mice...Update#2: These traps = 4 kills - Zapper traps = 2 kills. I appear to be mouse free now. Cats are fired!
B000P9URDQ I bought two of these traps, and the first night, I caught a mouse.  I also purchased two other types of traps for comparison, and think I will continue to purchase these when I need to.  I love that you can set these with one hand.  When the mouse is caught, you don't have to see it, just lift up the flap, and push the lever to release the mouse into the garbage.  Then it is really easy to reset.  I am really excited to catch another mouse now!  Sadly it's been two weeks since I caught the first mouse, and I am beginning to think I only had one mouse. I highly doubt that, but I will be grateful if I only have one.
B000P9URDQ I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from \"set\" to \"caught.\" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice.
B000P9URDQ The hook that holds the metal bar in place doesn't work on mine. I know that if I didn't have a defective trap, it would have probably worked... but who knows with my mouse. It's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps. I was hoping this would do the trick, as I've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings, no matter how small and it seems to be working. I guess I'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen. I don't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I can't get to and I don't want it's dead body stinking up my house.
B000P9URDQ I hate the idea that I have no choice than to kill, I tried the humane way for 5 years, but they are overunning my house, since I have chickens and mice are attracked to the feed etc.I bought several different types and the mice beat the trap and got away with the goods.  Not with this trap, I put it under the sink with some cheese I had left over and within ONE HOUR, no joke, I had a mouse, I was a little taken back to see his little legs and tail sticking out but I am sure he could not have suffered since this thing is quick.I will buy several more tomorrow now I can put them everywhere not being afraid it would hurt my dig or cat, yes I have a lazy cat. I had a terrier that brought me  mice on a regualr basis, she is gone now, guess that is why I have a problem.It is Oct.09 now and I am mouse free, I found their exit from the attic where they were making a home and making lots of noice. I placed the traps in their path under the sink.  This trap caught 14 mice in less than 2 weeks.  Unfortunately one was not killed and I feel bad about that, but he was not really hurt because he ran off outside. I also found a few in the garage.  Funny thing when you scare them away as long as you keep the traps open they will be afraid to come back, I think it is that way.
B000PBXESO With this feeder hanging outside my office window, I see hummers feeding on it all day long. It's easy to fill and hang, easy to take apart and clean, and the hummers can't get enough.Living in the southwest desert, the hummers around here have a particularly hard time finding fresh nectar sources throughout the year. It gets so hot here in the summer that the nectar in hummingbird feeders either ferments or completely dries up within 5-7 days. The feeders here need to be cleaned and filled with fresh nectar twice a week.With this feeder it's easy and painless to take down, clean and refill.The hanging hardware works well, everything seems to be fairly durable.I'm planning on ordering a second one soon, I could not be happier with the one I have.
B000PBXESO I bought 2 hummingbird feeders at the same time since the little cuties can be so aggressive. I bought 2 different brands. This one was my favorite at first as I liked the way it looked. However, its not going to hold up. The metal ring at the top is not attached in any way and the nectar bottle will fall through from time to time even though I don't even fill it half way. This has caused the plastic \"bowl\" at the bottom to break. This red plastic nectar holder is actually in 2 parts. One of the two pieces has broken slightly from all the falls to the ground. It is holding up for now...but will probably need to get tossed at the end of this season.If you're curious, the other feeder I purchased was this one: It is holding up much better...B00004RA8P
B000PBZFJK I have 3 feeders hanging on my deck - this is the &#34;go to&#34; one.  I don't know why, but I guess &#34;pretty&#34; has nothing to do with their choice!  Easy to clean, assemble.  No drips or spills.
B000PBZFJK These feeders are very well designed. I have 3 Best-1 feeders hanging outside my office window, I see hummers on them all day long. The feeders are easy to disassemble and clean, seem relatively durable (unless you drop them), and most importantly the hummers love them.I originally ordered and have been using the larger version of this feeder, theBest-1 32oz. Hummingbird Feeder. I was so happy with it that I decided to order two more.After trying the large 32oz. version I decided to go for the smaller 8oz. version, mainly because it gets so hot in the summer where I live. If I put the 32oz. feeder out full of nectar, it will ferment and go bad in just a few days, before the hummers can drink it all. The 8oz. version is exactly the same product but with a smaller bottle attached. The bases look identical and are the same size.The small bottle on the 8oz. version is easier to unscrew from the base, easier to clean, the hummers drink most or all of the nectar before it goes bad, and it's easier to see how much nectar is left in it.If you live in a cooler climate then the 32oz. version is probably a better choice because you can fill it up and leave it out longer, but if you live somewhere that gets hot enough that you have to change the nectar several times a week like I do, then these 8oz. bottles are the way to go.The hummers here in the southwest desert have a hard time finding fresh nectar in the summer, so it's really fun to set up a little sanctuary for them. These feeders are perfect for it.Hummingbird Nectar Mix======================For the nectar mix I am using 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, boiled then cooled. One drop of trace minerals added after the mix is cool. A great trace mineral to use isLiqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle.
B000PBZFJK Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
B000PBZFJK I buy hummingbird feeders locally whenever there are end of season sales.  Six or seven hang out in our very large yard at any given time; we've gone through many different styles and brands.  Best-1 hummingbird feeders have held up the longest (7+ years) and seem to be the hummingbirds' favorite.  As a matter of fact, the only time one failed is when a raccoon tried to drink out of one, the feeder fell, and the glass bottle broke.  With any other, you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  No problem here--replacement parts are made and sold.These feeders can be found elsewhere at cheaper prices, and replacements for either the glass top or plastic bottom can be bought separately.  Look up Nottawa Wild Bird Supply (can be found online) in Indiana.  They sell this 8 oz. feeder for $8, the base replacement for $5, or the 8 oz. glass top for $3.  I stop in whenever I'm in the area--it's a birder's paradise.
B000PBZFJK The bottle is glass and I like that because glass clean easier than plastic.Haven't used it yet, but I like it because it's small and I got two of them so hummers have more to choose from
B000PGOON8 Given the cost of this unit, the water reservoir capacity, and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots, I think I'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I'm going to be out of town for a week or more.
B000PGOON8 The instructions that come with the CobraCo Plant Sitter are terrible.  In order to make this product work, you must (1) fill the container with water (nothing else mixed in), (2) wet the ceramic cone, (3) fill the ceramic cone with water, (4) make sure the plastic tubing is at the bottom of the water container, (4) start the siphoning process, and (5) put the ceramic cone in the dirt up to the cap.The container is made for small rimmed pots only.  If you have a larger rimmed pot, you'll have to improvise or put the water container inside your pot.  The problem with putting the container inside of your pot is that the water will siphon out quicker than if hanging on the pot, so you'll need to monitor your plant to see if it is getting too much water.  The container is see-through, so you can eye-ball the water level easily, but it is made of plastic, so time will tell how durable it is.Overall, not a bad product.  An adjustable hanger would have been nice to have in order to use the system on different types of pots.
B000PGOON8 I tried this while out of town for six days and it did not seem to work. The soil was dry when I got back even though the plastic container was still full of water.Other reviewers have left tips that I should try. Maybe then it would work. But the system should work more simply than that; it is basically a water container and a wick. And it is not good-looking although it is not real ugly either.
B000PGOON8 The concept is a good one, however, it's a little bulky and ugly and will only work on certain pots.  The system is too big to work on anything less than 8\" tall.  If you have a decorative pot that has a thick rim (over 1\") or overly curved, this will not fit.  I would use this for plants if I was going to be away for a few weeks, but it isn't attractive enough to have on my pots year round.
B000PGOON8 I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the \"hose\" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire \"hose\" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say \"manufactured in\". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away.
B000PGOON8 I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter. The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless, leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work. It seems simple enough. Fill the reservoir with water, connect the hose, and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it isn't that simple. The water doesn't seem to flow on its own. I have tried several things, from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to \"prime\" the tubing with water, but nothing seems to work. I did read that there is a way to get it to work, but I had already given up at that point. It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant, that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I can't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work, and so apparently it isn't totally worthless. But for wasting my time, and frustrating me, I will give it 2 stars. I should also mention this thing is ugly and won't clip on to pots that have a thick rim, like some ceramic pots. It is also made of very cheap plastic, not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products. Overall, this thing is not good and I do not recommend it.
B000PGOON8 As many have said, the lid will not stay shut which can impact the suction through the hose.  It is ok, but I believe that they could have made a higher quality version and charged more as there seems to be good demand for such a product.
B000PGOON8 I have to say that this little thing has worked wonderfully for me. I have read that it does not work for bigger plants but that works out for me since the one I use it on is a smaller one. It is very easy to use although you may have to figure it out yourself since some have had trouble with the instructions. Luckily everything was fine for me and this thing works. I am away from home a lot so this really works out well for me. I recommend this to any one with a plant in need.
B000PGOON8 I held great hopes for this gadget.  We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk, containing a brugmansia.  We needed a plant there to shade the window, but it's a hassle keeping it watered. Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately, it didn't work for this purpose.  The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed, so perhaps that's part of the problem.  Also, the curve of the plastic container wasn't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size.  I tried sitting the container on the ground, though, and that didn't improve the function.Judging from another review here, I might be able to use the wired device in another container. But right now I don't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions. Very clear.
B000PGOON8 This watering system only fits on medium/large sized pots, and I wouldn't recommend it for use as your sole watering system. However I have a bad habit of only watering my plants every few days, and this has worked well to pick up the slack in between.The design concept is interesting and quite functional, however the materials used are not particularly high quality. It would be a better use of money to create your own reservoir and purchase water sensors from CobraCo (CobraCo 6001-TC Replacement Ceramic Watering Sensors) or another company.
B000PGOON8 FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, if you do that and pre-soak the ceramic spike, then fill the spike and the tank with water this system will work VERY well. I've been using the ceramic spike for years now and they have never failed me. Now they're just bundling the spikes with a water tank, which is convenient. This tank is probably only good for a few weeks with most plants, but you can use a bigger tank if needed. I've used up to a gallon tank without a problem.
B000PGOON8 I'm not the world's best organized as far as remembering to water my plants, so this plant sitter is ideal. I have it \"sitting\" a plant that's perched up on a high credenza in my office that I have to get up on a stool to water--- hence it sometimes gets missed. With the sitter I don't have to worry about it anymore--- I can see clearly from the tank when I need to replenish its water. Very handy for me and very pleased to have it.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter is a product designed for those who'd like to have their plants watered automatically over a period of time. It contains a reservoir for the water and a ceramic sensor to trigger water release when the soil gets dry. You will need to carefully follow the instructions and test-run it to make sure it is properly watering your plants. Some users need to make adjustments to get it working sufficiently, such as changing the position of the reservoir, taping the lid closed, adjusting the sensor insertion spot, etc. It has a decent cosmetic appearance and hangs easily on most plant containers - I have a variety of potted plants on my patio and it fits a majority of them. It seems to usually work well when used as directed but there are exceptions and if you expect it to work fine for every plant and without any adjustment then you could have it ruin a plant. The mechanism for how this functions is simple enough that someone could create a similar system on their own using parts that are less expensive. Thus, if you have a lot of plants that need automatic watering it would be expensive to buy a lot of Plant Sitter packages - you'd probably want to find a more inexpensive system. Thus, I'd say this is an option for those with no more than a few plants that may need watering when there's temporarily no human around to do the job - and you should first test run it when you are around to ensure it is functioning as intended.
B000PGOON8 This arrived just as I was about to leave for four days, and the plant I most wanted to save was an outdoor potted plant. I knew this was not made for outdoor plants, but I figured I'd try anyway. That was a useless effort; I came back to find the tank completely dry and the plant dry, too... I guess the tank just evaporates easily in hot weather.Anyway, then I tried it for its intended use. I placed it in a small potted houseplant and it has watered for 7 days-- the soil is nice and moist and the tank is about halfway down, just as the literature says (up to 2 weeks of watering).PROS:-Works as intended-Camouflaged colors-- the green blends in with the plant, so it's not a big, obvious device-You can use it with your own water container, too, if you want something bigger (as long as the hose reaches the bottom)CONS:-Expensive. How many people have just one houseplant they want to save? At this price, you could rack up triple digit expenses just to keep your plants watered.-The top doesn't stay closed. You'd expect there to be a tab or something to keep it \"clicked\" closed, but nope. It just sits there. My cat hasn't knocked it over yet, but it's just a matter of time, I think.-Doesn't fit \"almost all\" containers as advertised. I've tried it on several small containers, and it doesn't stay on them. Not a big deal in my case, though, because my plants are on a countertop and I've just put the tank behind the plant instead of hanging from the side of the pot. Also won't work for hanging plants-- it tipped mine sideways from the weight.Overall: if you have just one or two indoor plants you really want to save while you're away, this could work well.
B000PGOON8 2nd UPDATE:The sensor was empty today. I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened. Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I've been using for years still have water in them, there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter. I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I've used for years. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know for sure, all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:After setting this system up using 3 sensors (one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned), I thought everything was working normally. After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water. I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again. The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they're supposed to be. I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water. I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again. If so, I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years. I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir.  The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors:~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe  10-15 minutes in water (Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions)~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil. I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water.  To feed  your plants, add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making  sure it rests on the bottom. (For the Cobra Plant Sitter, drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir's lid)~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water won't evaporate & so mosquitoes won't get in if you're using it outside. (The Plant Sitter has a lid, but the lid doesn't snap closed. To keep the lid closed, I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir. If I was using the Plant Sitter outside, I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil)~IMPORTANT: Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it's working properly. (I noticed that the water level in the reservoir hadn't changed in a week. I pulled the ceramic sensor out, removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty...that's why it wasn't working. I filled it back up, put the cap back on, pushed the sensor back into the soil; by the end of the day, the reservoir's water level was going down)...see my UPDATEA few tips:~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type, size & season, a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly. I find that for my plant in a 6\" pot, the Plant Sitter's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants, you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor. Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water, you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter's reservoir is a nice translucent color, not flashy or showy, so it won't detract from your plant. It's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants. So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time. The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it, but I had to put the other tube under the lid; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed. I'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled  often, but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I haven't been watering them enough. I'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon's product description is confusing to me. It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir. I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product, but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product's label instructions & the lid doesn't snap closed.~~~~~~~~
B000PGOON8 This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to \"prime the pump\" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a \"sensor\") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the \"sensor\" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12\" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week.
B000PGOON8 I tried this in my guest room, where I have a few plants that get forgotten. After following the directions, I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant. It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system didn't work well. A month after installing, there was still water in the well. The plant was very droopy. I'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results.
B000PGOON8 I am evaluating this product winter 2013 when indoor environment is extremely dry. The houseplant sits facing Southern window connected with the watering system. Instructions are so easy to follow. I fill the reservoir and ceramic sensor with luke-warm water. The system does the watering for me. In about two weeks, I re-fill the reservoir.One more thing about the watering system is that it may take a while to \"calibrate\" the system. If you notice that the water level in the reservoir does not go down, the system is not properly calibrated. Simply refill the ceramic sensor. Repeat the process if necessary.
B000PGOON8 I was excited for the Plant Sitter to work, but alas, it must have gotten distracted and focused on playing on its cell phone when it should have been tending to the plant. Alas, so hard to find good sitters these days. :)Really, though, it's a good idea, but just didn't work for us. Maybe it was operator error, but the thing really didn't come with a lot of instructions.We placed in to tend a tomato plant that we had in a pot about 14\" in diameter.As we checked on it, it seemed that the water level in the Plant Sitter container was going down, so it seems like it was watering, but it just wasn't watering enough, and the tomato plant really struggled.This may be the type of Sitter that needs a watchful eye, but then, what's the point?It could be used as a backup for watering if you're prone to forget to water everyone once and a while, but as a main source for watering on a long vacation, I'd think twice about, unless you test it really well before you leave and are confident that it provides enough water for the size of planter you have.
B000PGOON8 When I was first offered this product for review, I thought \"What a great concept!\" Since I live in a condo and do container gardening outside, I decided to give this product the ultimate test by using it on the container for one of my tomato plants. It stayed there all summer and into the early fall.First off, you're supposed to soak the ceramic piece that's going to go into the soil in water. I totally didn't see that part of the instructions at the time, so that clearly could have impacted the plant sitter's performance that first week or so.  You then put the ceramic piece into the soil and put the long thin tube that is connected to it down into the plant sitter water well that hangs on the side of your plant's pot. Super simple and quick to install.The first problem I encountered is that the LID of the water well would not stay shut. This may not have been a problem if I'd been using it for an INDOOR plant, but it certainly was a problem with an outdoor plant, because all the bugs, dirt and other detritus that swirls around the parking lot of my condo could go right into the water. Over time, even if I occasionally poured out the old water and put new in, a green gunk grew on the inside bottom of the water well. I can't say exactly how much this impacted the plant sitter's ability to keep my plant watered, but I suspect it clogged up the tube somewhat.The end result was that, when comparing my two tomato plants in exactly the same containers with exactly the same type and amount of soil, the plant with the plant sitter generally needed less watering. HOWEVER, in no way would I have been able to rely on the plant sitter SOLELY to water my tomato plant, so I still watered with the hose when necessary (especially during that part of our summer that was over 100 degrees). I could see a small to medium house plant that didn't have a great need for water being able to survive over the long haul with this plant watering system, but not a large plant and not likely one (like my Spathiphillum) that constantly droops unless it is well and regularly watered.I would definitely get another plant sitter for an indoor house plant IF the company could fix the lid problem. The fact that the lid refused to latch and stay shut was a constant annoyance to me this summer...and trust me, I tried many times to get it to latch. I think I succeeded ONE TIME out of an entire summer of tending to my tomato plants...but it didn't stay closed for long.In summary, this plant sitter is a GREAT concept for those who want to have plants but travel often and don't want to pay someone to water their plants while they're gone. It is easy to set up and easy to use. If it hadn't been for the lid issue, I would have happily given this product 4 stars.
B000PGOON8 Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, \"Why not?  I'll give it a try,\" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive.  I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first.  That kind of takes away the \"automatic\" idea.  Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.  I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product.  I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations.
B000PGOON8 This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know.
B000PGOON8 The COBRA 6000 PLANT SITTER works OK for what it is, however, the company didnt print the correct instructions for its use. You will NOT get any water moving into the watering stake, unless you syphon the water thru that hose. The instructions only mention filling up the stake with water. So, first fill up the water tank. DO NOT ADD ANY FERTILIZER. (You dont want to get that in your mouth.) Next, twist off the cap over the watering stake, and fill it up with water, RIGHT TO THE BRIM. Then, CAREFULLY put the cap back on. Now, SYPHON the water thru the hose, and when its flowing, then attach the hose to the plant stake. Place the plant stake as close to the roots as you can get it, without damaging them. Lastly, either hang the tank on the side of the planter, or place it ABOVE the plant's soil level, so you get good water flow. The hose's opening should ALWAYS be at the BOTTOM of the tank. The instructions remind you NEVER to let the tank run out of water, or let the water lever fall too low inside the watering stake. If you do, the syphoning suction will break down, and you'll have to initiate the syphoning process again.DOES THE COBRA 6000 WORK? Its OK, tho other self watering systems I've seen, use TWO of these watering stakes per planter. Unless you have a SMALL plant, just one stake wont moisten all the dirt in your planter, to the detriment of some of your roots. Also, the water tank is designed to attach to the side of a planter. However, its TOO BIG for that to work, unless you have at least a one gallon sized planter. It claims to water a plant UP TO 3 WEEKS. I guess they mean a cactus. I found the water tank to run out, after about 7-10 days.BEST METHOD FOR KEEPING YOUR PLANTS WATERED DURING VACATION.1. WATER THE PLANTS THOROUGHLY before you leave.2. COVER THE DIRT WITH WET PAPER TOWELS, or wet rags. Then, cover over the planter with a plastic bag. This will hold a LOT of water inside your planter. For outdoor plants, skip the plastic bag, cos you'll want to get whatever rain you can inside the planter.3. PLACE HUMIDITY TRAYS NEAR THE PLANTERS. Lack of humidity will cause extra evaperation thru the leaves.4. DONT PLACE IN DIRECT SUN. You'll want to get your plant to go almost into hibernation, while you're away.5. USE A WATERING SYSTEM LIKE COBRA 6000. I've seen people take a 1 liter plastic bottle, fill it with water, plug it with a rag, and place it upside down inside the planter. The water will slowly drain thru the dirt. This is good for BIG pots, and plants that like wet feet, like tropicals. The COBRA 6000 is a sophisticated version of that same method of watering, that works well for small planters.Overall, the COBRA 6000 works, but only on a smaller plant. If the plant is too big, the stake cant get water thru the WHOLE root system. Rememeber, to syphon the hose before use, make sure the opening is placed on the bottom of the tank. Also, keep the stake filled with water too. Best results were optained from placing the tank ABOVE the planter's rim, not hooked on the planter's side. If you place the water tank upon the rim, as the drawing on the cardboard container suggests, the weight of the filled tank might tip over the planter. Also, its less likely to work well, as the tank drains.Overall, a cheaper alternative to the more expensive, multi-pot watering systems. However, the vague, incomplete instructions, and the watering tank that's designed too large to hang on the planter's rim, might spoil this product for some.
B000PSFLT2 While I tried to swear off any more awful Chinese plastic hose accessories, favoring far better US brass stuff when available (not often), this was the only configuration that would work for my irrigation system without redoing the whole thing. Cheap and with a lot of optional ways to hook up stuff, and the shut-off valves are very handy.Although plastic threads usually fail after awhile, this device seems well-made with decently formed threads, a brace kit useful for some installations, an upper brass coupling and the valves work smoothly and are big enough to operate fairly easily.I had to take off a star because a somewhat similar, and discontinued, Orbit manifold sprung a leak right in the middle of the body and sometimes guilt by association is hard to deny.
B000PSFLT2 Plastic Manifold has Brass Coupler, 2 plastic End Caps, and 3 plastic Ball Valves for a total of 1 entry and 5 exits to the manifold.Ball Valves work smoothly and shut off completely.Manifold comes with a steel brace, mounting screws,  and instructions.To avoid the extra work of drilling holes in the block wall, I didn't use the enclosed steel brace. Instead, I measured the installed length of the Manifold to the ground at the intersection of the wall -- cut a length of White Schedule 40 PVC to fit, and have an easily-removable brace that's a plenty strong.I mounted a RainBird Pressure Gauge on the center valve -- an Orbit Digital Timer on the right that feeds a RainBird Gear-Drive Sprinkler -- and a 37' hose with a Bel-Aire Nozzle on the 3rd port for durability and versatility.All this behind a Valterra A01-1122VP High Flow, 55-lb Lead-Free Pressure Regulator -- ALL available here at Amazon.My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!
B000PSFLT2 I bought this to hook up a hose and two sprinklers at the same time, so I don't have to constantly switch hoses depending on which item needs use currently. Works great, made it through the first year. Each hose outlet has a on/off control valve which it's good. You probably won't be able to run 3 items at one time unless you have great water pressure in your home - or if they run just fine at low pressure. I definitely recommend bringing it in over the winter so it doesn't crack and leak. I've had two Gilmour two-way splitters before and they only lasted one year before they started leaking, however I didn't bring them in for the winter - so that may be the cause.
B000PSFLT2 I have this set up with two soaker hoses at either end.  Since they are so light, there is no need for me to use the anchor that came with the product.  For my needs, this product is just right!
B000PSFLT2 I have two of these, they are both working very well. I am very pleased with them and will buy more if the need arises.
B000PSFLT2 This was easy to hook up and is a life-saver now that I am trying my hand at landscaping and have several hoses going all over the yard. My only complaint is that it sometimes leaks, but I'm not sure if that's an error on my part or if it's the product itself. I also think that the hoses sometimes get stretched (as in, pulled slightly away from this product when they're in use), so the seal isn't as tight as it should be. It's easily fixed.Also, sometimes, for the same reason as above--stretching of hoses as they're used--the gold part on the top (that attaches to the main faucet) unscrews a bit and starts leaking. But you just have to twist it back on tight and again, probably only happens because the hose is being stretched.
B000PSFLT2 Kind of a cute little gadget and does serve a purpose. The supporting arm provided was useless so have to invent one of my own.. It sure makes it convenient to have several hoses at the ready and don't have to mess around disconnecting  and re connecting to change hoses
B000PSFLT2 The Orbit 3-way faucet valve is absolutely great so far. One or two reviewers almost scared me off by saying you should get the metal one instead, but I had a metal 2-way faucet valve and hated it. It leaked, it was too hard to turn the dials and it was surprisingly insubstantial for metal.This faucet valve comes with a brace you can attach to the back to bear some of the weight of the hoses, but I didn't attach it and I don't think I need to. Everything is tight and sturdy as can be. Maybe the angle of my faucet coming out of the wall makes it unnecessary to have a brace. After my experience with my last 2-way faucet valve I bought some washers for this one, but I haven't needed them at all. Not a drop of escaped water. I run a hose to one garden, a hose to a second garden in the opposite direction, and a hose across the yard to a dog pen. I had forgotten that sometimes I need water at the faucet for other things as well and was thinking about getting a 4-way faucet, when I realized the end cap screws off and there is your 4th outlet, and even a fifth one on the other side.I love this thing. It has solved so many problems for me. And again, it's sturdy! Nothing moves when I yank on one of the hoses. What a difference from my \"better\" metal one!Update -One month of constant use later: This connector has had a workout. Everything still works smoothly. I guess that is what impresses me most after having struggled with a brass connector. The individual dials turn sooo easily and when they are off, there is no leakage. This whole thing is so well made.Another update -One year later I am having to buy another one. I think the couple of deep freezes we had this winter did it in. But the price makes it painless to replace.
B000Q5S7RM I had an issue with my order that the seller resolved immediately, so I won't detail that.Once my worms arrived I opened them up and gave them some water before placing into the soil.  The box was a lot smaller than I anticipated; I was envisioning 4-6 inch long fat worms in a box the size of a gallon jug or bigger.  The box was about 8\" square, and the worms were TINY- average was an inch, inch and a half long.  But I've no doubt there was 1000 in there.  Once it warms up in SoCal I'll be buying several more boxes for my garden.
B000Q5S7RM Arrived on time and included a bunch of live red wigglers.  I didn't see any dead worms and my worms have been thriving in my composter.  They also started mating right away... I don't know if that's a sign of adjustment or not but they do seem to be very happy worms.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B000Q5S7RM I bought these because I am having a problem in part of my lawn with compaction.  I have some heavy clay under my soil.  I have aerated my lawn, but it just need some more help.They arrived packed well, and had a cooling pack to keep them from getting too hot.  They also included a sheet of instructions which I highly recommend you read before putting them out.  I did not find any dead worms.  In the instructions and FAQ with this company they stated that the worms may seem a little thin from being dehydrated from shipping, but mine were fat and healthy.I followed the instructions and put them out in one spot and covered them with damp newsprint, after loosening up the soil (I used a pitch fork).  They started wriggling down into the soil right away.  I checked the next day under the newsprint and did not see a one, so I am sure they are happy underground,  and I am looking forward to them helping my lawn.
B000Q5S7RM I'm trying to think of something to say about a bag of worms.  They're worms, right?First of all, there were several dead ones.  Of course I didn't count them, but there were enough to notice the difference between the moving worms and the motionless/limp/lifeless ones.  I guess some perishing in transit might be normal, I don't know.Second, there were some critters other than worms.  Some of them look like miniature centipedes, others are just little wiggly things.  I guess it's inevitable that you'll have supplemental detritus-eaters, but actually I was expecting only worms.Hopefully these are the last worms I'll ever buy.
B000QD7MZ2 This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
B000QD7MZ2 PROS- large size, individual perches, easy to hang bailCONS- all plastic, including the nectar bottleThe main advantage of this model is its large size, so if you have lots of hummer activity, you won't run out as fast.  Also, being plastic, it doesn't weigh as much as those with glass bottles, though of course once you fill it with a larger amount of nectar it weighs more.However, I do wonder if some of the plastic from the bottle is getting into the nectar.  We try to avoid plastic packaging in our house, what is this plastic doing to the hummers.  Also, I wonder if the clear plastic bottle will discolor or scuff from cleaning over time, in a way that glass wouldn't.The bail (hanging loop) is larger and easier to manipulate than on other hummingbird feeders I have, but it still gets in the way of standing the bottle up straight when filling it.  If they had made it just a bit larger, or designed the plastic bottle to have some recesses in it for the bail, then the bottle could stand up straight when needed.
B000QD7MZ2 I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me.
B000QD7MZ2 I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000QD7MZ2 I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it doesn't leak. I don't really expect this to last more than this season. Don't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and don't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste. If you don't need that much just fill it half full. You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts. If they aren't on right they will just fall off so you'll know if you did it right or not. The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder. Just take your time putting these features on so you don't break them.UPDATE: The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off. The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely. Now there is an opening large enough for any bird, fly, wasp, etc. to get into the juice. Not a good thing. When this is empty I won't use it again. Spend more and get a nice glass feeder, they are the best.
B000QD7MZ2 This has been a great year for the hummers in our yard.  Have two nests, each with two eggs and a source of pleasure just watching.  The one feeder that we have had just doesn't hold enough and a royal pain to clean.  So glad we were able to get this---it holds plenty of our \"nectar\" and refills a lot less often, very easy to clean.  The really great feature is that this holds 48oz of nectar.....enough to last more than a day!  After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop----I'm thinking the hummers agree!  A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space.**May 17, 2014  This update is an unhappy one! Our huge feeder now has a leak underneath, along the bottom of the base...what a mess!  We had it hanging in a tree and thought that the wind was causing the feeder to sway too much, losing all of the solution.  We decided to place it on a stable post to correct the problem...wrong!  The plastic base piece is open for easy cleaning, but actually consists of two attached pieces that do not make a good seal .  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet concerning this flaw in design.  Hopefully, the company will soon address this issue, and figure out a way to make a bottom piece that is solid. but easy to clean.  This also applies to the models that have two separate bottom pieces that Really Leak!  We like Perky-Pet products, and hope that the solution to the leaking problems will be soon!
B000QD7MZ2 This hummingbird feeder does its job. It's much larger than many others on the market- 48 oz. Its constructed of plastic, but seems relatively sturdy. Other people have had problems with leaks, but I haven't experienced any after 2 months of use; (if any do develop I'll update the review). One thing to keep in mind for first time hummingbird feeder buyers is that you have to buy special food so that the hummingbirds don't starve to death on sugar water. They need nutrients, and it's only fair for you to know that ordering this feeder won't be everything you need to get up and running.It's easy enough to clean, although for people like me who don't like to take the time to disassemble, clean and dry multiple parts it's not fun. I'm not aware of any alternatives, just something to keep in mind because I'll either make the effort to pull apart and hand wash my juicer or the birds', but not both. Only one of us will get our nectar!
B000QD7MZ2 There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B000QD7MZ2 This is not your typical Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder simply because our hummers avoid it often.  Even after setting out fresh food along with the other Perky-Pet models, they only visit this feeder when the other 4 are busy with birds.It should be the center feeder with all of its features attractive to birds and old geezers.  The birds voted with their feeding habits and have said they are not too interested.  The humans like a large, 48 ounces in this case, feeder; however, unless a large eating population has arrived the 220 (this one) goes stale.  We probably refill more often than necessary, but, I'd rather do that, especially in the beginning of the season, to encourage their eating at our stations.  The 220 has 6 'seats' for the birds and when you watch them, they will sit there, socialize and eat for a short time and then begin a fight with the arrival of the Alpha Hummer.The top has a built in moat and that is a nice feature since it does keep out the ants but not the wasps.  There is nothing that I know of that will eliminate wasps, but do we want to?  The hummers do not seem to care.  They just go to another feeder.  I do not care for the plastic feeding tube.  On the first two refills, it leaked and it was my fault for not tightening the bottom to the tube tightly.  Because it is a light plastic tube, the wind blows it easily and in doing so the food comes out of the holes.If the birds begin enjoying this feeder similar to the other ones, I will edit this and make necessary changes.  Of course, there may be reasons to downgrade it also.
B000QD7MZ2 This just came today in time for hummer season this year. Anxious to see how well it holds the large about of feed that it is rated for. The lid seems a little wonky to screw on, so we shall see. I expect this to last about one season with the critter activity we have here. Went together fairly easily and should provide a lot of feeding stations for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 This feeder is great.  It is easy to clean.  No more sticking something down inside it try to clean stuff out.  The base does not come apart but there is plenty of room for a dish brush or cloth to get in there and clean.  I was slightly disappointed that the nectar holding part is plastic.  For some reason I thought it would be glass.  We will see how it holds up in the weather but so far so good.
B000QD7MZ2 We have another Hummingbird feeder with small perches, and we've found that Hummingbirdsdo use the perches, and in doing so allows us to watch them longer.This large and roomy Hummingbird feeder is 25\" around the base (7 3/4\" dia) which allows ample roomfor the birds to share six feeding ports, which is nice since Humming birds are rather territorial.It's well made, and the plastic of the six perches are flexible, durable, and are a nice large size (1 1/2\" wide)The feeder doesn't come with instructions how to put it together, however, it's obvious how it belongs.Except for the yellow buttons which took a second glance to understand they snap in rounded side up.The 6 buttons and 6 flowers are quite firm to snap together, but the flowers easily pull out to clean.And the yellow centers punch out easily with a slotted screwdriver.A very nice 48 oz feede
B000QD7MZ2 I have three different feeders in my backyard and this seems to be the favorite. Sadly, my hummingbirds fight so, at most, I'll get two hummingbirds carefully spaced. Even so, they don't want to go to one of the other feeders but rather fight over this one.They don't share very well, so it's really kind of big since I change the solution regularly.The one thing that really brings this down to three stars for me is that the diameter of the lip of the top that fits into the base is too big. First, the top needs to be inserted, it goes down about a half-inch, and then it is turned and locked into place. I was having a very difficult (and messy) time getting the top to fit. I finally had to shave off some of the rim around the base with a razor. Happy to say that I still have ten fingers.It is easy to clean and I don't have a problem with the vacuum effect that I've had with other feeders.So, it's a five for the hummingbirds and a three for me -- average is four.06/22/2014: I changed my review to a three today. Even though I've tried to shave away some of the plastic on the base, it's still a tight squeeze. Today while trying to maneuver the container onto the base, the whole thing slipped, spewing sugar water all over my kitchen. Now I should also add, \"the ants give it a five.\"
B000QD7MZ2 First let me say we go through A LOT of hummingbird solution. We drain five 48 ounce feeders a day at our house from Mid March through mid July. We also have two pairs that over-winter - so I always have at least one feeder up.I purchased my first Grand Master feeder from Amazon and,when I went to buy more last week I noticed that Amazon is not selling them because of some complaints - or whatever the verbiage was - so I ordered three more from another online source.I have been thrilled with these feeders. They are easier to fill, much easier to clean (you can get your whole hand in the opening) and I no longer need a bottle brush to clean them, plus I am not having to fill quite as frantically as I was because of the larger size. I was so puzzled by the fact that Amazon was not selling them that I started to think of what people might possibly have to say that wasn't good, and this is what I came up with:Most of us, if we use a larger sized hummingbird feeder, are accustomed to using the 32 ounce model that is a bottle with a narrow opening through which you fill the feeder. I used to use a funnel to do so. The bottle sets in the base. When carried outside in the upright position here is always a little leakage as you carry them out to the feeding station but that seems to happen with all of the hummer feeders that I have ever tried. With the 48 ounce feeder, the bottom is much wider; hence no need for a funnel and the ability to make cleaning easier. When you set the bottle back on the base, because of the larger opening there is more leakage. That's the only thing that I can think people might complain about.I have easily solved this issue  ( and used to to do the same thing with the 32 ounce models) by keeping the bottle upside down (standing on the top) after they are filled and replacing the bottom of the feeder (which I always cleaned at the same time as I refilled)  on the top and walking them outside in an upside down manner. Problem solved.For me, with the amount of food I go through, this feeder is such an improvement that I would never complain or return to the 32 ounce feeder, funnel and bottle brush ever again. I love this feeder, and with a bit of common sense it is no more 'drippy' than the smaller sized bottles.
B000QD7MZ2 We love hummingbirds and always put out a feeder or two every year despite the fact that in our x-burban wooded area we don't get that many.  (We still try ;)The feeders I currently have on hand are all PERKY-PET.  I know there are other varieties out there but Perky-pet provides different styles, all at affordable prices.  Right now I have this one (which is the 220), thePerky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder, and our old standby, thePerky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird FeederOut of those three, this is the one I would have rated the lowest, except I have to say that the Hummingbirds really like it.  What I worried about was the base. Since it doesn't come apart I'm going to have to clean it with Q-tips.  This would be a real negative, except for the fact that their Hummers like this feeder.  It has convenient little perches which are set perfectly for feeding.  The birds sit up high enough so that all they need to do is bend over a bit and drink from the plastic flowers.THE GOOD--I prefer glass, but sometimes if children are involved, shatter-proof plastic is better.--Nice handle.--Attractive design.--Hummingbirds love it. We are just getting our first Hummers as I write this and I have to say that they like sitting on the little perches and drinking.THE BAD--Looks like it's going to be difficult to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS--I read all the reviews about leaking. Mine didn't leak. I don't know if Perky-Pet improved the design, but we shook the container, and so far, no leaks.--Unlike the other models I mentioned this one doesn't have threaded glass. Instead it has a 'bayonet' connection.--This thing is HUGE. Unless you live in a locale where you get tons of hummer traffic, I wouldn't suggest you fill this feeder with more than a cup of hummer-chow. The reason is that once it starts getting warm the sugars can get all gross and you should change them out frequently.--Since this feeder is plastic, it might make a good choice if you are going to be letting younger children work with it.SUGGESTIONS--It's best if you don't use the red food. Making your own is super easy, nothing more than mixing 1/4 cup sugar with 1 cup of distilled water. Red dye not needed.--Ants! We hang our feeders off the deck from iron hangers. We keep ants away with vaseline. I have the kids coat the the riser on the road with a heavy slather of vaseline and the ants stay away. Doesn't harm ants or other wildlife.
B000QD7MZ2 I have used a lot of Perky-Pet feeders over the past 20+ years. This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they'd done better on the materials end.
B000QD7MZ2 If you live in an area where you need a large capacity feeder to keep your hummingbirds happy, it's hard to imagine how this feeder would not suit your needs. That said, I did see comments on a review where the person said they have several and are still refilling daily! This feeder was made for those situations, but sadly, those of us that do not have swarms of hummers in their yards will do more dumping of unused juice.Assuming that your situation is the former, and you need 1.5 quarts of juice to keep your hummers happy, you'll find that the plastic cylinder is very easy to clean. It has a wide mouth that makes thorough cleaning a snap. However, the base is nearly impossible to clean properly, as the liquid fills the base, with the recessed areas very hard to reach and clean effectively. If you have any liquid in the cylinder when it comes time to clean, have a place to drain quite a bit of liquid out of the base when you tip it over or take it apart in the sink.In the four weeks that I tested this feeder, I did find that the ruby throated hummingbirds we have here did use it without any issues. Our birds are very territorial, so we never get more than one at a feeder at a time. I was really hoping that the number of ports on this feeder, and the fact that we had six feeders spread around the yard at one time would encourage more birds to be visible at once, but that didn't happen.Just recently, I have found that getting the cylinder to fit into the base is more difficult; almost as if it is going slightly out of round or something. It's not a big deal, as it just takes some patience to put the pieces together.Filling this with 48 ounces of sugar water means that it's going to have some weight, so a sturdy hanger is a necessity. Fortunately, the metal hanger at the top of the cylinder is up to the task. I never had a concern about it breaking and falling, but the shallow clearance requires a proper hook so you don't have to tilt the feeder. An added plus is that the red cap with the hanger screws off the cylinder, which has a flat top, so you can fill the inverted cylinder while it stands on a counter and then screw the top on to hang it. Having these separate parts makes replacements possible as well so heavy users should have some options in that regard.Durability doesn't seem to be a problem, as it was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about three feet, and all that happened was that one of the feeder port flowers popped out. It snapped back in without any trouble, and nothing else cracked or broke as a result of the bouncing it took.Overall, this is too much feeder for many situations. But for those that need the capacity, this is one of the few I've seen that will hold this much juice. While the base is a little unwieldy when it comes to cleaning, I'm not sure there's a better way to build it and still serve six ports with this much juice. If it weren't for the hard-to-clean crevices in the base, I'd give it a solid four stars.
B000QD7MZ2 I've had a few of the Perky Pet feeders over the years, a few of the plastic, a few of the glass - and they all have their pro's and con's.  Aesthetically, I still prefer thePerky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feederseries, but the birds in my area don't seem too attracted to the color (although Perky Pet does offer blue and red versions which might do a better job). The glass bottles just seem to have a little bit of visual impact that allow it to act sort of as a decoration and not just a feeder. These giant 48oz feeders don't try and hide their function - they very boldly proclaim that they are hummingbird feeders.The feeder doesn't really include any useful assembly instructions, but that's not too big a deal as putting it together is pretty elementary. The large reservoir is easy to clean, but you do need a brush (or a really small hand) to get to the very bottom. The perches are very finicky and feel delicate - I'm not really sure how long they'll last. The plastic is also a big question mark. I live in sun country in the middle of Texas, and the harsh sun likes to take out its aggression on plastic. Previous plastic feeders have often cracked or discolored within just a couple of seasons.Another thing to keep in mind, although the large size is nice, unless you're feeding a giant swarm of birds, the nectar will probably \"go bad\" before the birds get to drink it all. In my hot climate, the sugar water molds up within a couple of days or less.All-in-all, I think my next feeder will probably be another glass + metal, but the brilliant red coloration and significant nectar size do make this particular feeder stand out. As long as the plastic parts make an attempt at lasting more than a single season, I'll be pretty ha
B000QD7MZ2 This is a huge capacity plastic feeder that does the job well and attracts hummingbirds quickly.  Where we are, we get mostly Broad-tail hummingbirds.  They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren't used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \"nectar,\" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don't want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn't spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn't leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don't seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.
B000QTMT7W I am relatively new to wood splitting. I have the great Fiskars 36\" splitter, but it couldn't get through a few knotty pieces I have. I hear wedges are good for this, so I got this one.My observations is that it doesn't do great for knotty pieces. It gets in so far, and you give it a good whack, and it bounces out. Looking at the wedge, it doesn't have a gradual grade/increase in angle; about a quarter way up, it broadens really quickly (as you can see). This is, I think, why I was seeing the behavior I was--not enough force (even with a 10lb sledge) to drive it in at that angle for these.I have a theory (and that's all it is for now ;) ), that if I get a more traditional wedge, that will work better for knotty pieces.  This wedge is probably better as an alternative to using a maul/splitter for straight pieces; people say it can split four ways in one go. I will try it for that.  But if you are looking to deal with knotty pieces, I think a standard wedge will probably be better.Again, I'm not very experienced, so take it for what it is worth.UPDATE 29 Dec 2012: I since bought a regular wedge, and I am none too impressed with it. In fact, this one seems better in getting bite so you can really drive it in.  Maybe I am just missing some part of the technique, but the problem is you need to hit it hard enough to get it to bite into the wood, then when you really lay into it for the split, it always bounces out. Seems like it should work better--like driving my splitter into it works great; I just don't want to ruin my splitter.  Will keep looking for the perfect wedge. :)
B000QTMT7W Colin's Wood Splitting Wedge, Diamond Shape, 4 Lbs. Is very good except the point bent a little which keeps me from giving five stars.
B000QTMT7W During the winter (and even this Spring) we occassionally have a fire in the fireplace. I have some huge logs (some 2 feet or more in diameter) from a tree we had cut down two years ago. This really made it easy to split them. Before I was using a flat wedge but this diamond shape is fantastic!
B000QTMT7W Having had a large oak taken down and left with a large pile of 17 - 20\" pieces to chop, I figured a new splitting wedge would make life easier. My old wedge is of similar shape and design but with a blunter tip. For me the new wedge works no better than the old one. Not to say it doesn't work, but that I didn't need to buy a new one.This new wedge is more prone to pop out of the log than the older one and takes quite a bit of effort to drive into the wood with my maul. On one log section, I eventually gave up and attacked the piece with my new Fiskars X27 axe by slicing around the perimeter. As the diameter of the log shrunk, I was able to finally drive in the wedge and crack the remainder of the wood section in half.I have found that putting the wedge in the center of a log section, even one with a crack, doesn't work as well as off-centering the wedge. On less challenging sections of wood, I was able to drive the splitter much more easily and often separate the wood into three pieces.And so this wedge  works fairly well within limits; it's just not the heroic, wonder tool I was hoping for.UPDATE - After more use and experimentation I've found that my much older Oregon splitter is easier to drive, doesn't fly out at me, and works faster. This new splitter has quickly been relegated to reserve status.
B000R0WXI0 I always have weeds on my sandy beach which I pick daily, but want a product to kill them for as long as possible.  This product can take 4 - 7 days to start working.  The bottle says that it will prevent weeds from coming back for up to four months,  my experience has been that it lasts about 6 weeks before I have to start pulling weeds again.  A friend told me to try a brush killer, I am going to give that a try.
B000R0WXI0 We live out in the country where weeds and thorny vines really flourish, so I still use either the Roundup Super Concentrate (purple top) or the Tough Brush Killer (yellow top) for much of our more stubborn vegetation such as blackberry vines, multifloral rose, poison ivy, and saplings.  It just seems to do a better job of getting rid of the difficult stuff.But for sidewalks, flagstone patios and walkways, and driveways, this Roundup Extended Control can't be beat.  When I use the purple or yellow topped Roundup on these areas, I end up having to respray every 3-5 weeks to combat all of the new weeds.  With the Extended Control, I can usually go 2-3 months before spraying again.  The bottle claims that it lasts up to 4 months, but in my experience, it generally wears off before then.  Still, it makes a big difference.  Instead of the 5-6 times that I would normally need to spray these areas during a growing season, I can usually get by with only spraying a couple times a year.Roundup products do take considerably longer to start producing noticeable die-back of weeds.  Many weed killers, such asSpectracide Weed And Grass Killer, wilt the weeds within an hour and leave noticeably dead weed \"leaves\" within 24 hours but have little luck in killing the root.  With the Roundup, I rarely notice any effect at all on the weeds until at least a few days later.  Even then, it's sometimes up to 2 weeks or more before they are fully dead.But, there is a reason for this.  Spectracide uses a an active ingredient called \"diquat\" which kills only the part of the plant that the spray physically touches...in effect, just drying it out so that the leaves and stem die quickly.  Therefore, it doesn't tend to kill the roots and so the weed continues to put forth new growth from the ground.Roundup, on the other hand, uses an active ingredient called \"phosphoenolpyruvate\" which works to destroy the entire \"metabolism\" of a weed and kills the entire plant...including the roots.  For these reasons, I much prefer the Roundup products.  Even though the results are not immediately noticeable, the longer term outcome is much better.Like with the other Roundup products, I mix it up with water in a pump pressure sprayer.  It is supposed to be safe from rain wash-off in 30 minutes.NOTE:  While I use Roundup as my primary weed killer throughout the growing season, I do find it beneficial to keep a container ofSpectracide Weed And Grass Killeron hand.  In late autumn, Roundup isn't usually as effective since it works on the weeds' metabolism...and the weeds are nearly dormant in cooler weather.  In this instance, the \"dry up\" process of the Spectracide works the best in my opinion.
B000R0WXI0 Some here say there's better products out there, and there may be, but this one works pretty darn well for me.  It kills everything I need it to.  I just mix it in a pump sprayer and go!
B000R0WXI0 I've been using another well-known product for years but desired to try this one to see if it was any better. Cost wise it was more economical but did not do everything I would have liked. It works very well on grass and weeds (as long as it is not in a wetland area) but does nothing to small saplings or tough plants like blackberries. I suggest adding a small amount of dish-washing liquid to your sprayer because it helps the liquid to stay on the leaves instead of beading off.
B000RNENU8 Mixed this with some water, and watered my girlfriends plant that keeps lilting in the summer heat.  Boing!  Now, it only needs to be watered once every 4 days to prevent lilting instead of twice a day.  Plus, the leaves are more vibrant and it's reflowering.  Good stuff!
B000RNENU8 I used to use fish emulsion on my garden. I got that tip from working at a garden center when I was in college. People used to buy the stuff like crazy and my mother became a fish emulsion lover because the stuff worked.Fish emulsion is stinky and messy. The stuff is so bad that it can induce vomiting. However, that was then and Miracle-Gro is now.This product works like a charm, is every big as effective a fish emulsion, but without the negatives.Follow the directions as stated on the label, water, and then bask in the compliments. It is just that easy. I prefer the liquid Miracle-Gro because it disperses quickly and is easy to use. There is no mess or unpleasant odor. It works quickly and within the matter of 1 to 2 weeks the results are very noticeable. This is the best plant food ever.
B000RNENU8 I've tried several different plant foods over a period of four decades with my vegetable garden. From everything I can tell, Miracle-Gro is the best in boosting the growth of one's plants. Other brands I've tried have produced less consistently good results. I generally add at the time of planting and follow the directions on the bottle. I would definitely recommend this product for any vegetable or flower garden.
B000RNENU8 Just to state the obvious, perhaps, you are paying for convenience here by getting it in liquid form. If you don't mind digging into the powder bag and getting your fingers a little blue (always happens with me), the granular Miracle-Gro costs about 1/3rd as much for an equal amount of NPK. However, it works great, just like granular Miracle Gro, although I would note that both forms are very short duration (7-14 days), so you might wish to consider a time release product if you have a large yard or garden.
B000RUDBMC It takes time to install and figure out the settings, I am not sure about the long term use, and I will post an update as soon as I notice the results.
B000RUDBMC Love this product! Within 4 days, my yard was poop free. Easy to set up. Seems to work great!
B000RUDBMC You'd think that an animal that relies on its hearing to find its prey would dislike this repeller. But our skunk blithely ignores the thing, goes about his/her business as usual, digging up our lawn in search of grubs. The only time I saw the skunk react, was when I set up the repeller on its usual path into the garden. Unless you have a yard with only one or a few access routes that you can set up one of these each, it's a pretty useless device, IMO. It certainly won't cover thousands of feet as advertised. The skunk simply ignores it!
B000RUDBMC I was hopeful that it would keep the Racoons away from my sweet corn patch. However one of the Racoons leaned up against it while the rest of the family had a feast on my corn. Ya gotta get up pretty early to match wits with a Raccoon. Those critters are smart. They know how to get over an electric fence by the jump and climb method. Playing a Radio constantly to scare them away does not work, they dance to the music and ignore the commercials. I am going to try a laser show next, followed by a motion detector water cannon.  I will let you know if any of this works. It isn't that I love corn, it is the challenge of out witting a Racoonn!
B000RUDBMC I live in the only township in CT that specifically prohibits any harm to the deer. Not surprisingly, they run amok in the neighborhood, destroying prized flowers and carefully grown vegetables with impunity.I have experimented on many remedies over the years. The spay-on repellent washed away too easily and smelled terrible to human too. Last year, I tried Enviro Pro Deer Scram, which lasted longer but was too expensive. I gives this ultrasound noise maker a try this year. It makes a high-pitch screech that is audible to human and therefore quite annoying in the evening, although the family dog does not appear to be too bothered by it. I add aGE 15153 Heavy Duty 24-Hour Mechanical Timerto turn it on from 11pm to 7am because most deer feed in our neighborhood at dawn. So far, our Casablanca Lilly remains unmolested. We will see if it survives the season.
B000RULG8I It is exactly as desribed but my ignorance ofmaterial used  made me have hier expextation. The door is a little flimsy and I use care when using it since I want it to last and not break too soon.
B000RULG8I Mounts easily to the wall. Very sturdy. Well made will last a long time. The hose fits great and it does have a bit of a storage space for other nozzles and things.
B000RULG8I Well built and easy to install. Love the little tuck away compartment with shelf so that you can store your attachments. You really can't ask for much more than that from something so simple. We have two of them and they've held up for a year so far with no signs of wear.
B000RULG8I I liked the fact that it will hold 150' of hose. I recently bought a 120' hose at a warehouse club. My old hose hanger broke within minutes.This hose hanger does the trick. UV protected plastic and a nifty mini-cabinet to store nozzles and the neighbors cat! For those \"up north\" the hanger can be taken down very easily. The hanger holes are key slotted so you can take it in.The plastic is UV protected and nice neutral brownish-beighish color. Remember plastic doesn't rust! Excellent product at this price point.
B000RULG8I Made with durable material (i.e. looks like it will last many years)We have a wide diameter hose that is 100 ft long and the hose fits nicely in this hanger.The storage cabinet offers a great space for small sprayer and provides an attractive look on the front of the house.
B000RUM0R4 My tomatoes were about 2' tall when I decided to cage them. I have been using stakes and ties in the past, but a gardening friend recommended that I cage instead. I received my cage via the Amazon Vine program, so it was risk free. I liked it enough that I purchased 3 additional ones for my other plants.Since my plants were already in the ground, I had to assemble the cage around the plants, which worked fine. The packaging on the product, however, was a little intense...there is a lot of plastic to unwrap and many twist ties. It seemed quite excessive. My plants are in deep planters as I'm in the process of reworking my garden space, so I wasn't able to put the ends in as far as they recommend. This makes the cage a good height. I am uncertain if it would be quite tall enough had I been able to insert the stakes as far as they suggested, though. The product material seems very good and I expect to be able to reuse them for at least 5 years.It loses one star for needing more horizontal support clips to be included in the package (I ended up using the twist ties).Caution to anyone who might be interested in ordering as a present: it came shipped box free, so it was clearly evident what it was.
B000RUM0R4 I ordered this tomatoe cage for my husband. He has a tomotoe garden at the side of our house.  In the past he used wooden stakes and the tomotaoes grew every where.  We wanted more order to the chaos, so decided to order this tomotoe cage.  The plastic is light weight and easy to assemble.  Unlike other reviewers, our tomtoes have not grown very tall so we didn't have to worry about snapping the cage around the tomaotes, but that seems an easy thing to do with this prodcut.  We only ordered one of these and have more tomoatoes plants so did use wooden stakes again so we can see how the cage comapres to the stakes. Like another reviewer I wonder about the height of the cage and support for the plant.  Once the plants start growing, I can come back and do a comparison.
B000RUM0R4 I was delighted with this arrived- it is perfect. Far sturdier than any other tomato cage I have used, and versatile. I grow a wide range of indeterminate heirlooms, and this is perfect. I will be ordering more.
B000RUM0R4 This review is for the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage. The cage is sturdy and provides good support, up to 4.25 feet above ground. Rating 4.5 stars.The cage is made of hard plastic.  Each stake is 5 feet (60\") in height, and 1/4\" thick. One end is slightly pointed and that end gets buried 8\" to 10\" into the ground, leaving slightly more than 4 feet above ground.  The connecting arms are 12\" long, 1/4\" thickness at the center, and 1/8\" thickness at the ends.  The circular ends of the arms snap onto the stakes. The stakes are ridged/textured so the arms don't slide up and down with weight from the plants.  The arms do glide up/down on the arms with a little bit of force in case you need to reposition them.  The stakes are sturdy and barely bend. They seem tough and durable, and are not flimsy.  The arms do bend slightly more than the stakes, but they aren't flimsy either. I would have prefered if the arms were a little bit stronger/thicker to provider stronger support.
B000RUM0R4 I planted tomato seedlings several weeks ago but did not set up the cages.  Last weekend I asked my teen son to help me do it and we pulled out a bunch of the traditional wire cages, along with the one Ultomato Cage, still in its original shipping box.  After wrestling the wire cages over the plants, trying not to break off branches or fruit, and trying to get them to stand straight in the ground, it was a breath of fresh air to break open the packaging of the Ultimato Cage and find out how easy it was to set it up, and set it around the tallest of the plants.  Since the cross bars snap on and off easily, we decided to place most of them low at the moment since the plant is not yet very tall, and we can then move them up as the plant grows, to provide support to new branches.  My son suggested I get more of that type of cage since it is so far superior to the traditional wire cages.  I came inside to try to order more and found that Amazon is not currently stocking them due to shipping difficulties.  This is so disappointing!  I ended up ordering a few more from my local ACE Hardware merchant, but as soon as Amazon has the kinks worked out I will also order more.  Ultimately, I'd like to get rid of all the wire cages and have only these, since the storage at the end of the season will be so much easier with this style of cage.  They may be a little more expensive but to me they are well worth the investment.Update: August 14th, 2013: Unfortunately, since writing my review I have become quite disappointed in the cages.  Admittedly we've had a year of heavy rain, which softened the ground, but these cages are just not holding up the weight of the plants.  Every other day I have to go out and pick them all up off the ground and try to get the stakes into the ground that little bit further so they have a chance of holding.  Now they are in so far that there isn't enough of them left to hold up the plants.  The other problem I've found is that because the bars snap on and off so easily, the weight of the plants is snapping them off, so I keep having to \"rebuild them\".  Perhaps if I try putting them on backwards (i.e. put them on the inside so the plants are leaning against them holding them on, instead of pushing against them?  But that means redoing everything all over again).  One of the cages I purchased came with a set of the bars that is missing the loop at one end so it is useless, and that cage is even weaker as a result of having fewer bars I can use with it.  The bars are also bowing quite a bit.  Just this morning I was thinking I need to google other solutions for next year since I don't think these will be it after all.The traditional metal cages are also falling over - the ground really is very wet - so perhaps in a drier year my experience would have been better.  Sorry....
B000RUM0R4 I'm currently using this to grow cucumbers in a large pot.  This was super easy to put together, and has weathered a few good midwestern storms without incident. It is really ideal for what I am using it for.  I'll update if it has any trouble supporting the weight of the cukes as the summer progresses.  If things stay as is, I won't have any complaints!
B000RUM0R4 Honestly, I love it, and now I regret the time, expense and damage to my poor tomato plants caused by regular metal tomato cages. This apparatus is just like an old-fashioned Tinker-Toy, with sturdy vertical upright poles and horizontal connectors which snap on to them so that the tomato support structure can be arranged, extended and linked to any possible configuration. The best is that it can be installed around established plants, and horizontal supports added as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 We usually make our own homemade tomato cages with cattle fence, which is very difficult to bend. We also found that it is hard to reach through the holes in the cattle fence to pick the large tomatoes, and even some of the small cherry tomatoes that grow inside. This is a much better design than our do it yourself attempt! The Blue Ribbon Ultomato cage holds the plant up, but also has a wide opening so the ripe tomatoes are very easy to reach. If you do need to secure a section a little more it is easy to tie a section to the middle or upper stand (I use garbage bag twist ties). This is a great design and I will soon be replacing all of our homemade cattle fence stands with the Ultomato cages.
B000RUM0R4 The reason I got this product was to get my cucumbers up off the ground, as they tend to take over a lot of territory otherwise.  (See my note below on how I stake my tomatoes.)As stated in some of the other reviews, I agree that the five-foot stakes that come with this product are pretty short, but I love how this design works. The product is designed so that you can place the cross supports anywhere you want.  They don't have to be three in one location as shown in the picture.  If you need to move one cross-support up or down to accommodate a heavier, fruit-bearing branch, just do it.By the way, if you think that that 5-foot stakes will be too short, the stakes that come with this are the same standard green metal rods covered in green plastic that you can buy at any garden center.  So -- if you want more than 4 feet of stake showing above the ground, you can get longer green stakes at a garden center and use the three 5-foot stakes that come with this unit somewhere else.  The cross-supports will clip on the longer stakes in exactly the same way and you'll still be able to adjust them as needed.The bottom line is I love the simplistically clever design.  If you cage tomatoes, these are a good alternative to regular wire cages.  I just wouldn't use them with any plant that gets TOO heavy or has to withstand high winds.  As for my own personal use, this product will work just fine for my cucumbers.**RE: Tomatoes -- After many years of trial and error, I now stake my tomatoes using a single 2x2x8 pounded one-foot deep about 5 or 6 inches from the plant, then pinch off all suckers, tying up the main vine along the stake as the vine grows.  Using the single stake method is, by far, the best I've found for better production on tomato plants.  I also get more plants in less garden space, and it's easier to work around them, too. Cages were always a pain -- falling over with heavy growth, bending in high wind, and breaking.  I learned the single-stake method from a tomato grower who moved here from Romania, and after a bit of online research I learned that commercial tomato growers use similar methods in greenhouses, hanging strings from the greenhouse ceiling.  Because I don't have huge greenhouse, I tried the 2x2x8 single stake method--with great results.  That said, if I was told I had to use a cage, I would choose the Ultomato cage design over traditional wire cages, as the modular design provides greater flexibility to change/adjust the set-up as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for the past four growing seasons and I won't go back.  In the size the come they are great for your typical determinate tomato.  I find that for the big bushy heirloom indeterminate varieties that I like to grow that I need bigger cages.  No problem, I buy a couple and make the cage fit the variety.  Four poles will do for most, but I find using six really gives me room to let the plant spread out.  That allows the plant to dry better and helps reduce fungus problems.  They cost a bit, but they last.  I use a rubber mallet to drive them in, and only loose a few poles a year (out of about 30).  These are so easy to use that I can't ever see myself going back to the old rigid cages.
B000RUM0R4 I'm a long-time gardener who has had to give up the ground game and now must plant in 5-gallon bucket planters (SIPs) on a dirtless back patio. I was really hoping this Ultomato tomato cage would be the answer to my prayer for a structure I could set down inside my bucket planters, then remove and store at the end of the season. Oh, so close...but no cigar. The cross-pieces are just a little too long to allow the vertical rods to stand straight in the bucket, which puts unnecessary tension on the snap-on ends if you try to force it to work. I do hope the Ultomato designers will consider shortening the crosspieces slightly in the future, because this would be a fantastic product for my purposes if they would.Now, that said, I'm going to attempt to plant a bucket planter with the Ultomato just standing on the patio on the outside of the bucket, which does work fine, to see how well it supports a tomato plant once it gets large enough to need the supports. A set of crosspieces can be placed right at the top of the bucket so the bucket itself helps hold the Ultomato up until the tomato grows up into it, then those crosspieces could be moved up to the top. It could be that the weight of the 5-gallon SIP (which I make with gravel in the bottom per Pete Sims' design) will be sufficient to keep the planter itself from blowing over; maybe the Ultomato arranged outside and tied to the bucket won't go anywhere, especially when the tomato gets large enough to press down on the structure and keep it stable.If I don't come back here for an update, you can assume it worked well in the latter case and I'm too busy canning tomatoes to update my review! And, if that is the case, I'm sure I'll get more of these. I'd like to try growing some winter squash on one.
B000RUM0R4 Put mine together today and think this is a terrific idea.  I have quite a few of the large, metal cages that fold flat, but they don't fit in my earthboxes fully expanded.  These will not only fit, but the support can be customized to really provide support where it's needed.I don't buy the cheap, circular wire cages anymore because they don't hold up well, aren't as flexible as square or triangular cages and I prefer supports that fold flat for off-season storage.If a person had several of these cages, the possible configurations and uses are nearly endless.  The poles can be connected and uses to support peas, cucumbers or many other vegetables that need support.My only complaint would be that I think the price is a little high, but the prices are high on all of the decent supports and cages.
B000RUM0R4 While a part of me still wonders if this is significantly better than a tomato cage or even a few well-positioned stakes, I can't deny that it is awesome to have around.  The assembly was easy, and I was amazed at how sturdy it was--I always worried about those flimsy tomato cages flopping over.  No, sir, this one is quite secure and so easy to move around.  This holds a new plant well, but can also be placed around an already existing plant without too much drama.  Good quality and should be appreciated by gardeners.
B000RUM0R4 Update 07/19/2013: Well, the cage has failed. My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage. The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized. One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed. Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants, but so far, so good. These stakes do have some give to them - I've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there. The side support arms are easy to move around, if needed. This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage, unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season. So far, no complaints!
B000RUM0R4 I've been a tomato gardener for 20 years now, and support means everything.  This \"cage\" might be good for a determinate tomato, but for an out of control, constantly growing indeterminate variety, especially with large fruits, this will be useless.First off, this item came ridiculously bubble wrapped, and was extremely frustrating to get undone.  I managed to break off 3 snaps, rendering 3 of the supports useless.  Is that my fault?  Yes, but in my defense, the bubble wrap was so tight and glued, and wasn't easy to open up.The stakes themselves are too short, 5' and \"Strong steel core stakes\" is laughable at best.  These \"Strong steel core stakes\" are the same stakes available at Home Depot, Lowes, or any local nursery, and while they're okay, \"strong\" is not a word I'd use to describe them.  You want strong, get rebar.I ended up putting these \"Strong steel core stakes\" around an obelisk that I am using for my cucumbers, which fit perfectly when I attached the 2 remaining rows of the supports together.
B000RUM0R4 I first bought these &#34;Ultomato Cages&#34; four years ago, after having struggled with multiple other varieties of tomato cages.  I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.
B000RUM0R4 For the price I paid for these I expected them to do very well holding my tomatoes, well they don't.  I expected them to hold the tomatoes up nice and straight, but they sprawl all over the place and have to be attached to the cage.  I don't feel they work any better than wooden stakes or the wire cages and are not worth the price I paid for them.
B000RUM0R4 This seems like a great answer to a number of problems, so I am giving it a 4 star and will wait until Fall to review it again.  The standards are sturdy and substantial.  At five feet, it gives you a good amount to drive into the ground and still have height to use.  The cross-bars are substantial and the clip into place.  They seem like they will gold well, but will have to wait until a full load of tomatoes is hanging on them.  The year end cleanup is what I think will be the best deal.  Normal wire cages bend when trying to remove the old vines and they rust.  This plastic coating should solve the rust problem and having the cage come apart in pieces should make cleanup easier.  I can see getting several seasons out of this while I usually have to replace wire cages every year.  We'll have to see.
B000RUM0R4 I like the design of this tomato cage, simple though it may be. I love that it is versatile and can easily be added to established tomato plants that have already started. It is easy to snap together and install. We did tomato starters this year, but since we've had such a late start in our area our starters have gotten HUGE, so I like the design of this cage, I think it will be easier to use than a regular cage which can't be adjusted.For the price and design, definitely recommended.
B000RUM0R4 I have always used the circular  wire cages that make such a confused mess in your garage all winter, and I won't be able to replace them all (because of cost) but I really kind of like this one.  It is at least as sturdy as what I've been using, easy to use, and \"open\" enough to reach the tomatoes in the middle.I have to say that it is probably taller than a tomato will ever grow in my short season northern garden but hope springs eternal.  If you live in a normal climate I think you will love it.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried SO MANY things to stake my tomatoes. The cheap cages. Bamboo stakes. Bamboo stakes with twine. Triangle cages I thought would do the trick, but still weren't as adjustable as I'd like.But these. These are awesome! You can move the side sections on the fly as you need to which is great. Setup is easy and storage is flat. You can even just use the stakes if you want. This would also work great for lightweight climbers like peas.I LOVE these tomato cages and plan on buying a couple more this year and slowly stocking up on them as the years go by. I think these will last for quite a few years, too, so your investment won't be a one year deal.
B000RUM0R4 This arrived bent. Then, when trying to straighten it out, it broke, but still worked out well enough to work OK. So, it could have been made sturdier.
B000RUM0R4 I was very excited to receive this Gardeners Blue Ribbon Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage.  I am planning on using it when my tomato plants get larger.  But for now it is staking up my raspberry bush.  And doing a great job of it!  This was sooooo simple to use straight out of the box.  The stakes are made from a sturdy material that won't rust or rot.  The clips are easy to place around the plant so that you don't destroy the plant while trying to place the stakes around it.  Also, the clips do not have to be parallel to each other.  So if part of your plant is heavy on one side and then on up a ways, it gets heavier on the other side, you can arrange the horizontal clips in any configuration you like to best support your plant.  When done this cage is very easy to store.  You just unclip the horizontal bars and everything wraps up with a twisty tie until next year.  These will definitely be something I purchase more of for the garden.  Some real thought went into these product!
B000RUM0R4 It is still early days for a full review - I think if these make it to next year in the garage I'll have to edit this review up to five stars. Seems like nothing survives my garage...The poles are very sturdy and provide plenty of room for large (and growing larger ^_^) tomato plants or other plants that vine out of control.  I've got it supporting one of my bigger tomato plants and it is doing just dandy.The poles are some kind of plasti-composition with little bumps on them which I think gives them a weird feel but it allows the plants to grasp better too I suppose.  These poles are taller than I am.
B000RUM0R4 We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.
B000RUM0R4 This is a solid tomato plant cage, and can easily recommend.Pros:- Flexible arms (guide them to the fruit laden branches for support)- Tough stakes - hard to bend, will keep it grounded.- Can place it around an already growing plant (with a little effort, but much easier than a regular wire cage) without damaging the plant.- Stores flat - can reuse next year, and the one after.Neutral:- Look for sales, you can get them for a  lot less at other stores.Recommended, especially in the $5-7 dollar range.
B000RUM0R4 Unfortunately the product came damaged during shipping, and it was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It seems to be doing better than the cheap cages I have been using. I wish the product would be wider to support the plant as it grows bigger.
B000RUM0R4 As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers.
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, create brackets that clip to some of those standard corrugated green garden stakes, then sell as a package. The problem is, this was shipped just in plastic and bubble wrap, with nothing to protect the stakes, so it showed up totally bent (and trying to bend it back to shape causes the stake to crack in half). I uploaded a pic to the product page if you want to have a look.My suggestion to the company would be to sell just the brackets (easy to ship) and have people use their own stakes. Or send them in a box.
B000RUM0R4 As with most people I know in the Northwest, we are avid gardeners and optimists to the max when it comes to being able to raise tomato plants.  Still, we have figured out that you need short times for ripening and you need to keep your plants well supported.To that end, I decided to give this product a try.  Things that really interested me were the following:1.  Compact storage:  There is NEVER enough room to store all of the garden stuff an that especially applies to tomato cages.  Most are very bulky, but this one breaks down into small and easy to store pieces.2.  Moveable supports:  I have not yet found a tomato plant that will put it branches just where the preformed supports are in most tomato cages.  Thus, having the ability to move a support to where it is needed is great.3.  Metal stakes that are plastic coated:  The base construction of this unit uses plant supports that I have used for years in the garden.  They are basically hollow metal stakes that are plastic coated.  I have several that are over 15 years old and are still providing garden structure support.4.  Extra supports are available:  Amazon carries extra support cross members, but there is a catch, you have to have an order that totals more than $25 or they will delete it from your order!!!!  So, if you think you want extra supports, order them at the same time you order your plant supports!Here is what I liked about working with the product:1.  Very easy to assemble and the assembly can be accomplished either before the plant is in the ground or after the plant is in the ground.  Personally, I think it is much easier to put the unit together, install it in the ground, and then plant your plant.  Keep in mind that you MUST insert the legs of this unit at least 12 inches into your ground if you want it to provide good support for a heavy tomato plant!!!!!!!!!!!!  that is NOT mentioned anywhere in their instructions, but it is what most gardener's would do if they were building their own support.2.  Once assembled and installed in the ground, it is VERY easy to move support members around!!!  Remember to follow the directions about clipping the supports on from the inside and NOT from the outside.3.  The green color of the materials disappear into the foliage of the plants making it more visually appealing.Here is what I did not like about the product:1.  Amazon limiting the ability to order extra supports unless your total order is more than $25.  The way it is worded on the website, it looks like free shipping is limited unless the order is more than $25.  That is not what they are saying,  your ability to order it at all is limited to the fact that your total order must be at least $25 or they will remove it from your order.  This makes no sense to me since there are many low cost items that you can order on Amazon.  Thus, if you order some batteries for $5 and supports for $15 for a total order of $20, they will remove the supports from the order and only ship out the $5 of batteries!  What sense does that make???????????Overall, I am currently happy with the product, but will need to come back and update this after the growing season to be able to add how well this works with plants as they grow.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and flexible support system.  Just remember my caution about including any additional supports you want with your order.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for two seasons now and just got around to writing a review. I'll probably use them next season, too, but I think potential buyers should be aware of some things.The \"cage\" comes as a set of three stakes and nine plastic bars; both ends of the bar snap onto a stake, usually assembled as you see in pictures (three groups of three bars, although you can really space them however you want). I've lost a couple plastic bars over the years, but I notice some local garden centers sell replacement bars, probably for this reason. I suppose you could also get them to add another set of bars to the cage. The stakes are 5 ft tall, but you'll have to put them into the ground a bit, making the effective height a bit less.The stakes are also somewhat thin, and the bars are easily removable. This is good because it makes for easy storage but can be bad because heavy plants--like tomatoes--can easily push the bars off the stakes (probably why I've lost a couple). Together with the thin stakes, this makes the whole cage somewhat light and definitely NOT suitable for indeterminate tomatoes. You may have better luck with determinates, but I've never grown any true determinates in these to test. I've given up on using these for tomatoes and have stuck to using them with bell peppers, jalapenos (probably could have done without any cage on those, but I had some extra), and cucumbers, which I more or less successfully tried to make climb up the cage. The removable--and movable--plastic bars on the cage were very helpful for this. I didn't have an issue with the weight of the cucumber fruit weighing down the cage, toppling it over, or breaking the bars off, but everything was much lighter here than my tomatoes. I suspect other plants like peas would also work well (maybe spread it out instead of putting it like a cage, depending on how you plant them). I'd hate to try it with melons or squash, but if I was desperate for space and had nothing else I might see how it works.In summary, these cages are OK, but you'll need to stick to lighter plants: *maybe* determinate tomatoes, definitely *not* indeterminates, and besides tomatoes otherwise lighter plants like cucumbers or peppers. If they didn't market these for tomatoes (including the name of the cage itself!), I might rate them a little higher. They aren't horrible, but you'll have to be careful how you use them. For tomatoes themselves, after having used a variety of tomato support methods, I decided to make a \"Florida weave\" last season with not much more than metal T-posts and twine. (There are also a few other \"homemade\" solutions out there.\") Do a Web search for this if you're interested--it worked out well for me and was much less expensive than buying cages. They're also easy to store, and I suspect the metal posts will last me much, much longer than these cages.
B000RUM0R4 This tomato (or any plant) cage is sturdy, adjustable and reusable. The three supporting poles are made of a strong metal core with a hard plastic covering. This covering has ridges which keeps the adjustable horizontal attachment bars from slipping down the pole when the weight of the tomato branches increases with the growing season. I have accidentally broken off many stems/branches in the past when trying to accommodate the growing plant within a fixed support cage - the plant grows or needs extra support when branches become heavy with fruit, and the traditional fixed metal cages do not allow adjustments without bending/breaking stems in the process. This design allows you accommodate the plant as often as needed by adjusting the horizontal bars of the cage as often as you need to.  They snap on and off easily and can be placed anywhere on the vertical poles. By connecting several cages in a row, you can build a network of supports for many plants.  This is the best method I have tried so far, compared to fixed square and round cages and wooden stakes. I have yet to use it a second season, and the plastic horizontal bars may not hold up to years of wear and tear - they are plastic and less sturdy than the poles. But each cage comes with many bars, so extras are available in the event of a breakage.
B000RUM0R4 I moved from a ranch to a condo, and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening.  I knew that I would be starting with an heirloom tomato in a City Pickers box, and when I saw this tomato cage offered via the Amazon Vine program, I grabbed it.Because it takes a while to see the longevity of a product that will be in the sun most of the day, I can't comment yet on the durability of the product.  Let's just say that I am a bit skeptical about the cross pieces lasting longer than one season, as it they are constructed out of plastic.  The uprights are constructed out of steel coasted with plastic, but they are rather lightweight.PROS:The tomato cage was easily assembled.  I had it put together and in the box in no time. The design is very clever.  I like it a lot better than the wire tomato cages that are metal cones (seeGalvanized Tomato Cage 33\"X12\"-3 Ring/3 Legs) which I have found to be flimsy and easily bent out of shape.  (At my previous residence I had the most success with homemade cages assembled from leftover field fencing supported by metal fence posts. Field fence has generous spacing between the wires.)CONS:The directions say to put the cage about 8 - 10 inches deep into the soil.  That does not seem very deep if one expects to support a large tomato plant.  I had no control over the depth that I had to set mine in, as it's in a box. (see product images) I get the feeling that once my tomato plant gets to a  large size that I am going to need to fasten the cage to the balcony rail to keep it from toppling over.  But, that's speculation at this point.I know that this review is incomplete at this point, and I do apologize about that.  But I do intend to post updates throughout the upcoming growing season.  Stay tuned for further developments....Three stars for now, as I am a bit skeptical about how well this cage is going to work out.UPDATE:  June 4, 2013I have had the cage in place for a month.  I must say that my opinion of this cage is slowly sinking in the west.  I had to add a row of string as an additional support for my young tomato plant.  I also had to fasten it to my balcony railing with zip ties, as even a moderate breeze would send it leaning to the side.  I decided to anchor it down before it tipped over and took my tomato with it.  See product images.Final opinion:  A waste of money unless you have some way to support it.
B000RUM0R4 This is only my 3rd year growing tomatoes so I am still a novice gardener. Since I live in a condo, all my gardening is done in containers--usually 5-gallon buckets. Even though this tomato cage is not intended for containers, I was able to make it work because it is so adjustable and versatile.The cage arrives UNASSEMBLED but assembly is easy. There are 3 5-ft. stakes and 9 support clips. The support clips snap onto the stakes very easily (it reminded me of a large Tinker Toy project). What's great is that, as your plant grows, you can readjust the space between the support rods to support your plant's branches and fruit/vegetables. This isn't something you can do with most other tomato cages.As noted in the product description, the stakes have a steel core with plastic around them. They are VERY strong. However, the support clips are completely plastic and I would recommend not being to rough with them during assembly or readjustment during growth of your plant. I did not have any breakage but, in \"forcing\" the cage to fit my 5-gallon bucket, the clips were definitely bending.I just put my tomato plants in yesterday so I can't speak yet to how well the cage functions in supporting the plant's growth, but since it is so adjustable, I can't imagine there being much of a problem. If there is, I will update my review once my plants have grown a few feet tall.I have never had a cage this tall so I'm looking forward to having less work this year in keeping my plants supported as they grow and bear fruit!I took a picture of my cage in the container with the small tomato plant to show customers, but unfortunately this company is not allowing customers to share their own images of the product.4 stars for now. This may change as my plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 These vegetable support stakes are a nice 5 feet tall which leaves you at least 4 to 4 1/2 feet once you get it stuck in the ground.  They are coated metal and went into the ground easily on the pointed in.  I didn't even have to use a rubber mallet on them.  If you do have to use a rubber mallet on them, be sure to protect the coating on the stake with a piece of cloth before pounding.  They come with 9 connectors that are 12inches long and snap into place easily so you can configure them anyway you want.  You can make a triangle or free form shape.  They are green and unobtrusive looking.  Rather than tomatoes, I used them for my pole beans that are growing like skyscrapers.  After the pole beans are done, I will move them to my tomatoes which aren't very tall yet.  I'm am pleased with this product and would recommend it.  My only concern would be if the connectors will break of their end clips or not as I reconfigure them.  So far, no problem.
B000RUM0R4 At first glance this seemed pretty flimsy. The plastic coating fooled me into thinking that it was solid plastic for a moment.  But it's plastic coated steel, which makes for a robust and probably long-lived outdoor product.  Once assembled, it can actually stand on its own on a solid surface which is something one of those flimsy not-quite-wire-but-almost cages can't do.  It looks like it's going to support even the heaviest stalks without tipping over, which is something I have longed for in my tomato cages.  I'm tired of having to readjust them virtually every day.The modular design is really brilliant.  Getting bonked in the head by the uprights a couple of times during assembly is a fair trade-off for dealing with the wobbly, never-quite-fits-together-properly quality of lesser cages.  The cross-bars snap on and snap off easily making for compact winter storage as well as easy reassembly.The price is more than fair for what you get. I look forward to many years of tomato-growing with the Ultomato
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, though perhaps it should be used for plants that are going to stay a reasonably small size (unlike, say, Sungold tomatoes). Of course I won't really know how well it works until I have it supporting a fully grown tomato plant, and I won't have any of those for about ninety days. However, since Vine members are now required to have reviews in within thirty days, I guess this will have to do for now. Perhaps I can add something else later in the year.Sep 18. Still doing a good job of supporting a \"Goliath\"plant which has already produced around 20lbs of big tomatoes. One of the nice things about it is being able to move the crossbars, which I have done as the plant has grown. It's now around four feet tall. Very pleased with it.
B000RYL1BQ The current picture photo shows folding wings which can extend out to turn the compost.  The unit I received has no moving parts, but a welded piece that goes out into two posts.  Ultimately I'm happier with this design as it feels like it has much less change of breaking.  Although based on the looks of the 'winged' one it appears as it might have been easier to insert into the compost pile.It gets the job done, allowing you to insert it into the compost pile, turn and get it worked up.  I have let my compost bin go too long all to often, forgetting to rotate and move the compost, but this aerator is an easy way to get it stirred up.
B000RYL1BQ I started my first compost last summer.  Before then, my sum experience with compost was dumping coffee, peels, and veggie parts in a trench in my garden.  I made some mistakes with theGood Ideas EZCJR-BLK 7-Cubic-Foot Compost Wizard Jr., particularly in its placement.  It was in a back corner of my yard and even though I shoveled it out for a few months, eventually it ended up under a few feet of snow.  My sum total of compost was about a gallon.  I can't believe I put that much stuff in there and ended up with such a small amount.Back to the drawing board.  I went back to my garden compost and discovered that I had a lot of rich dirt that had continued after I abandoned it.  That is where is used the aerator, to pull the compost out and rotate it and move it around the garden.  The first few lifts of it were much heavier and it wasn't as easy to pull out.  But this aerater is exactly what I needed to rotate the ground.  It opens up as I pull it out, and it makes it do a lot, very easily.
B000RYL1BQ My daughter picked the compost project in last school year (middle school). It turned out not too bad for our garden. So, I kept doing compost for fertilizing our garden. This compost aerator is easy to get into the center of the compost pile. But the wings (or fins) at the bottom usually stick together and don't move the compost. Once a while, one of the wing does open when I pull this aerator out, but not always. Not sure if I does not use this tool correctly or I just got a bad unit.
B000RYL1BQ I agree with other reviewers (all of whom I read before ordering) about the wings not opening with regularity when plunging this tool into the compost pile.That being said, this tool has great thrust, is easy for even my arthritic hands to use, and doesn't require a lot of upper-body strength to do a reasonable turning session of a single compost pile.  I've taken the other reviewers suggestions to plunge it in at a slight angle then give it a twist to open the wings, before pulling it up. This seems to work well.  This is also how I discovered that my beloved BioBag Food Waste Bio Bags, 3 Gallon 25 ea that I use for composting, are NOT degrading at all (as they came up impaled on the wings), so now I simply empty them into my bins, and throw the bags into the regular trash.I'm hopeful that this tool speeds up the process of composting in my bins, especially now that the warmer weather is coming.  I do love all of that glorious black soil!
B000RYL1BQ I actually didn't realize there was a tool specific for this purpose until I saw this!I have a large compost bin, and tried using a shovel and a pitchfork to turn it over (which it needs regularly to make good compost).  Neither was effective or easy.This aerator is both -- it is a huge help in making compost.  Compost gets clumped very easily, especially during the rainy season, and this really helps to aerate it, as well as turn things under and keep things generally rotated.  I definitely recommend this to someone who composts a lot.
B000RYL1BQ This compost aerator is sturdy with quality, solid construction. A great tool for turning or churning your compost pile/bin.Help other customers find the most helpful reviews

B000RYL1BQ The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from, were worthless.  I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.
B000RYL1NE This Applicator works good, but my Gophers have not died yet, or I have not notice it yet!I live on 10 acres ,on a river, we have allot of huge boulders, where thegophers like to hide.So its not always possible to get into the area that there in!I have to plant all veggies etc. in Large containers, but if a  veggies drops to theground without a piece of wood there, gophers are on it, and of course at night.I'm not seeing the ground coming up, but mainly Gopher holes, that is where I'm sticking thistube at and realeasing the pellets into, then covering it upThat said, this Yard Butler Bait Applicator works very good..I know other friends that have this, and forthem it gets there Gophers..Going to keep trying to get those suckers.If I notice a big difference I will be back to give a up-date.
B000RYL1NE This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended.
B000RYL2CY This does a great job of allowing me to use my front yard hose without crawling through shrubbery to get to the house spigot.  The shape and support leg are a benefit to stability.  I hadn't considered how I'd need a short extension hose to reach from it to the spigot, nor that I'd have to have a hose hanger next to it and have had to buy both to augment this unit.  But one benefit from having the extender separate from the hose holder is that I don't have to worry about the weight of the coiled hose tipping it nor will I have any issue accessing its spigot through the coils of a hose hanging over it.The unit goes into the ground pretty easily (I used a small sledge hammer on the support leg) and sinks far enough down to make it very sturdy.  It is a hollow square shape that allows dirt to fill in the middle of the buried part as you sink it.  You get better purchase in the ground than with a single rod structure.  Both my extender hose and regular hose attached with no leaks.  That's especially key with the extender hose since the spigot at the house is always on so you are counting on this unit to stop the flow when not in use.I had such an arrangement in the past but the extender was very low to the ground, where this one is about 18&#34; out of the ground and an easy height to access.  Its color is muted and blends in with the shrubbery so doesn't attract attention.
B000RYL2CY This would have been a great product if it didn't leak. It is all metal and has brass fittings. There are no plastic parts. I used some of that white teflon tape where the hose connection goes, but the part that connects the fitting to the pole also leaked. I had to use one of those plumbing/welding products to stop that leak. So far it is holding up.
B000RYL2CY Our hydrant is practically at ground level in an area that's frequently overgrown, so groping around for the handle in tall grass, stopped over, has always been unnerving (Kansas is spider country). This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.
B000RYL2CY Unfortunately I'm not able to recommend this product as it appears to have poor quality control. This arrived with a broken handle/hose bib despite no evidence of wear/tear to the box or packing. Basically unable to use in current condition and trying to find a replacement hose bib that fits to repair isn't worth the time or effort of driving across town with this thing in tow. AVOID.
B000RYL2CY I'm using mine next to my vegetable garden.  I am a square foot gardener so I have raised beds & I have to keep them fenced in with chicken wire or the rabbits will eat everything.  The fence has always been a problem when watering because the hose hangs over/on the fence & causes it to sag.  But with this yard butler, I can get enough height to clear the chicken wire.It was easy to set up.  I used a block of wood on top & then pounded it into the ground with a hammer.  Don't use a hammer on the metal butler itself or you will likely cause damage.Mine has been working for 2 weeks so far with no leaks.  From reading other reviews, it seems there are good/bad ones; I guess I got a good one.  I'll update my review if it goes bad.
B000RYL2CY I have two gardens, one off of each end of the house. They need a lot of watering. It's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose. (Walking back and forth to the house each time). I tried the hose \"Y's\" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the \"rubber\" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use. The product should not be purchased.
B000RYL2CY When driving this into the ground, I would recommend instead of pounding on the top of the main stake, use a stone or small cement block to pound on the perpendicular welded piece of metal that's attached about six inches from the bottom. The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6\". If your soil is a bit looser on top, it's not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.
B000RYOAHS To cut to the chase - this isn't worth the current $35 price for my uses.I really like some of the design features on this cultivator.  I like how the rotary blade assemblies are modular and can be replaced one at a time, or simply removed one by one to allow for a different tilling pattern in your garden.  That's pretty cool.  I also like the twist-lock feature on the extendable handle, versus other tools that I have that screw to tighten.  At least for me, the handle was very easy to lock/unlock in position, and it didn't come loose when I was using it.While I do love the twist-lock on the handle, one downside is that you can only go between the two lengths of fully-retracted or fully-extended.  You can't customize the length anywhere in between.  The length worked for me, and I'm 5'9\".The reason for my rating this as just \"OK\" with three stars is that it didn't churn up my soil very well.  Yes, I put my back into it.  :)  I tried it on my lawn before reseeding, which was essentially compacted top soil, and also on a couple of other areas that have more loose dirt.  I wasn't too impressed by how much effort it took for so little turnover on the soil.  Now, that might just be because my soil is more compacted than most and that I really need a powered tiller, but unless you have looser soil - you might experience the same thing.So, I was impres
B000RYOAHS Everything about this product is well made and works well except for one thing...The handle bar collapses too easily during use.  The handle bar is a simple twist lock, much like my pruner's bars (which work very well).  And if you want to have a 1/2 length bar for tilling, then this product works great.  But, I suspect most people will want to stand while tilling, and the handle bar, even though well tightened, collapses too easily under regular use.So, while everything else about this cultivator is nicely made, this one fatal flaw prevents it from being truly useful.
B000RYOAHS I used this cultivator for my existing flower gardens and for a few smaller sections of hard-packed yard.In both areas, the cultivator worked well (though to be honest, if I needed to work hard-packed areas of the yard, I would use my electric cultivator).I found that the adjustable handle worked well. I initially had problems where it would collapse as I was using it. It turns out that you need to turn the handle until you hear a soft click. Once it clicks, the handle stays in place.Configuring the blades was also very easy. Each blade is screwed into place with a bolt that&#8217;s large enough so that it&#8217;s easy to turn. It took less than a minute to add or remove a blade.Overall, I liked using this cultivator.
B000RYOAHS A bad back is a problem when you like to garden since pretty much every gardening task puts a strain on your back. While this is not a perfect solution, it provides for less back strain than using a hoe for weeding.The build quality is pretty good. It feels solid, but is lightweight to handle. The telescoping action of the handle is easy to use (simple twist lock) and stays put when extended except for the most severe pushing. The tiller blades (or prongs, actually) are sharp and each can be removed to configure the tool for specific tasks, such as edge weeding. The blades are held in place with a nut that goes right through the blade frame, which is far better than a friction fit that other similar tools have.The catch is that this is not something that will replace a digging hoe or tiller. It&#8217;s for light weeding on ground that has been well-worked. For that task it performs well and offers the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to use a lift and chop motion as you would with a hoe, but rather a back and forth motion. I find that easier on my back.It also works well to help spread out pine bark mulch, avoiding the need to bend as much during that task. The rotating tines even out the mulch better and easier than using a bow rake.The handle grip is plastic and comfortable. No need to wear gloves to protect your hands when using this (although gloves are never a bad idea when gardening).I&#8217;ll give this 5 stars since, for light weeding on worked ground it performs very well, and has good build quality for the price. I would not, however, recommend this for more strenuous tasks such as breaking new ground or tilling.
B000RYOAHS This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but don't expect it to do much in harder dirt.  For the amount of muscle I'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt, I might as well just poke it with a fork.
B000RYPZQ8 i was so excited to get this until i saw that lowes had it for less.  was kicking myself for my impatience as i had just ordered it that morning and it was already too late to cancel.  the kneeler itself is great though hard to pull the spring to fold and open it
B000RYPZQ8 I can't say enough about this Garden Butler.  It is QUALITY MADE and easy to use.  The side rails fold up easily but lock in place for a secure handle that you can raise yourself up with.  The kneeling pad is made of a thick foam that absorbs the pressure when you kneel down on your knees.  Makes it easy to plant and get down to ground level.  Well made and very much worth the price.  I really can kick myself for not getting one sooner.  Anyone with knee problems will love this thing.  I recommend it.
B000RYPZQ8 I bought this kneeler when I was having serious back and knee problems, since managed with physical therapy. But I still use this whenever I'm planting or weeding in the garden. It takes a load off my knees, protects them from cuts and scrapes, and helps take the strain off my back.After three years of use and storage outdoors in my garage, one of the foam pads fell off. Considering that it lives in a plastic bin on my rear deck year round, this is not too surprising; the temperature cycling, heat, and humidity probably dissolved the original thin glue layer. I re-attached the pad with  Gorilla Glue and it's good as new again.
B000RYPZQ8 The arthritis in my feet and knees has advanced enough in the past few years that I find it difficult to get up if I have to kneel down for something. Additionally, I have a bad meniscus in my right knee that often makes it painful to put my entire weight on that leg to push myself up to a standing position unassisted.I was putting my garden last month and was excited to find this Garden Kneeler and Seat here on Amazon. Turn it one way and it is a small elevated seat. Turn it the other and it is a low kneeler. The benefit of this kneeler over those ones that are just a free-standing foam pad is that this kneeler has sturdy steel \"arms\" that you can use to push yourself up from a kneeling to a standing position. You could easily use it in the house as well, for when you drop something and need to get down to pick it up. I found it to be stable--not wobbly at all--when I was pushing myself up from the kneeler.The kneeler comes folded up and you just have to pull the legs out to open it. This took a LITTLE doing but not bad. I actually keep mine in the out position all the time now instead of folding it and unfolding it all the time. My kneeler (in the seat position) sits just inside my garage door with my garden bucket and supplies on it, so I can quickly grab them and head out to the garden.When my kneeler first arrived, I found the material used to make the seat/kneeler part of the device to be odd. It feels like a dense version of the foam you use to make flower arrangements. As such, it does not give much when you kneel on it, but there is some give. I sat on the seat when I was out in the garden last week. Since it is so narrow, it would not be comfortable for me to sit on it for an extended time (as my behind is not narrow) but it certainly was comfortable enough for me to accomplish the task at hand.My concern about this foam-type substance used in the seat is that it may be difficult to clean if it became stained.  That remains to be seen.Please note that this seat/kneeler is never to be used as a stepstool and that the weight limit is 250 pounds. The kneeler itself weights 8.5 pounds.Definitely recommended.
B000RYPZQ8 I love this garden kneeler! I've been using it for two years and the hinges are still tight and strong. I use it both ways - sitting and kneeling. I have bad knees, so sometimes I find that it's hard to get up off of the ground after weeding. The Yard Butler is very sturdy and it's the right height, so I can push myself up smoothly without any issues. I don't always kneel on it, sometimes I'm beside it, but I still make sure it's within reach to help me get up.  It folds up for storage, so it's easy to tuck away when not in use. I have it hanging in my garden shed. When I bought this one two years ago, it was to replace one that I had for many years that disappeared. I can't imagine weeding without it.
B000S61YO2 I was looking for an auger that would be wide and long enough for greenhouse posts but not require special equipment. I used this auger with my corded drill to dig holes for the posts for my greenhouse. My drill isn't special, just your typical home depot drill and it connected to it perfectly. It dug very easily through my rock-hard clay soil with each hole only taking about 20 seconds to dig.  The trick to prevent it from getting stuck is to bring it up every 4-6 inches to clear the hole from debris. This will be a keeper for all the bulb-planting I have to do in the spring.I would definitely recommend this auger.
B000S61YO2 Not sure what more to say about this. Does what it's meant to do, and does it well. My only concern is that the shaft that you put into the drill is round, and my drill is meant to hold square drill bits. I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it seemed to work just fine.
B000S61YO2 I bought this for tree fertilizing not for bulb planting. I have a 19.2 volt drill. Using this in tough conditions. But unless I flood the ground it makes almost no headway. And when I flood it, it still doesn't go down quite enough.If you intend this for fertilizing at least in clay soils, it might not work so well. I was looking forward to some deep fertilizing and unfortunately has not worked as I had hoped.
B000S61YO2 This very easily fit into the drill bit and we were able to dig smaller holes big enough in our hard ground to be able to put up a small fence to keep the chickens in their yard. Very happy with the reduced work load.
B000S61YO2 I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8\" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24\" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago.
B000S61YO2 This is  a great tool and has many uses but they need to make one slight modification. In my hard soil I could not get the chuck tight enough to grip the shaft of this roto planter without slipping. I took it to the grinding wheel and ground some flats on the shaft at the end that slides into the drill chuck and that took care of any slippage. An easy enough fix but every one who buys this might not have that option available to them. Now that I took care of the slippage I am finding many uses besides the intended bulb planting. I really think it would be difficult though to dig under a sidewalk with it, as mentioned in the description. I docked it one star because I think the manufacturer should have put the flats on the shaft...not me.
B000SDKGC6 Very easy to set, just insert in tunnel and STEP on the cocking mechanism. GOT ONE THE FIRST NIGHT. The double scissors means they are caught no matter which direction. This particular mole was making it dangerous to walk without twisting an  ankle.
B000SDKGC6 Ordered this trap and was impressed with 
B000SDKGC6 This is a well designed product, strong and sturdy. It is easy to set and remove. Unfortunately in six months I haven't caught a single gopher yet. They are tearing up our lawn. I'm switching to a different product.Perhaps I'm not using these properly. The other thing is our lawn is mostly hard clay which might not be the soil in which this works best. We've found the trap tripped a couple of times but no joy. I know others have had much better luck with this model.
B000SDKGC6 This is hard to rate as it has never been tripped. I catch a lot of moles with a cinch type trap, but these have not worked for me. I'm sure they work, but my moles go around them. It must be too large or something, but they apparently sense it. I'm not sure.
B000SP2JLU This is the perfect birdfeeder for my front yard.  I mounted it by hanging it from a Live Oak tree, using a \"hook\" similar to this Petco Green Bird Feeder Hanger and a thin, strong chain something like thisDroll Yankees LC18 Locking Chain.It's heavy enough when filled to hang well & the smaller birds like sparrows now get to eat more, since this is a bit small for our coveys of doves.  Occasionally, a young dove will land on top of the feeder, trying to figure out how to get some seed, only to close the doors for the other birds.  So far, the squirrel hasn't tangled with this, probably due to my precarious Rube Goldberg setup.I like the unobtrusive look of the feeder & I like that it holds enough seed for about a week of feeding (it's getting more popular; first it was 2 weeks, then a week, now about 5 days!).  It's relatively easy to fill; springs hold the lid on and can be tension adjusted for the \"right\" amount of feeder restriction if you do have a curious squirrel.  A winner!Have questions?  Leave a comment & I'll help you if I can.UPDATE 5/2/13:  Yet another advantage of this feeder is that its slim design handles windy conditions better than conventional feeders.  I live in Texas & springtime can get WINDY.  I briefly exchanged this feeder with a square one & immediately noticed strong swinging and spinning motions that were keeping the birds from perching.  Changed back to this feeder the same day & noticed how much less this feeder's affected by wind, due to its leaner profile.UPDATE 6/8/13:  A squirrel braved the Rube Goldberg setup yesterday & made it down the hook, down the chain, and onto the feeder.  Only to be TOTALLY frustrated, since his weight closed off all the feeding stations, just as promised : )
B000SP2JLU We have tons of birds AND squirrels around our house. We can open the back door and see them all over hunting for food. We've even watched them from our back door stealing dog food off the porch. Many times!! We hope the poor things don't choke on it.That said, we can't seem to attract any birds or squirrels to this thing to even test it out. I've even moved it around the yard a bit and watched from my back door. They don't even come close to it.So, I can't tell you how well it works as far as keeping the squirrels away, since I can't seem to catch anything eating or trying to eat from it.As far as looks, it's pretty. I like the way it looks in our yard. It's a little hard to fill with the way the top goes on. As long as you expect to spill some bird seed(the birds will eat it anyway), it's fine, though.
B000SP2JLU A simple yet extremely effective design for  keeping squirrels out of the wild bird seed. My only two concerns are at the two separate ends--the top does not open far enough/easily enough to effectively fill the feeder and the bottom while designed I'm certain to make cleaning it easier also makes it easy for it to be dislodged and all the seed pours out on the ground--something I discovered after a strong wind storm blew the feeder off the pole it was hung on, dropping it 4 feet to the ground. These two issues are extremely minor in comparison to the extremely attractive and effective baffle mechanism for keeping the seed away from the squirrels--if there was a way to rate this as a 4.9 out of 5 I would not hesitate. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends many hours every day at his dining room table watching the squirrels get frustrated that they can not get to the seed, no matter how hard they try. The mechanism for setting the \"weight\" allowed to gain access to the seed is extremely well designed and made--adding value. Again two very minor issues that other wise would make this an outstanding squirrel proof feeder! christina & bogie
B000SP2JLU OUR OLD ONE FELL & BROKE BEYOND REPAIR.  COULD NOT FIND ONE AT THE USUAL RETAIL PLACES.  GOT THIS ONE FROM AMAZON AND IT IS THE SAME KIND.  WORKS WELL AND AT A FAIR PRICE.  THEY ONLY MODIFICATION I MADE ON MINE WAS TO TAKE THE CLEAR TUBE OUT AND USE CLEAR PACKING TAPE TO SEAL OFF THE TOP 4 OPENINGS.  OTHERWISE, THE BIRDS CAN EMPTY IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE FEEDER COULD BE OFFERED WITH PLUGS.
B000SP2JLU I found the PERKY-PET SQUIRREL-BE-GONE FEEDER to be somewhat of a mixed bag.  While the concept is sound - springs lower the feeder when a squirrel gets on it such that the outside feeding holes no longer line up with the inside ones - the actual application leaves a little to be desired.  Since the springs are out in the elements and are relatively small, I don't give the feeder more than one or two seasons before water, dirt, feed, and bird waste fouls up the springs causing them to rust and seize up.  Admittedly, I have only had the feeder for about 6 months and it still works as good as new (as far as I can tell), the writing is clearly on the wall.The other problem I have is when larger bids land on the feeder, such as woodpeckers or a random crow, the cage drops just as if a squirrel got on.  So far no smaller bird had its head in the feeder whole when the larger bird landed, but I can see some mini-guillotine action going on if some unlucky Nuthatch was feeding the same time as my Pileated Woodpecker came along.  Obviously that would not be good for the bird - or make me very happy.All told, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the feeder too much longer because of the issues above.  It's pretty and appears to be working well now, but the drawbacks clearly out-weigh the good points.
B000SP2JLU I have two of these things.  Once is a relatively recent purchase, the other has been in place for close to a year now.  I have mixed emotions about these feeders and have had mixed results.  It was interesting to me that other reviewers here have had very similar complaints as to the effectiveness of this feeder that I have.Overall this is a good feeder and the concept is great.  It should be noted though that almost ANY feeder that claims to be \"squirrel proof\" is stretching the facts just a bit.  Squirrels are bright animals and if there is a way of getting around all the devices we humans attempt to discourage their raiding of feeders, they will find a way.  That is a fact.  Now I will tell you that this particular feeder is better than most I have used in the past.  We have been feeding birds at this particular location for well over thirty years now and have gone through a lot of feeders; both commercial and home made.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I estimate that we have at least 30 to 40 of the little critters living on our place - we live in the woods.  We have a very large number of bird feeders...always have.Anyway, while this feeder is better than most, it does have a couple of flaws.  First, the squirrels quickly learned that if they shake the feeder seeds will eventually fall out...not a lot of seeds, but never-the-less than manage to get a share of them.  Secondly, the springs which run the squirrel proof portion of the feeder are located on the outside of the container.  They are constantly exposed to weather condition which does the springs no good what so ever.  I keep mine treated with 3 in 1 oil, applied in very small amounts which seems to help not only with the actual working mechanism, but does inhibit rust and corrosion.  I have not had the problem others have had with the varmints chewing on the holes and enlarging them as of yet.The feeder is easy to load and is attractive.  It is more effective than many like products and I will continue using them.  I don't begrudge the squirrels a meal now and then actually as I enjoy them and their antics but to be quite frank, with the cost of feed and seed these days, feeding a herd of hungry squirrels had become a bit of a financial burden.Overall I am giving this one four starts but can well understand why some have ranked it lower.Don BlankenshipThe  Ozarks
B000SP2JLU I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
B000SP2JLU Update weeks later:  We didn't re-fill the feeder for several weeks, and only a few seeds remained at the bottom. Still, the birds kept flocking to this feeder (despite another one, full, about 25 yards away and similarly situated). I can't figure it out, but they really seem to love this feeder. When the other feeder is empty, there's no activity around it.Yesterday, we refilled, and man, they're going nuts! They seem to squawk a lot more at this feeder -- flying around and staking out a position, and making a whole lot of noise in the process. Again, it seems to be the same birds who frequent the other feeder but aren't so noisy. It's not really a problem; just funny how different feeders elicit different responses.Update several days later:  Still no squirrel, habitually demoralized or otherwise. But one thing I notice: Even though the birds are flocking to the feeder (mostly finches and titmice), it's hard to see them from 20 feet or so. They blend into the color of the feeder and the seeds. This might be a good thing if it thwarts the hawks known to frequent our pine tree but it does make it harder to enjoy seeing the birds.---This feeder is not as sturdy or as well-designed as our current squirrel-proof feederBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, but it's also less expensive.I'd say that this model is more appropriate for small, sheltered gardens where aesthetics and a more compact size are more important than rugged durability and functionality. (It's currently hanging in a mostly shaded area; I don't think the plastic liner would last long where our other feeder hangs, in full sun.)I see the feeder from my desk, and I've seen only one squirrel so far attempt it. It was quickly discouraged and went away.  Of course I can't attribute this to the feeder. Our squirrels might simply have been easily discouraged after too many failed attempts at the Brome feeder.
B000SP2JLU [Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET.

B0013OX9NC I bought this to help with my night blindness.. I dreaded driving at night and would not if I could help it because the bright glare of headlights literally blinded me and so did the reflection of my lights on roadsigns and it scared the hell out of me. I even tried those yellow sunglasses for night driving but they did not help. I am 48 and thought I was going to have to have cornea surgery like my mom but I have no insurance :(. So I googled supplements to help with night blindness/vision problems and this came up.I talked to my dad who is 74 and he said take this it works and that he has been taking it for 20 yrs and has perfect vision.. So I bought this and took 2 on Monday, took 2 on Tuesday and one Wednesday morning on my way out the door at 4am for work for my dreaded 26 mile drive to work in the dark...And as I was driving I slowly realized that the glare of my headlights on the roadsigns did not bother me and that the headlights of other cars did glare at me and i did not have to turn my mirrors like I usually did to try to avoid the lights. As I drove in the dark to work I thought OMG I can flippin see!  lol  The bright glare of lights were no longer blinding me..This cured my night vision problems and cured them fast. Amazing, just amazing...It is so nice to be able to see to drive at night again liki when i was in my 20 and 30s..I will take this for the rest of my life
B0013OX9NC My Dad has emasculate degeneration (hope I spelled that right) and so I am concerned about inheriting that gene.  Figured after seeing this on Dr. Oz to give it a try and after two weeks noticed a big improvement in the clarity of my vision.  I'd definitely recommend this produce.
B0013OX9XW For the past 6 months this has replaced my prescription cumadin without any issues. My INR is great and though my doctors are not happy about being cut out of the money making scheme of prescription drugs they cant argue with the results. I was on the road to having to take blood thinners for the rest of my life and the side effects are unpleasant. When I switched to this the side effects slowly dissipated and now are completely gone. I recommend this to anyone wanting a natural way to get the same results as a prescription. Of course always consult with your doctor first and make sure they monitor you along the way.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is one of many enzymes isolated from the fermented food product known as Natt&#333; (boiled soybeans fermented specifically with the bacteria Bacillus subtilis), and it is supposed to help with circulation (blood pressure and possibly clotting disorders).  Since I don't have a clotting disorder, I can't say whether or not it helps with that.  I can, however, state categorically that this didn't help at all with my blood pressure.For those who do find this formula effective, be aware that it is recommended that you stop taking it two weeks before surgery, due to its possible clot dissolving properties.

B000A2HDXA I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
B000A2HOB6 Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again."
B000A2HOB6 I would definitely buy these strings again.  They are high quality, great durablity and a great price.  The Martin name is synonymous with quality."
B000A2HOB6 I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights. They give off such a warm tone, and are holding up very well."
B000A2HOB6 After reading all the great reviews, I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge. They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge. However, I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy. Finger slides are much harder with these strings. The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. As a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until I've slid those areas a couple of times. That's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them. The packaging was also a bit confusing. Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up. Other string makers I have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up. Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again."
B000A2HOB6 love these strings, but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball, they just sound better, bend easier and have a longer life span, but Martin are very good too, I just prefer Ernie Ball, but they were sold out and I needed strings fast."
B000A6ASSS these are the best strings around.  last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern."
B000A6ASSS I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating."
B000A6ASSS They're 2 days on and sound fantastic already. I've come to expect nothing but excellence from Elixirs, they're the best I've played on to date, whether electric or acoustic. I very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box"
B000A6ASSS These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150). In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.The difference between these strings - nanoweb and polyweb - the nano's have a very light coating that you almost don't feel. So if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go. If you want a bit of softness, the polys are a better bet.As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. Fresh strings do sound better. It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. But I'm not certain these last so much longer. We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.Elixir is a wonderful company. On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused. The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings. I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. It is so simple and so reproducible. I love this technique."
B000A6ASSS Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used, they sound great and last far longer (tonally) than anything else I have tried....."
B000A6ASSS Elixir's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings I've ever used on my Alvarez acoustic -- a guitar I've now owned for over 30 years.  They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers.  Unlike the Elixir Extra Lights that I found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short-scale guitar, these seem like an ideal combination.  I may buy another set soon and restring the short-scale instrument with lights.  Compared with some brands and gauges of more \"old school\" strings, there may be a little less bass response, but these sound good, pretty even through the set, and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string."
B000A6ASSS You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings.  Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another.  However, you cannot go wrong with those strings.  I highly recommend them.  I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried."
B000A6ASSS I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try.."
B000A6ASSS You can never go wrong with Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating, 6-String,...The great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost."
B000A6ASSS These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit."
B000A6ASSS they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great, these strings are not focused on performance but endurance, best string I've ever played!"
B000A6ASSS I absolutely love these strings. They enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought. They last a long time and they keep their great sound for a long time. If there was a way to give 10 stars I would."
B000A6ASSS Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings."
B000A6ASSS These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!"
B000A6ASSS If your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing, you should really get these strings. They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the D'Daddarios and they are about the same price. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent."
B000A6ASSS Very good string!! I've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now. I've been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more month's. Within these ten years I've only had 2 strings break on me, and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time"
B000A6GY1I These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me."
B000A6GY1I Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok.  Will need to check them next week or so."
B000A6GY1I Strings on my accoustic were old, probably corroded.  It was time to replace all with frest strings.  These are great, did the job."
B000A6GY1I I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings. I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my go-to brand. I've read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage. I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string (in over 10 years of playing them). Can't even imagine. The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tone--but I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more, I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed. I'm not a fan of the \"Polyweb\" which has a much more visible thick coating. The nano-webs get it right--they last a long time, sound great, and as far as I know don't flake polymer dust in your kisser."
B000AAGM0M This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky. I bought this for my son and he loves it."
B000AAGM0M This metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it.. It is so durable filled with options. Very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician."
B000AC6DVS Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had."
B000AC6DVS Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else."
B000AC6DVS If you want to get humidity into a guitar, this product is a must. I works well -- and if one lives in dry area of the country, this is a must have product."
B000AC6DVS Erm, it does what it say it would do. The nice thing about the &#34;super&#34;, is its size, in turn, and its ability to hold more water."
B000AC6DVS Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years.  I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s.  Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years.  Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air.  This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well.  In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover.  In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end.  You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar.  My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar.  I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it.  A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity."
B000AC6DVS What else is there to say, they are easy to use, they are easy to install and they are easy to check.  I've tried them all and these are the only ones I come back to.  No expensive pads to buy, just use water.  Simple to drop down into the body of guitar, no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole.  Comes out as easy as it goes in.  I have 4 of them.  Love."
B000AC6DVS I live in Arizona and I keep my acoustic in the case with this dampit unless I'm playing it.  It seems to do a good job, although I would recommend purchasing a better meter.  The one it comes with is a simple paper design that gives you a decent estimate."
B000AKSUP2 I'm not going to do any explaining about the \"science\" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones."
B000ARH3M6 A real workhorse for sure.  Not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars.  I also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big ... almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it."
B000ARH3M6 This is my 2nd Hercules Stand. Great stand for managing multiple guitars. Does not fair well when stored in non cooled area. The handle gets real sticky and causes problems. I have a friend who also experienced the same problem. So keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand."
B000B6DHAS This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding.  But it is not very good at parties.  it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make.  It is cheap, so you should just get one.  I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings, instruments, and power feed voltage levels.  (see the danelectro power supply for this thing, really cool!)"
B000B6DHAS i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now.i own all the coveted amps/guitars/fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town.i've used all the roland cubes that are battery powered.they were just fine.on a lark, i bought this danelectro honeytone. i'd read some good reviews and $20.00 isnt much money.i was shocked. going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones. but in my gig i have been using a boss me-25 with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc-2 looper and lastly, my phone with all my backing tracks. i play rythm, leads and sing in my gig.i connected all this to the single input of the n-10, put volume 1/2 and tone the same. od turned off. the sound is rich, full and IMHO sounds just as good as my roland cube street ($299.00).i have all the volume i need and great tone. the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set.i am AMAZED by this amp."
B000B6DHAS I use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great. The clean and distortion channels both sound good paired with the Danelectro Model 59 M."
B000B6DHAS The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me, but this thing is fantastic! clean tones to woodstock fuzz, this thing belts 'em out. only complaint- battery doesn't last too long. get a power adapter. otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP!"
B000B6DHB2 I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change."
B000B6DHB2 Based on other reviews, I made my purchase. This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough.Two downsides, both are about the noise.1. I live on the 4th floor. As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it. This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live.2. When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise. (Other than the radio part.)None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery."
B000B6DHB2 This is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich. Three knobs, volume, tone and gain give it a little versatility. Runs forever on a nine-volt battery. I keep mine next to the couch so I can always plug in and have some fun. It's small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to be.Overall a great little deal for the price. Stop waiting and grab one, you can't go wrong."
B000B6DHB2 I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation."
B000B6DHB2 Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries. But if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip."
B000B6FBA2 I'm giving this one 5 stars, with the caveat that you MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one, otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break. The thermoplastic ones broke on me within 2-3 months of use, 3 different ones, until I got the silver one which has not had that problem. Every music store I go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones, and they look in disbelief at me when I say they break. But they did --if I leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea, the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces, and could poke someone's eye out in a public performance, freaky. There's something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation that does it.I live in northern california, so I don't know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem.The SILVER ALUMINUM ONE by contrast, hasn't broken in now nearly a year of use, and shows no hints of doing that. It feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic-- no hint of plastic, but it is very light and not heavy like the G7 ones are. I made sure to order the silver aluminum one through Amazon, since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic, and I only want to make sure I get the aluminum one.The silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really is the best capo I've ever had, super easy to use, very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you're going from playing one song to another (you don't have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it, which is a spectacular design), it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos, and it's out of the way of your hands, doesn't interfere when you play any chord. The screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn't hurt the fingers when turning it. It's the least obtrusive and best capo ever. I'll also add that I have an old carpal injury so I want the least strain, and small hands, so I want the least awkward and most light capo, and this does that. I absolutely love it, and I'm glad that the aluminum ones are durable."
B000B6FBA2 I'm happy with this purchase. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. It works for what I use it for. When not in use, it just gets put away. Doesn't take a lot of space."
B000B6FBA2 It does a good job for it's primary purpose as a capo so I gave it four stars.  It works flawlessly, but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn't easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar.  With clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood."
B000B6FBA2 Pretty darn good in every way. Trim and easy to use. Solid construction. I recommend this capo without reservation. I like it and it is small."
B000B6FBA2 The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \"lite\",  I prefer that one above this model."
B000B6FBA2 You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this. What a pain. Oh well, it was cheap enough to have around."
B000B6FBA2 This is an awesome capo!  It's sleek, light,easy to install (you can do it with one hand) and looks nice on the instrument.  I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I love the dial, it's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where I can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz.  Awesome product, much better than using a Kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck.  Sounds great on my SG and my acoustic.For those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough.  I think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me."
B000B6FBA2 There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better."
B000B6FBA2 This is a very nice product to use.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is small enough to be out of the way while playing."
B000B6FBA2 I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;."
B000BKY8CU I bought this bench on an Amazon Warehouse Deal so that I could get it on Prime delivery and was not disappointed at all. The bench is very sturdy and comfortable - the cushioning is thick and soft. The item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds. This bench is just what I was looking for and I'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years."
B000BKY8CU The Keyboard Bench is lower than I anticipated.  The seat is very soft and comfortable.  However, it doesn't appear to hold anyone with excess weight."
B000BKY8CU This assembled in just a couple of minutes without the need to refer to the instructions. The bench is comfortably padded and very affordable."
B000BKY8CU It isn't top of the line but it gets the job done. I wouldn't abuse of the chair too much though, the material looks a little floosy."
B000BNSYHW got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar. Nice airline-sized bottle w/ safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening. Replenished my dried out fretboard to like-new condition."
B000BNSYHW I needed some fretboard cleaner. This is something I had not tried before. I used it and I like it."
B000BNSYHW Nice quality fretboard oil. Has a nice scent to it, and remember a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this. Worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard."
B000BNSYHW I maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since I no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me! Take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy!"
B000BQTCDO I owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment.  It produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing.  The sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: \"White Room, Black Curtains\"; \"Satisfaction\"; \"Ina Gadda da Vida\".  Note:  this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack.  As such, it will not really do the \"Whole Lotta Love\" sound.  As I said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited.  If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound.  If you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect."
B000BQTCDO I cannot express how over sized this pedal is - it's ridiculously big and it's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.Again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone"
B000BQTCDO This pedal does exactly what my title suggests... it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz... very smashing pumpkins feel to this. It doesn't do many different tones, but what it does it does very well! And frankly, once I find a good tone out of a pedal, I don't change it often anyhow! This is an amazing value, and a welcome party of my pedal boards. (P.S.: I have the Russian variant...)"
B000BU5V58 Received item when promised, fits great for my Yamaha Acoustic Electric, but carry with care, remember Acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped, great zipped pockets."
B000BU5V58 This case is very durable, nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage. The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel. The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life."
B000BUDO48 I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price...I figured I'd get my money's worth from them regardless.  They work fine.  So well, that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio.  The price went up nearly 50% on them though.  BAH."
B000BUDO48 I've bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years, and I've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones, and this is the best one I've found yet. Very sturdy, well made, and fully height adjustable, with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up. It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged, so at least it lets you know that ahead of time(most cheap stands don't), so that's a good thing as well. Don't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand, grab this one!"
B000BUGNNM Case  arrived in great condition.Quite Roomy, fits my Vendetta AND/Or my Les Paul - Two exterior pockets for tools, extras, etc.2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP, but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I'm not hauling them to shows...Get One."
B000BUGNNM I have seven of these that I use on my Ibanez AM73's, but they are perfect for anyAM series guitars (like the 93).The bag is well padded, and not to expensive.It seems it is always on back order which tells me they are very popular.The dimensions are: 41\"L, 14\"W at Bout, and 3\" Deep. It has two large zippers; the head zipper goes all the wayaround, and the bout zipper stops before entering the bottom area which is the ONLY draw back to thisgig bag, as with ALL deeper guitars, you want the bottom (bout) zipper to at least complete the bottom areato make placing and removing easier.This is the best gig bag I have found in the last few years for the smaller bout guitars that does not cost too much."
B000BUGNNM This is a great bag, regardless of cost. The fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal. (Free shipping only makes it that much better.) Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed any objectionable smell. I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed. The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection. (I would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick.) In addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue. The two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch. In my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain. As it is, it's very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II."
B000BUGNNM This quality bag would probably cost more like $35+ at your local music store. Appears well made, has good padding and several pockets for strings, picks, cable, whatever. Taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell (also mentioned by other reviewers). Not terrible, but somehow chemical. Hope it goes away soon."
B000BW2D84 The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place. All you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the \" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight.As a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug.Great right?Well, not really.As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered. With the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice. In the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed.I have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around. The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but I have experienced problems in the past. Always have a few spares that have been tested.Another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient.Is it easier than soldering? Yes.Are they reliable? For the most part, yes.Will I continue using the product? Yes, because I usually have spares.Why do I use them then? I'm lazy.This is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectors:Don.t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors. The thin soft gold (5-10 microns) .flash. plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! The brass eventually  tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts.It is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket. But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs."
B000BW2D84 This is one of my favorite music purchases in a while. Cleans up your gear's appearance tremendously. Very easy to use and lots of extra cable length."
B000BWEM42 Some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit.  First of all I had to fumble around with it for almost 15 minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like I got a previously-returned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to manhandle it because I could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force.  I was about to give up but I felt bad to do the return because I didnt want to make Amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over $8 in postage to send back to them.But eventually I figured it out.  I am a 5 ft 10 inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because I opened it all the way and there was still an inch or 2 to spare if I wanted to raise it to the maximum.  Looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all 3 segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height (They probably only raised 2 out of the 3 segments).So for the price I think you get what you pay for and since I just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under 18 years old I recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order.  And then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new one.The truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk, okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care (such as myself) but not for children or drunks, it is very fragile and easy to break.  I took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you over-tighten so be very, very careful.I will keep mine but if I had to purchase a second unit I would not buy this one because I dont like flimsy junk and I feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing."
B000BWEM42 It may be a challenge to assemble it.I personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how I am wired.I am not 'good' at putting things together without help.Good product after you get it assembled.James :)"
B000BYPJ1U Its easy to set up and use. Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it. I re soak it easy 2-3 weeks or so. Can't tell if it's truly working on my maple wood ukulele."
B000BYPJ1U I like these humidifiers.  Works if you keep it with instrument in your case, and upkeep is minimal.  Work on all strings very well, but be careful, easy to fall out of case, so just be careful!"
B000BYPJ1U Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity. A must have for us dry Californians."
B000BYPJ1U I was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that I need a humidifier for my guitar. At first I was not sure what I was looking for. I found the product without too much difficulty. I had learned from my instructor that these are small, placed on the hole of the guitar, and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition. I started looking through the computer pages and settled on the Herco Guitar Humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product. Now I feel I made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations, and good music!"
B000BYPJ1U Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile. Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part. I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood. I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist. The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward. I may order another if this one performs well."
B000CBE3G4 Great slap echo sound.  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb.  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!).  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc.  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp.  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint.  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year."
B000CBE3G4 This pedal works but doesn't have the depth of echo I expected. I doesn't even come close to the same sound quality of my old Dan Echo DE-1 pedal.  That certainly explains the difference in price. You get what you pay for. I'm using it with a Fender Eighty-Five solid state amp. I tried it with other amps and it sounds the same. If you're looking for a good slap echo effect, I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE-1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo, but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal. The FAB echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it. It's just not as good as I expected. I'm sorry I bought it and I don't recommend this pedal. There are much better ones on the market. Shop around."
B000CBE3G4 this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music.the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard. but for 20 dollars its well worth the price.  this is a great product and i highly recomend it."
B000CBE3G4 I'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate: The pedal gave up the ghost (died) In a relatively short amount of time. I replaced it with  mini modtone type delay.... I actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better."
B000CBE3G4 I admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out. I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff. Anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out.You know, it is a pretty decent stompbox. The slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top....just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo...not quite delay, not quite reverb...kind of somewhere in between. I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different. Not bad at all. I cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects. For kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah....Anyway....Enjoy!"
B000CBE3G4 I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it. The sound I get with it is very, very cool. After a while it just stopped working. While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online. You can't beat the price. If it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal. All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death. An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since I could replace for $15. So I ordered another one. Definately get an adapter for this. Yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy. Just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off. Guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's. Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet. If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals...well...I'd suggest buying them by the gross. Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips. Used alone or with other effects, the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis."
B000CBE3GE It's a flange pedal, what else? For the price I was really happy with it. If I knew someone who was more skilled than me I'd get the workings inside a different case. The shape is cool, but I'd feel safer with it in a metal casing. The button is smaller than I thought, but it's not an issue at all; it's kinda easier to press!As for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals, for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm, I would recommend this!"
B000CBE3GE The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end (My fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker rattled the walls) of its sweep and can give a very cool effect. I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed. Also, the speed know has a great range with 5+ second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones. The depth knob does it's job. It doesn't have a manual knob to move the sweep, but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it's no big deal. For the price, this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp."
B000CBE3GE The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CBE3GE the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun!!! this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more! wide sweeping flange effect, great harmonics and little power useage.  well worth the investment!!!!"
B000CBXZXG My frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets. I recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright. Incredible!"
B000CBXZXG I opened the package for the first time and didn't think much of it, but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job.  Obviously, cardboard isn't going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths."
B000CBXZXG The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it."
B000CBXZXG Will this replace a pro fret job? Nah...That said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.End results[...]"
B000CCIVCA Idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. All metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand LED readouts. Runs on 2 AA batteries.Features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPyle-Pro PCT10are:-'Test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'Intermittent' issue indication - This is what made me choose this model. If there's even the shortest dropout, the LEDs indicate it. Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.My only complaints:-The a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. Quite frustrating. Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-There's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. This clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. Luckily I have no need for the clip. I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. I stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.After the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. Too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box."
B000CCJP4I fast delivery, works perfectly...I have 3 of the Danelectro effects pedals... hard to say which I prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound...I'm partial to the chorus ...good item"
B000CCJP4I It's plastic that's 1 star deduction, but in this case, very pleas
B000CCJP4I How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didn't need chorus at all. This pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. Sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. I even like it with the bass. Just a great chorus with not much to tweak."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-5 Chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals.  Cheap.  Mass-produced.  Housed in a plastic casing.  But the FAB series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more.  If this pedal cost $50, I might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9V jacks are.  I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix, Speed, and Depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch.  But at this price, for it to sound THIS good, I can't complain at all.Don't expect the FAB series to be good at everything.  But if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the FAB series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals.  It's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists."
B000CCJP4I Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings.(Think Alice in chains, or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo) admittedly not everyone's into the whole grunge tone. But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey, you can pretty much get it for pocket change."
B000CCMWVG I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices. Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price, but pleasantly surprised when we received it."
B000CCMWVG My Seagull Entourage Rustic fits very snug (I think that is a good thing, not certain) in the case which has a nice faux fur lining and seems well made.I was considering theSeagull Dreadnought Casebut there were no useful pictures or details on the item. I decided to try the Guardian and save a few bucks.Seems like I made a good choice."
B000CCMWVG my fav cases ever"
B000CD1R7K "
B000CD1R7K This thing is useless. Good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. Unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. Pass on this."
B000CD1R7K This is quality construction.  It's definitely a must.  I'm a taller guy and it's important to have proper posture for longer playing periods.  I'm glad I bought this."
B000CD1R7K I've owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one.  This one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value.I'm 6'2 and weigh 225.  There are numerous adjustment angles that I can switch to and be comfortable and I'm not concerned about the legs bending.  The photo makes them look weaker than they are."
B000CD1R84 First off, most audio racks have that annoying &#34;slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them&#34; instead of properly sized holes. Not this one. Not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them, but it even includes 48 screws so you don't have to try to figure out which of the 3 sizes you've collected over the years is going to fit.I loaded it up with equipment and haven't had a worry about it since. Solid construction and the mounting just works. This one is done right."
B000CD1R84 Simple and useful rack stand. Easy to assemble. Easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. A little more interest in the manufacture means more quality."
B000CD1R84 I use this with my mobile DJ equipment and it is fantastic. Very sturdy and light enough to easily carry. Holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation. Plastic covers on the feet came off right away though, but not really a big deal to me."
B000CD1R84 I've uploaded customer-supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is. When you factor in the price it's plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain, but a flexible platform for mounting components.One other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table-top only rack. They work very well on the floor.The rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank. I have a bass amp head and a power amp, plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that, combined, weighs around 50 pounds. The rack is not stressed or strained by this weight, and could probably hold another 50 pounds safely and reliably. Another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components, eliminating that expense (I was expecting to have to orderRaxxess Rack Screws With Washers Hardware (Pack of 25), which turned out to be completely unnecessary.)My only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off, but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem.If you need portability, reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved (such as setting up on stages) this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment. I am so pleased with mine that I intend to purchase another one, bringing the total to three."
B000CD3QY2 Sure it's a few bucks more than the standard Crybaby, but totally worth it. Built like a tank, but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings."
B000CD3QY2 Your option to change the wah configuration is amazing. Only problem is the no DC adapter included, needs buy separately."
B000CD3QY2 For years I played the original Cry baby, the Vox Wah, and others I can't remember names of. I was always on a quest for a good wah sound that I just couldn't find. I didn't want to spend $600 on a wah with a rack. So at the recomendation of a studio engineer I purchased this wah about 5 years ago. I am very pleased that I followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah I was looking for. The greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable. The user dials in the frequency sweep they want. The volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix. I recomend this wah pedal over all the others, especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking."
B000CD3QY2 This is the wah I was looking for.  Very versatile and built in boost feature is great too. buy it...you wont regret it."
B000CD3QY2 First of all, I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal. I will tell you my wah pedal story.Several years ago, I bought a Crybaby GCB-95 and, even though I did not use wah very much at the time, I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year. Fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time. Finally, I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely.A couple years ago, I bought a Digitech XP-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morello's style. Since it has some digital wah patches was available, I started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my GCB-95. The wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good.Finally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains, \"Man in the Box\" and the Digitech was just not going to cut it. So, it was time to get a real wah. I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used. I chose the 535Q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile.You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started. I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles. That setting works will in songs like RATM, \"Bulls on Parade\" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch DJ sounds.I still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs. I think that as long as I need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! It is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad."
B000CDT4VQ This is better than a gig bag, for sure, and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric. Now, it's not padded really well and doesn't look like it'll hold up for more than a few years, but it was cheap. It seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly, which is why I drop a star."
B000CZ0RHY I only use this as a tube amp for vocal.  For the price, I can drive 2 mics, and fit it in a 1U space.  The tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as I don't crank it up too much, it also helps with the gain of the SM58 as it's much lower than my other Line6 mic.  I used to have multiple  Studio Projects VTB-1s and ART Tube Pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age, and I mainly cared for the tube feature in them, so stepping down to the MIC2200 is fine with me.If you want to get warmer vocal sound, and don't want to invest too much for it, the MIC2200 is the way to go, imo.  However, buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers (and hope that they last).  So I'll update should I encounter problems."
B000CZ0RHY Don't like that it's difficult to change the tube.  Sound quality was not what I expected, maybe because I wasn't familiar with the settings.  No power cord was included in mine or manual.  Manual should have been include not sure about the cord.  Dials are very small.  My MIC200 and MIC800 are much better than this.  I can't say it's bad.  Just that there are better choices in my opinion."
B000E0PPG0 no problem...it came today like the computer said it would... the box was mint...to my surprise there wasn't even any tape on it... I opened it ... pulled it from its plastic sleeve and set it up on about a minute it was holding a speaker cab...thanks again Amazon....and why would I shop any where else?"
B000E0PPG0 I only needed one, I haven't use it, but I'm sure it's going to work well. This is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on top.ffsalsa"
B000EEEYCW This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner.  The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though.  But maybe that saves on battery life.  I don't know.  It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking.I'm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitar/bass and not the chromatic one."
B000EEEYCW Wonderful to use - as soon as I put the batteries in and started even without reading the directions - easy"
B000EEEYCW Had to return the first one.  Second is holding it's own.  Just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic.  Spot on when used correctly inline with cables."
B000EEGAJW i bought these because i couldn't see spending $4.50 a dozen at the local music store. I figure 12 dozen will last me for years. Get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like I can easily do."
B000EEGAJW I have used Fender Thin 351 picks for 40 years but always in either solid black or swirl brown. These picks are great because when you drop them on stage or in a dark club you can find them easily."
B000EEGAJW Great heavy picks, amazingly cheap price.  You really can't go wrong.  I lose my picks continually (Bermuda Triangle in my Laundry?), and this has been great to have an endless supply..."
B000EEHCUS These strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips...They are very light to play and make my practising easier whille Iconcentrate on building callouses  ; )"
B000EEHD4I even though i ordered large...still not fitting...will do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fit...i do not have giant hands so large should fit...but not this...very well made...heavy if thats what your looking for...arrived on time..but...good luck"
B000EEHD4I After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a Dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for \"Spanish style\" playing), I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide.  It's probably a personal issue, but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide.  The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide.  The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control.  This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it.  The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses.  Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I drop it.  In short:  it's a winner."
B000EEHDIE I got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. That is a record. The tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. It is the sound that I like though."
B000EEHJS8 It is very easy to apply, great results and very little effort. I'm surprised by the results. Never got this shine in my guitar with any other product."
B000EEHJS8 I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars I've been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles. I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax, you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also. I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply.Along with a few high end guitars, I also have a few beaters. I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic. fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great.I use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly, I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease. I will buy this stuff again and again, my local guitar shop sells this for the same price."
B000EEHKVY My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up smaller, but otherwise this is an excellent stand. I have to concede I'm a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myK & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand. However that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build. The extra heft of the Hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand (the K&M; tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor). Despite not folding up quite as small, the Hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust (one action for legs, one action for height, whereas the K&M; has three separate legs and two vertical sections / clamps). I do realize that I bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the K&M.; Length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the K&M; (large enough that I won't try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as I do the K&M;).I'm also not convinced Hercules' trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand. The back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it's knock the whole stand over. No big deal, just more parts (and weight). I think I prefer K&M;'s yoke, as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied. The Hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting \"gates\". Both work perfectly well with my Fender and similar bass head stocks.I've had two of the K&M;'s and the second was a bit of a disaster. It was defective in more than two areas. Defects happen, but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit, and lead me to try the Hercules(I won't go into all of that here, see my review on that product). Aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke, the Hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness. I'm glad I purchased this one and I think I'll get plenty of use from it. But I should mention, it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the K&M;, mainly its awesome portability (despite its slightly more fragile nature).In the interest of further comparison, I've got anUltimate  GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Standon order, and will review it against this and the K&M; as well. I opted for the GS-100 without an automatic closing mechanism over the GS-1000 which has one for the reasons I stated above- I don't believe it is strictly necessary. The reviews of the GS100 are also more favorable, and the GS100 is cheaper (which suits my cheapness."
B000EEHKVY This is hands down the best guitar stand on the market. It will last a lifetime and never drop your axe. I have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and I love them all!"
B000EEHMXA I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. I'm hoping they last a while!"
B000EEHMXA I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin, and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings.  I put these on, and what a difference.  These aren't too heavy, not too light.  They ring nicely.  I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings."
B000EEHMXA The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments.  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound.  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier.  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down.  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new.  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively.  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins.  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops.  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work.  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance."
B000EEHMXA Quality strings at a very affordable price.  They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product."
B000EEHN9S This is the stand you remember from the band room. Effective, and built like a tank. You will need a wrench to assemble (a very simple task). One note - the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring, invest in the optional foot covers if you're concerned."
B000EEHN9S this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars, this will last a life time, and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily,,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash,, so i looked for something better and ,i am so happy to have found this , at this price.i didn't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand ,but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash ,i would be buying another one , so really ,this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you can't go wrong with this one,,,REALY !! get it !  it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over,its heavy enough not to, it slides up and down nicely, and the book shelf  tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well, .,bolts are NOT plastic,witch is nice,,and very easy to put together and fast,,i got it together in one minute,i only used regular pliers to put it together..  the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument,i truly recommend this for anyone  ! (i did get the foot guards for $1.95 to protect floor, on carpet you will not need them ,)and it comes with a 10 year warranty ,and with the free shipping you can't beet it,"
B000EEJ8IM Good cheap basic metal slide, sounds like it should. Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands (viz XL and XXL gloves) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger. A bit annoying but not the slide's fault I guess!"
B000EEJ8IM I lost my trusty slide and really miss it. The Dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but, it does sound sweet. If it was just a bit smaller diameter, that would do the trick. My old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so, a brand-new, sleek fit isn't a plus in my case. The Dunlop is well made, as expected. It's just not the Antiques Roadshow model I had in mind. Hmmm, might be a new product idea - rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name."
B000EEJ8IM I am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide.  this one works fine so far.  it is rather heavy and I like that.  I also like that because it is metal, if you drop it on the floor, it is not going to break like my glass one did.  Be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however.  otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger."
B000EEJ8IM Fast delivery, and exactly as advertised.  Put it to work making music within minutes.  The steel gives a clearer sound than the glass  bottle slides,  but you need both.  Good product."
B000EEJ8IM I did purchase 3 diferent slides this one is mark as a medium but is diferent size from the other one's what I ordered. Perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size . This is why I give only 3 stars because is to small for me."
B000EEJ8IM Well i got this after hearing seasick steve its cool i havent figured it out just yet but its a very good product"
B000EEJ8IM Great sounding slider for my electric AND it won't shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do. Plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action. It has a great sound for the modern electric guitars, but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances. I recommend."
B000EEJ8IM I have several different slides (glass, brass, steel, short, long, etc.)And this has become my go to for every slide guitar session I play on!I wear it on my ring finger, It fits great, the tone is amazing on acoustic, electric and banjo!Works great for blues, rock, a little stoner country, and even some metal! (the main genres I play in)Harmonics and sustain to spare!I keep it in my pocket at all times now, it goes with me everywhere, And has never failed to lay down some mojo when I bring it out!"
B000EEJ8IM This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old."
B000EEJAFS I love these picks, especially in this gauge. They are a bit thinner than the jazz 3s, so if you master em, you can in theory, play faster ;) They have a good grip, and a nice texture. The tone it gives isn't bad either."
B000EEJAFS Black Tortex picks with silver lettering.The Jazz picks are about 25% smaller than standard Tortex picks and have a more pronounced point."
B000EEJAFS I've been using Dunlap's Tortex picks now for going on 10 years, and recently just switched over to heavy Jazz picks (smaller - sharper tip). These picks work great. They provide enough surface area that they won't slip easily from between your fingers. They allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them. Any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use. I also prefer the high thickness so there's no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure you're putting on the strings."
B000EEJAFS If you like Jazz Guitar picks and if you like Tortex picks this is the perfect marriage.  These are the best.  Enjoy."
B000EEJAFS I've been a Jazz III fan since 1997 starting with the red (too buttery and rounded sounding) and then moving to the black (durable but a bit tubby sounding). Eventually I tried a 1.0mm Tortex of this pick which had good attack but was somewhat mushy sounding through amp sims.But then I tried this .60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups. More mids, more attack, faster attack, scratchier attack, and less lows. Now you'd think this would make your guitar sound thin, and indeed it sounds thinner but also clearer by a factor of two.Thus when recording through amp sims, you get a clearer more dynamic more attack-ish sound. When using the 1.0mm the fundamental was a bit too strong which made for a mushy amp sim sound, but this .60mm did the trick. It just sounds heavier, tighter, and more articulate. While it does wear faster, for recording purposes it's my current ultimate pick of choice.So if your guitar doesn't sound clear, articulate, or aggressive enough first give this pack of picks a shot. But you don't have to take my word for it... da-nehh-nan!"
B000EEJAWQ I like them but I love the Schaller locks more. They don't feel as secure as the Schaller locks. Sorry"
B000EEJAWQ I use these on all my guitars.  Love them.  Easy to assemble and use.  If you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  Once installed they are fantastic."
B000EEJE4K I wear a large sized glove, so assuming that would translate, I got these.  While I can force it over my thumb, it is very tight and uncomfortable (i.e., pinches).  My thumbs don't have a particularly excessive diameter either.  I'm gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit.  I know they need to be snug so the pick doesn't rotate when being used, but this is ridiculous.  Three stars because if they fit you, it is a nice pick (it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing)."
B000EEJF4O I have a gibson les paul that I bought used. When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry. I first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood). So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey.I ordered it and applied it.  A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt. I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry. I decided to give it another 24 hours.The next day the guitar neck looked and played great. It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ. Bends and slides are smoother than ever.Great product and one that I will continue to use. If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly. But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation."
B000EEJF4O This treatment, after I let it soak in for 24 hours, made my fingerboard look great and play fast. A little goes a long way!"
B000EEJF4O As I mentioned in my review about guitar polish (already forgot what kind), I'm not really a guitar polish connoisseur, but this makes my fingerboards feel real good.  It got rid of that scratchy feeling when I bent strings, dissolved the crud, and makes the fretboard look just lovely.  It probably works as a fine hand conditioner too, but who can say.  Again, because I'm rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing, this bottle will also last me years."
B000EEJF4O Works as advertised.  Makes the fretboard look and feel nice! I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you're changing your strings."
B000EEJF4O I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics. They had mimimal oil/stain from the factory.  Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks.  I use it every other time I restring my guitars, It is a really good product, I use it on all of my guitars, except my Strat that has a maple neck.."
B000EEJF4O I bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after 2 uses, the wood looks great again. I used the honey twice in 2 days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition.This honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier. I saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after I bought this, but I do not use it much so it should last a long time."
B000EEJF4O I have a lot of high end instruments, and I live in New England so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.This stuff is fantastic - MUCH better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. An hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. I apply it on occasion with the strings on (I use Elixirs) and have never once had a problem.The best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 Stars."
B000EEJJ5Y This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious."
B000EEJJ5Y this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach"
B000EEJJI6 This is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos, and you get free shipping.Yeah, it's not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones, but still not bad; better than an elastic strap type.It is also great for creating your own short cut and drop D capos.  With a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff.Do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin. You can add a pad of some sort, or just take care to not to over-tighten it.I'm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through.  So, far it doesn't look like it will though."
B000EEJJI6 This works with equal ease across all six strings, or only the bottom three.  Haven't run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet. But judging by its performance on the bottom three, and its fierce grip, it'll do just fine."
B000EEJJI6 It'll do for setup work, and the price is right. I wouldn't recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song, its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set. I also wouldn't recommend it for anyone just starting out. A spring clamp type capo would serve better. This one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it, and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up."
B000EEJJI6 works like it is suppose to, good quality.I am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song.Thank You Kyser Capos"
B000EEJJI6 Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews:--I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything.--The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo."

B0063BGBO4 Something is seriously wrong with the first half, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it is- it's incredibly boring due to being plotless.  It's about a group of middle aged party animals that reunite for a weekend (or week) of heavy fun, drugs and drinking but... for over an hour, that's *all* they do.  This might be fun for them but certainly not for us, the viewers.  They drink and do all kinds of drugs, they roll down hills, they drive fast cars, they simply party without taking a break while reminiscing about old times and past girlfriends.However the second half... wow, now *that's* what I call an improvement!  A drastically different turn of events, in fact.  When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are- storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when classic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one."
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's I MELT WITH YOU is less a traditional narrative film and something more experimental; something more akin to a visual performance piece and not necessarily so much about the plot or dialogue. However, that's not to say that dialogue or plot don't exist. They're there and they're strong, and as far as performance is concerned, this ensemble is pretty impressive.Richard the writer (the always excellent Thomas Jane), Ron the financier (the terrific Jeremy Piven), Jonathan the doctor (The mostly under-appreciated Rob Lowe) and Timothy the question mark(the completely unknown Christian McKay) are four old college friends now all at 44 years of age who made a pact to meet up every year for a Spring Break getaway from family and work and all the pleasures/stresses those cause and have a week together in their own private Land-Of-Do-As-You-Please. Multiple glasses of alcohol are ingested. A smorgasbord of drugs are swallowed, snorted, inhaled and injected, partially as a gift from Jonathan the doctor. Richard brings some human party favors in young nubile female and male company (included is former adult star turned serious actress Sasha Grey). 80's Music is played constantly and loudly. They laugh as they reminisce and there is the sensation of freedom from the reality of their current lives, but it's exceedingly short-lived. Richard is a former writer-turned-teacher and serial womanizer; Ron is happily married with a great family but his financial shortcuts are catching up to him; Jonathan is wholly disillusioned with his profession and has reduced to selling fake painkiller prescriptions as well as being a divorcee with a young son who calls his step-father \"daddy\" now; Timothy is still grieving over the loss of his boyfriend 5 years prior.This week will be very different than the 22 that preceded it, though, and it will not end well for any of them.Things start out amicably enough, but as the week progresses, the group spirals out of control and a descent into what some might consider drug-addled madness but is actually something deeper and more meaningful for the four of them. Things become even more tense when the local town sheriff (the very talented and lovely Carla Gugino) begins to suspect there are darker things going on at the house these men have rented for the week.Mark Pellington, best-known for the dour domestic terrorism thriller ARLINGTON ROAD, goes back to his roots as a music-video director (where he is best known for the unforgettable video for Pearl Jam's haunting \"Jeremy\")as peppered generously throughout the film are brief flashes of the past, present and future, and meditative shots of the water, sand and rocks that surround their rented house in Monterey which is more evocative of Terrence Malick's work. It's an odd mix of smash-cut editing and longer and more visually arresting takes, and it's as disorienting as the constant haze of drugs and alcohol our characters are in.This film does suffer at times from what have come to be referred to around the internet as \"First World Problems\"; which is essentially a bunch of good-looking white men sit around a campfire and complain about their sex lives, their lack of wealth, and how unsatisfying their future is from how they were as kids. That was a big problem for me with Lisa Chodolenko's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but these problems become alternately more and less significant as the film reaches its second act where a drastic, desperate and tragic act leads these men to re-evaluate their problems against the vow they made to one another all those years ago. The whole rest of the film hinges on the importance of this vow, but the vow remains non-specific (but implied) until the very end.Aside from Pellington's expert use of the visual style in this film, the performances from the leads are range from very solid to downright awesome. Jane is absolutely mesmerizing in this film, as is Piven. Their characters really have the heavy lifting to do from a dramatic standpoint and they carry the emotional core of the film effortlessly. Both McKay and Lowe do very solid work here, but sadly their characters feel somewhat short-changed with the prominence of Jane and Piven. Gugino unfortunately has little to do, but is utterly convincing when she's doing it. The various supporting characters, such as Tom Bower playing an ancient mariner and the aforementioned Grey playing a somewhat spiritual and redemptive madonna/whore type have even less to do, other than spout some wisdom or forgiveness.It's definitely not a film not for everyone. While having a linear narrative, it still may be somewhat troublesome for a more literal-minded viewer. Personally, while being a somewhat upsetting and nihilistic film (something Jane seems to do very well: see THE MIST), it's also a very powerful and beautiful film about bonds that stretch across the years and the promises we make to our friends. The symbolism can get a little too heavy-handed and ham-fisted occasionally, but the rest of the film makes up for that.Also, killer soundtrack."
B0063ONN9C My toddler says bubba ga (bubble guppies) within 10 feet of seeing a tv. He loves all of the singing, Its educational so why not, 3rd season here we come"
B0064JGWZS This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it."
B0064JGWZS Finally the technical problems are resolved!SPOILERS:Chaos reigns in Hell on Wheels. Just desserts are delivered to the Swede. Rewards and loses come to others. While Bohannan's guilt and rage lead him to go too far."
B0064JGWZS You know, I've got my Dad to thank for getting me into Westerns. Starting out with the likes of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, going onto John Wayne and onto shows like The Lone Ranger-The Rifleman and then onto Gunsmoke-Wild Wild West and the like. I'vw watched them pretty much all my life and enjoy them very much. Heck, a time or two- I've even picked novels by Louis Lamour-Robert B. McNeill-Zane Grey and others and read them. I guess a part of me wishes I existed during them days so I could roam the plains and see the beautiful splendor of the outdoors. Anyhow, because of my love for Westerns, I happen to be talking to a friend one day about viewing Streets of Loredo recently. I told him how I enjoyed it but couldn't find any new Westerns out there that I hadn't already seen at some point(I am 45 years old, mind you). He recommended Hell On Wheels. The only thing he really told me about it was that it took place after the Civil War and that it involved the building of the transcontinental railroad. I was somewhat reluctant on getting it. Then, one day, my better half and I were renting a movie from Redbox when I'd seen the first five episodes available on DVD...so, I gave it a shot.It goes alot deeper than my friends' initial description of the show. It centers on a Confederate soldier who's out to exact revenge on the Union soldiers who murdered his wife. He ends up following their trail to the traveling town of, you guessed it, Hell On Wheels.The First Season does have its' moments but, for the most part, is a hard-hitting Western series that fans of Deadwood and the like will love.  If you'll notice, reviewers(inlcluding me) keep bringing up Deadwood. The reason is the show is well-written, the characters grow on you and it always keeps you coming back."
B0064JGWZS Interesting idea.  There are a lot of positives -- modern take on a western, shows some of the US expansion following the Civil War.  Good start."
B0064JGWZS I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show."
B0064JGWZS I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda. Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain. Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing--but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad (along with Poles, Italians, Swedes and Germans) with arrogant &#34;in-your-face&#34; Farrakhan blacks. The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned. I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula &#34;White/Black/Female&#34; second season."
B0064JGWZS I have read all the reviews here at Amazon about Hell On Wheels.  Most people get all defensive and say it's just \"deadwood light\" or something along those lines.  Admittedly, I have never seen Deadwood, so I don't know if these two are similar or not.  What I can tell you is this; I've read the show summary for Deadwood and I've watched Hell On Wheels.  Just from what I've read about Deadwood, it's nothing like Hell On Wheels as far as show plot.  Deadwood is mostly about general western reenactment and everyday life in what the real wild west would've been like.  Although I am sure there are alot of similarities in how the shows look and feel, Hell On Wheels differs in alot of ways.  Hell On Wheels is a modern day western show about building a railroad in the west, which sets it apart from Deadwood.  I've not read anything remotely close to that in the reviews for Deadwood.  In fact, the only real influence from Deadwood that makes it onto Hell On Wheels is some vague character similarities.With all of that being said, I'm not even gonna mention Deadwood at length anymore.  I'm not interested in that show.  I am, however, a big fan of Hell On Wheels.  It's a unique concept that has great plots and well-defined characters that makes this show compelling television.  From Cullen Bohannon to Thomas Durante to Robert Bell and his wife[forgetting her name] to Ferguson[Common's character].  All of these individuals make for intriguing on-screen dynamics with multiple implications and story plots that make you truly appreciate the effort AMC gave this show.  It's something that definetely stands out in AMC's television show lineup and something any casual western lover would enjoy.  And unlike old school westerns, Hell On Wheels has a consistent pace with a great story that does not drag on or dance around the point.  It's simple, straightforward storytelling that speaks for itself and goes directly at the audience.  Also unlike normal western television Hell On Wheels is not too dark.  It has elements of realism in its portrayal and is dark but not so much so that it looks gloomy[as Deadwood seems just by initial appearance].  Hell On Wheels has humorous moments while also remaining true to how a real western railroad work crew camp would look & feel like.  Just watching the bonus features on how they made the look of the show proves how much effort the show creators took into recreating authenticity.  To me, Hell On Wheels is a unique show that may take elements from past shows or westerns, but also stands on its own as completely different entity to itself.  It's not \"deadwood light\" or anything else in my opinion.  It is Hell On Wheels, a great show that deserves to be on television for awhile if the show keeps a consistency to it and doesn't overdo it or overexaggerate.  I could see this show lasting for at least 5 seasons or better if done right."
B0064JGWZS Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!"
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing."
B0064JGWZS This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting."
B0064JGWZS I loved this series on AMC! I preorder this as soon as it became available. It does suck one of my friends that played a Native American on the show had to get killed put it is what it is. If you haven't seen it.. do! It's really great! Highly recommend!"
B0064JGWZS I admit i wasnt blown away by first episode, but it certainly builds over the season into a great show."
B0064JGWZS Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  My wife doesn't usually go for Westerns but she thoroughly enjoed this production.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly."
B0064JGWZS Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book \"Nothing Like It in the World\", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly \"The Swede\" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!"
B0064JGWZS I had not previously seen Hell on Wheels so ordered just Season 1 DVD'[s.  Loved it, and will probably obtain other Seasons."
B0064JGWZS In comparison with much of what is available in the way of westerns, this is a minimally acceptable series.  The plot is interesting, the actors moderately competent, and the set designs and photography convincing.  Obviously, this series is a milksop imitation of Deadwood.  Deadwood was a ten; Wheels is a five.  Unforgivably, the depictions of Native American culture are offensive.  Such caricatures would be expected in a 1940's John Wayne oater but are both atavistic and ridiculous in modern productions.Still, there is enough of interest in Wheels to warrant viewing (if nothing better is available and one is relatively desperate for escapism)."
B0064YPHEK Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature."
B0064YPMOU One of the best documentaries on the Vietnam War.  Extensive coverage, thoughtful interviews and good footage.  The editing was better than I expected.  Overall, outstanding."
B0064YPMOU This is an older program that aired some time back.  It provides a good and accurate summary of the history and politics of the Vietnam war."
B0064YPMOU Well written and documented with very good images.  It took me back to 1969 very quickly and my time there."
B00669UD0Q It focuses on a group of people who hike into the mountains and find a young girl buried under the ground... alive... they dig her out and try to get her to safety... TRY is the key word... someone is hunting them."
B0066SB8UQ keep the story  going  the rumor is your going to end the show after this season. that would be less than smart"
B0066SB8UQ Ragnar, brother of Queen Iolande of Betrassus, has received a red ring as a result of his fury and jealousy at his sister's being chosen as a Green Lantern. Now the crew of the Interceptor must return to Betrassus and stop him. Meanwhile, all is not well among the on Oa. Apa, leader of the Guardians of the Universe, is determined to take down Ganthet (voiced by the late Ian Abercrombie, to whom the episode is dedicated) for embracing a \"base emotion\". Determined to help Hal Jordan and his friends, Ganthet reveals that he placed a \"protoype\" on the Interceptor before its departure based on the interaction between willpower and that \"base emotion\"...hope.The mythology of the Green Lantern comics is at its strongest in this episode, as is the quality of the show as a whole. New plot threads are added to the ever-expanding storyline of the series. The stage is set for yet another Lantern Corps to enter the mix. And the war with the Red Lanterns grows even more serious and deadly. It would appear that this season is building towards quite an exciting climax."
B0068ZCCA2 I've seen several seasons of survivor.  This season was the most unsuspecting, full of surprise episodes.  Fabio's win was a perfect play using the &#34;below the radar&#34; technique.  The characters played well.  Some over played, and some simply quit playing.  Age did not matter.  All in all, Fabio's last 3 immunity wins played a factor in winning the game."
B0068ZCCA2 If you like watching people succeed at their lowest common denominator this season is for you.  There veiled bigotry, thievery, childish behavior, and selfishness.  The hungrier the contestants got the meaner they got with each other.  The black girl was an embarrassment to her race.  The old guy did nothing to assist his team in getting any rewards but he felt that he should have gone to the final three.  The nice guy would have finished last in a real life survivor situation but this case he didn't finish at all."
B0068ZCCA2 I really love the Survivor series. I like how they switched up the tribes; older and younger. It's kind of unfair to separate young vs. old but Survivor isn't about being fair and it was entertaining to watch."
B0068ZCCA2 This is the first season of survivor my GF and I have ever watched, so we actually wanted to give the show five enthusiastic stars because survivor rocks. Now that we have seen some of the other classic, more widely beloved seasons we think that three stars is a better review of Nicaragua. I don't want to give away spoilers but some of the contestants don't seem like they really want to be there, the strategy is pretty pathetic for survivor standards, and the weather is rainy for pretty much the whole season which doesn't bother me on my couch too much but it was pretty draining for the contestants."
B0068ZCCA2 Always enjoy watching survivor. Jeff has kept the adventures intriguing. Recommend all seasons that are currently available. Watch and enjoy."
B0068ZCCA2 I will always give survivor 5 stars! I am a fan since the very first season like a lot of people! Some seasons are better than others but I have never found a season I didn't like!"
B0068ZCCA2 Watchable, adequately entertaining, recycled challenges.  Players were not especially appealing and I never developed even a remote favorite.  Several players were so annoying that I wished I could have voted them off myself.  The three finalists?  Ho-hum.  Cinematography was well done and Jeff was more animate than usual."
B0068ZCCA2 I haven't watched Survivor much because it seems to bring out the worst in people.  Did make an exception and watched this season to see if anything had changed and was glad to see that the most deserving person won.  Congrats to all the survivors and well played."
B006DUK1K0 ... it is not totally surprising that life in a brothel at the turn of the century was no bed of roses (or in any brothel today except maybe the Nevada houses which seem to always have a camera trained on the smiling whores), but the depiction of a lady's first encounter with sadism is shocking, and the mood pervades the rest of the flick. The symbolic &#34;emerald&#34; is confusing."
B006DUK1K0 This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time."
B006DUK6SM Ordinarily in a movie filled with grief, such as this one, there is some teaching moment - something that saves it from the pit of despair.  Now I realize that isn't life.  Life hands us grief - or, more times than not, we make our own.  I does not hand us an 'Ah Ha!' moment.  Many times movies try to do that - it doesn't here.  It leaves every individual to find their own reason based on the surface look of a mix of characters.  In other words - it's filmed grief of flawed individuals that unfortunately produced a child.  They are so absorbed by their own flaws that they really fail this child from the moment of conception.  Maybe that's the teaching moment.  It doesn't matter how much you love something or someone; if you don't pay real attention to anyone besides yourself - you will eventually call it guilt."
B006FTBWXY Great show, the old man and Chumley are hillarious. I like the crew and I have learned a lot about what to look for at yard sales and thrift stores."
B006FTBWXY the store receives some pawns that are old, artistic, motorhead, canons, vintage guns and much ..much more..it's nice to see some comedic interactions with store workers also.."
B006FTBWXY Here is a vidio set that is so neat to think history is still in the hands of folks that don't always know what they have.  Fun and a great way to discover things about history you may have never known."
B006FTBWXY A lot of set-ups, but that's OK. Takes all kinds to make the world go around. Like to see it in person."
B006FTBWXY Addictive show and a huge hit now. You really learn interesting tidbits about old merchandise and historic pieces. And with money involved, it keeps you watching. I will say the current seasons are coming up with more nonsense with the crew. Very pre-scripted stuff. Many items brought in lately are guns and books. I prefer movie props myself."
B006FTBWXY The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television."
B006FTBWXY We love watching this show. You learns something new about antiques and see what people have collected in their attics or cellars ~ that are worth some money! Makes you wish you'd kept some of those old items you tossed years ago :)"
B006FYDKMA Great way to pick up on some history and american culture.  This show will make you a better negotiator at yard sales."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have great personalities and in-depth knowledge of antique junk! It's a junk history lesson on things I have thrown away. It's easy to get hooked on these episodes."
B006FYDKMA Ride again!You just can't go wrong with these guys, (and gals...).  Okay, I take issue with some of his motorcycle &#34;expertise&#34;, (having ridden and worked on / for the Big Twin for most of my life), but it's STILL one of the original and best series of it's kind available today."
B006FYDKMA I just get a kick out of watching these guy come up with treasures out of junk heaps.  They seem to have a knack for finding some real unusual characters along the way too.  I recommend this show to anyone."
B006FYDKMA Am always entertained at their ability to talk prices down, But am always educated as to history of antiques and the such. Love their chemistry and the occasional danielle pick."
B006FYDKMA Never get tired of seeing what they will find next on their trail for the next great collectible.  Their searches for stuff is fun to watch...almost like an antique scavenger hunt!  As a collector myself with over 500 advertising signs and other collectibles, I can appreciate their enthusiasm for the &#34;hunt&#34; ... just don't come to my house looking for stuff!"
B006GM4K2A This is by far my favorite Disney show.  I think it is very imaginative and smart.  My wife and I like it just as much as the kids do."
B006H0602Y When I was 21, I worked in a convenience store.  No, I know what you're thinking, but that wasn't the impressive part.  While I was working there, one night a guy came in and asked me if I wanted to manage a rock band.  How could I say, \"No\"?OK; so I wasn't going to manage that band per se.  I was going to be a roadie.  Whatever.  But just like the lead in this film -- Ron Eldard, who plays his part perfectly with a bittersweet edge -- I sucked it up and I setup and I tore down equipment nightly, for the betterment of the band.  And Rock And Roll.I should have seen the writing on the wall when, one night, most of the guitarist's equipment was stolen from the back of The Van.  (And no, I wasn't at fault on that one.  I don't even think that I was important enough to have keys to The Van.)  But it gets worse.  Since I played guitar at the time, he asked me if he could use my equipment that night.  I said, \"Sure!\" which was really stupid, but it didn't work out as poorly as it could have.  At least neither my Wa-Wa nor Chorus pedal were stolen that night.But my final paycheck from the band bounced, which was surely a bummer, and that's how it became \"final.\"  I worked really hard for that money; surely harder than the band ever did.  I knew that they probably weren't going anywhere, based upon the fact that they were a local band, and based upon the fact that they mostly played Frat parties, and further based upon the fact that they weren't as well known as Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).Now, if you were a metalhead from that era, you surely had the opinion that BOC was borderline lame.  You had Ozzy Ozbourne, who had the great Randy Rhoads on guitar.  (Check out the scene where our protagonist is going back into his bedroom for the first time in many years.  An iconic picture of Mr. Rhoads playing his iconic flying-V is hanging on the wall.  Now there was a guitarist!  Unlike that hack guitarist from BOC, whoever he was.)  And you had bands such as Judas Priest and The Scorpions, who could go all cow-bell all over BOC.  Even on the worst of nights.I did find it interesting that the writer and director chose to go with BOC as the band-that-never-appears here.  Whatever.  That was fine.  Maybe they just paid a small royalty to use the name?  (And surely that royalty was small.)  Perhaps they wanted to use a lame band since our protagonist could be called -- and I apologize -- somewhat lame, even though he is very sympathetic.  But the band itself doesn't matter, as I give nothing away as I say that the movie begins with the protagonist being fired, via phone call, from the band that he \"manages,\" err, \"roadies\" for.There are quite a few themes going on here, but one of them surely is \"looking back, nothing was ever as good as it seemed.\"  Just by looking in his eyes, you can tell that the protagonist realizes all that he's missed out on in life by pursuing his dreams, dreams that surely never materialized.  But his \"friends\" -- they were more like \"frenemies\" -- regret their lives as well, as they believe that maybe he lived a better life than they ever did.  Well, they're both wrong of course, as all of their lives were perhaps just ordinary.Not to give anything else away, but maybe instead of trying to be a rock star, one should simply be happy with the simple things in life, such as being a gardener?  That might be the real moral of the story as the credits roll.  And perhaps, \"I need more cowbell -- AND more films like 'Roadie.'\"  A pretty big recommendation on a film that brought back many memories, at least for me."
B006H0602Y By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSJimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) has been living his dream for over 20 years. He has been a roadie for Blue Oyster Cult. The key words are \"has been.\" Blue Oyster Cult has quit filling large arenas and have cut back on equipment and personnel. Jimmy is a victim of that downsizing.Since Jimmy doesn't have any other skill sets he limps back home to his mother.He hasn't seen her or talked to her since his father died. She is developing Dementia. The band continues to tour in South America but Jimmy's repeated calls go unanswered.After seeing what has happened to his mom he makes up a more successful Jimmy. He says he's become the band's manager, even produced and written some songs for them and is simply visiting before he must get on the road again because, \"they are lost without him.\"Downtrodden he walks into town to get a drink. There he becomes reacquainted with his longtime nemesis Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) who has inherited his dad's car lot and married the girl, Nikki (Jill Hennessy) who Jimmy uses to pine for. I should say still pines for.The problem is Jimmy never grew up. He still harbours the regrets and frustrations that he's carried with him. The road was the only thing that gave him a feeling of normal ... his only true home. Now he's forced to make a life changing decision - either step up, tell the truth and take on the responsibility of his ailing mother or continue to live a lie.This is a neat little drama filled with great music."
B006H0602Y Ron Eldard and the rest of the cast have a great movie here. So typical and excellent script. All the characterizations are dead-on."
B006H0602Y Blue Oyster Cult was/is a Long Island rock band that peaked in the mid-70's with the classic \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" In this indi-drama, Ron Eldard (\"Super 8\") plays Jimmy, a roadie on their tour for the past 20 some years.  For reasons unexplained, he is fired, by telephone no less.  With no job, no money and no prospects he decides to go to the house where he grew up in Queens, N. Y.  His mother (veteran actress Lois Smith), hardly recognizes him.  Except for one day when his father died, Jimmy hadn't been back since he first left home and went on tour.While sipping a cocktail at a local saloon, Jimmy runs into an old high school nemisis (Bobby Cannavale) and his wife and Jimmy's former girlfriend (Jill Hennessy).  Nikki (Hennessy) is a struggling solo artist, but seems happy in her life which includes singing before 30 or 40 people.  We can pretty much see where this is all heading but, it really doesn't.  Although Nikki does stop by Jimmy's house and visits his old bedroom which his mother had kept intact (complete with vinyl albums and a working turntable), their high school memories are just that.There really isn't much of a story here.  The actors do their part well, but they don't have much to work with.  Although a night out with plenty of booze and cocaine produces an opportunity to let loose, the story peters out the next day.  In addition to some fine performances, the soundtrack should satisfy most from this rock and roll generation.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is fine if unspectacular.  A bit soft here and there but nothing problematic.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is solid especially with the dialog.  I guess I was expecting a bit more with the musical influences.  Again, not necessarily of concern."
B006H0602Y Thoughtful and well-written.Thought provoking.  Opportunities, choices, consequences. It's strange to think that the decisions  made before age 25, when we are all impaired with an undeveloped brain, directs the course of our adult  lives. It's frightening to realize that our  immature self with no life experience or health insurance, focused on wine, women & song,  is choosing our life path .  No wonder we wake up at 40, 50, or 60 dissatisfied and paniced.  The dream we followed was that of a child, using the experience, knowledge, and education of a child to dictate our lives in retirement. How does that make sense? How does the 15 year old self, dreaming of being a Rock star,  playing air guitar to the radio  in his parents  home rent free, occasionally hitting them up for gas/grass money , possibly know  enough or have enough skills to make life decisions?  Thank goodness  for social security  and Medicare!"
B006H0602Y Roadie (2011) tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown, after being unceremoniously fired from his job of twenty plus years, as a roadie for the rock band Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).  It's a poignant look at the past and the present, as pride prevents the rocker from telling the truth about his situation, to his mother, and those he grew up with.  While the characters might seem a bit clich&eacute;d and stereotyped, when put together they complement each other, and seem to belong to the same universe.  Familiarity with the music featured in the film is not essential, but adds greatly to its impact.Jimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) arrives at his childhood home in Forrest Hills, New York, and instead of telling his mother (Lois Smith) that he has been fired, he claims to be the manager for Blue Oyster Cult, and is visiting before the band leaves on a tour of South America.  Jimmy repeatedly calls and leaves messages for someone named \"Bobby\", in connection with his situation, but never receives a return call.In a bar, Jimmy runs into Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale), a guy that tormented him in high school, who dredges up unpleasant memories, when he uses the nickname \"Jimmy Testicles\".  Randy now owns a car dealership, and his wife Nikki (Jill Hennessy), was once Jimmy's girlfriend.  Nikki sings and plays guitar, and is at the bar warming up for a performance that night.  Continuing the lie, the couple are suitably impressed by Jimmy's \"success\", as manager and contributing songwriter for BOC.With posters of Phil Lynott and Randy Rhodes on the wall, Jimmy and Nikki listen to the music of the Good Rats, as they reminisce in his bedroom, which has been preserved like a shine by Jimmy's mom.  Later Jimmy is picked up by Randy, and is taken to a motel, where Nikki is getting ready for her show.  Fueled by music, alcohol, and cocaine, what starts out as a fun time headbanging to BOC's \"See You In Black\", later turns ugly, as old demons resurface, and feelings are hurt.Directed and co-written by Michael Cuesta (Homeland, Dexter), Roadie is a \"little\" movie that may not fully resonate with those who don't have the life experiences to appreciate some of its nuances, but most can relate to some of the basic themes being examined.  Jimmy's embarrassment is completely understandable, and his deception is like a sitcom clich&eacute;, where a boast or prank goes too far.  Peter on the Brady Bunch claiming to know Joe Namath, is just one of many examples.  In this case however, things feel more real, as matters don't play out as silly harmless fun, with several allusions to much darker possibilities.Ron Eldard (Sleepers) is perfect as a burned out rocker still trying to cling to the ways of his youth.  Waxing poetic on the significance of BOC, and the talents of guitarist Buck Dharma, Jimmy is truly in his element.  Still bitter that his father crushed his musical dreams, his success is largely dependent on the talent of others.Lois Smith (Twister,Five Easy Pieces) is spot on as Jimmy's mom, who still has the ability to transform the forty year-old, into a little boy.  Many could play a loudmouth prick, but Bobby Cannavale does it with an authentic sense of New York style.  The talented and versatile Jill Hennessey (Law & Order,Crossing Jordan), is always a pleasure to watch.  Her musical talents bring great realism to Nikki, who is struggling with her own unrealized dreams.  Hennessy performs part of \"Ghost In My Head\", the title track from her 2009 album.While not completely original, Roadie largely works because it is thoughtfully written, and features some extremely talented actors.  Providing ample opportunities for reflection, this is a particularly interesting watch for those who have faced a midlife crisis, and is punctuated by a selection of music, which adds firmly to the film's impact.  Among the featured songs are Robin Trower's \"About To Begin\" and \"Long Misty Days\", Jethro Tull's haunting \"My God\", Blue Oyster Cult's \"Cites on Flame\", and perhaps most apropos, as it deals with the life of a roadie, \"The Load Out\", which is unfortunately not the original version performed by Jackson Browne."
B006H06CFO Every now and then a gem that i've never heard of sneaks up on me.Once in a while when you read the plot on the cover of the dvd at the rental store it doesn't let you down.\"Answers To Nothing\" fit that bill for me.What a little gem this movie is!It starts with a little girl getting kidnapped from her bedroom in the night by a deviant but in between the manhunt for the criminal and her is a bunch od stories mixed into thru the movie.A woman who takes care of her invalid brother and desperately tries to keep custody of him,even enters both of them in the l.a marathon,very heartwarming story.A couple trying to conceive by artificial ensemination,a man obsessed with the child kidnapping case,etc.Rent it...you won't be disapointed!!! 5 stars easily !!!"
B006I0GSZM This is a mediocre rendition of a Stephen King novel of the same name.It dragged a great deal and was more unpleasant than scary.A shame as the book was great"
B006I0GSZM I also watched Bag of Bones on DVD which is based on a novel by Stephen King. I bought the book years ago on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Nobles. I read it quickly and loved it. When the miniseries aired back in December, I had other things going on and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Bag of Bones is good, but several things have been changed and left out from the book. I love ghost stories, so I naturally love it despite of it's flaws."
B006I0GSZM The sound was excellent.  The costumes, brilliant. Acting was right on for King 's book. It is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment."
B006I0GSZM Out of Stephen King's countless books, \"Bag of Bones\" is probably the easiest to adapt -- it's a straightforward ghost story about revenge, murder and writer's block.So of course it was eventually adapted into a TV miniseries of the same name, with Pierce Brosnan playing a bestselling author (take a shot) staying in a small Maine town (take a shot) with some ugly skeletons in its closet. The first half is a tedious affair, mostly setting up various clues for Brosnan -- but the second half is a genuinely disturbing, heartrending tale.After his pregnant wife Jo (Annabeth Gish) is killed by a runaway bus, writer Mike Noonan (Brosnan) is understandably devastated. He also finds himself unable to write, so he ends up heading off to the Maine lake-house that Jo had been fixing up for several months. He also is grappling with suspicions that Jo was unfaithful to him, since he was told that they couldn't have children.But during his stay, he begins to see strange ghostly events -- fridge magnets spell out messages, strong winds blow, and the music of 1930s blues singer Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) plays. Soon Mike figures out that there are two ghosts: one is Jo, and the other is far more malevolent.He also inadvertently becomes involved in a custody battle between wealthy, cruel Max Devore (William Schallert) and his beautiful daughter-in-law Mattie (Melissa George) over Mattie's young daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael). But as Mike tries to figure out why Devore wants his granddaughter, he learns of a string of brutal murders stretching back through the years -- and the terrible crimes that started it all.The first episode of \"Bag of Bones\" moves at a very slow pace, primarily devoted to setting up the clues and the whole custody battle. In fact, a lot of it is about Mike drifting around, struggling to write and having strange visions that are (of course) prophetic -- and if it weren't for the occasional ghostly visitations, you might forget that this is a Stephen King story.One advantage of the slow episode is that it gives Brosnan plenty of time to develop Mike. Yes, he's another bestselling writer character with a personal tragedy, but it feels so much more REAL with Brosnan. He really makes you feel the life-destroying anguish of losing your spouse (possibly drawing from experience), and the passionate paternal feelings that Kyra stokes in him.But the second episode lashes together the horror, clues and custody battle into one dark, bloody package -- and suddenly the horror is flowing pretty quickly. Ironically, the most horrifying part is the human capacity for brutality (a graphic rape-murder scene, the attempts to kill children), but there is still plenty of ropy-faced zombies, curses and the occasional crazy old crone throwing rocks or scissors.One major problem, however, is Max Devore and his crazy sidekick Rogette. These characters are so utterly, revoltingly, sadistically evil that they become cartoons rather than antagonists -- it wouldn't surprise me if they tortured puppies for fun. And it's never really explained why various men want to kill a kid who isn't theirs. Do they think it will lift the curse? I have no idea.It takes its sweet time to drag itself to the horror content, but if you can hang on through the slow, character-building first episode, \"Bag of Bones\" is a dark and heartfelt ghost story."
B006I0GSZM First, it should be mentioned that I am a Stephen King fan. As far as I know, I've read all of his books, and \"Bag of Bones\" was one of my favorites. I loved everything about it- the summer Maine setting, the characters, and the \"traditional\" ghost story setup. It would be unreasonable to expect every detail of the novel to be crammed into a two episode TV mini-series. Instead, the producers did a great job of cutting where they had to, making small changes where necessary, but mostly retaining the story and the FEEL of King's \"Bag of Bones\". Be warned that it can (and will) get cheesy at times, but that's part of the charm.I watched this on rainy October evening, with a warm Labrador curled on my lap, a mug of hot chocolate near at hand. This was a great experience- nothing too mind blowing or horrific (I'm not a huge fan of horror movies); just a good, comfortable ghost story. It's mostly a harmless affair, with moderate amounts of tension (undoubtedly reduced since I had already read the novel) and no excess gore. Instead, the story revolves around psychological fear and exploration, with a solid performance turned in by Pierce Brosnan (King fans are lucky to have him on board for this TV adaptation). If you're fan of King's work, or ghost stories in general, grab a mug of hot chocolate on a cool fall evening, tune in, and enjoy."
B006I0GSZM Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series."
B006I0GSZM I have always loved the imagination of Stephen King and this series on A&E; called the \"Bag of Bones\" relates to what I had been through with the loss of the only man I have ever loved.  The thinking they are there in a room with you or they have sent you a sign telling you how to handle their passing.  Pierce Bronson is perfect in the role and the rest of cast was chosen well.  That is one thing I like about Stephen King he does not let Hollywood or Television change his stories they are just like the books he writes.  Wonderful Series and I intend to buy it to see them all on my laptop to know how it ends is what makes King a great writer, as you never know how he will end his stories.  Great work this series is by a wonderful writer of so much that a world enjoys the challenge of how the story proceeds and ends.  Thank you Amazon for giving this to your customers to enjoy....Link to Bag of Bones Series -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006I0GSZM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
B006I0GSZM The story was a bit contrived but the acting excellent.  Always a surprise ending with Stephen King who leaves you hanging until the last."
B006I0GSZM Pierce Bronson plays Michael Noonan, a New England author, in a continuing of Stephen King's write about things you are series. When is wife, who he truly loved, dies, he is drawn to their lake home. Noonan has nightmares about his wife in the final scene of \"Quarantine\". At the lake home he inadvertently gets involved in a local drama and discovers some small town secrets that frankly would make a good novel, which BTW he has to write.I enjoyed the simple ghostly images and hauntings. Noonan takes the paranormal in stride as he tries to uncover more about the illness known as Dark Score Crazy which causes people to drown their daughters. What is unfortunate is any Stephen King fan can watch the film and see where the master has done this before. For instance when we see the computer screen with the same line written over and over, one can not help think about \"The Shining.\" The question begs: Does King want us to think about \"The Shining\" and give us a clue that Noonan is crazy or is it a deliberate misdirection? Or maybe King is starting to recycle old trunk novels as does the writer in the story. Outside of Noonan, the characters were poorly developed, especially considering the length of the film.While I enjoyed the film, I have come to expect more from Stephen King.Made for TV. Includes a rape scene."
B006I0GSZM That's about it.  He is engaging, but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline, violence, and other characters.  Too bad.  I am sure the book was better; I read it some time ago, since I always read King's work."
B006I0GSZM Adapting a Stephen King novel to the screen has proved to be a dicey proposition for writers/directors in the past.  Either the film is a huge hit (like \"Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Green Mile\"), or it turns into a B-movie that doesn't nearly live up to the billing.  In the case of \"Bag of Bones\", director Mick Garris does a remarkable job of translating the page to the screen.For a basic plot summary, \"Bag of Bones\" sees writer Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) struggling with severe writers block after the death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish).  To try and break out of his funk, Mike heads to his summer retreat home on Dark Score lake, where Jo had frequented often.  While there, Mike meets Mattie Devore (Melissa George) and her daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael), who draw him into a haunting (literally!) mystery surrounding town baron Max Devore (William Schallert) & the unexplained death of 1930s jazz songstress Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose).What makes \"Bag of Bones\" really work is the fact that it doesn't stray too much from the original King subject matter.  It had been awhile since I read the novel, so I can't nit-pick all that much, but the film seemed to do a good job of sticking to the script, so to speak, and not deviate from King's wonderfully compelling (and spooky) tale.The acting, for the most part, is also quite fine.  Brosnan is very capable as the lead, while only a couple of the key auxiliary roles are sub-par.  Special credit needs to be given to little Ms. Carmichael, who really gives the show its emotional kick throughout.About the only thing this film doesn't translate well from the book are the \"villain\" characters (you'll know who they are after you watch).  In the book, I seem to remember much more character development about them, which was excised from this adaptation likely due to time.  It shows a bit in the end, when t
B006LG7IJ8 What I love about this show is there isn't one second that isn't outright silliness.There is so much comedic creativity here. The two lead characters even do gender reversals with the woman dressed as a man with his girlfriend in her red wig played by the man. And they do it so well including the voices, that it's easy to forget who is whom and just laugh.The people are all whacky, the situations are all outlandish, and the entire city apparently is off kilter. I can't wait to go there after watching this. While this is extreme craziness I do feel that there is a lot of truth here about how Portland actually is after knowing some charming delightful people from there. I was wondering if it was just this particular group of friends that seemed funnier than people I know on the east coast or what but now I'm thinking it's a funny place in general.This show keeps the spacey hipster goofiness coming at you non stop. It seems like the initial burst of steam the first season displayed has quieted down several notches.It's still funny but not hilareous like it was. And what makes it so special is it seems to frequently feature situations we are all familiar with. Waiting in line for hours at a popular restaurant for a table, overeager parents of a preschooler trying desperately to get their boy into the right preschool, the child hearing his parents making funny sounds in the bedroom, are some of the episodes.This show is more creative than most things out there and is a breath of fresh air. Not many shows make me smile and laugh any more but this one lightens my mood better than any."
B006LG7IJ8 Penny Marshall guest starred in this show. The small part was perfect for her. Portlandia is not for everyone, the humor is a acquired taste but I enjoy the quirkiness of the characters."
B006LG7IJ8 The humor is clever but not funny for me personally. I get it but a big &#34;so what&#34; in my way of being. I prefer comedy which has me laughing out loud some of the time and holds my interest."
B006LG7IJ8 I used to live in Portland, kind of get the self-conscious posturing of Portland denizens; kind of phony, but at heart sincere and well-intentioned. Carrie and Fred have nailed the lifestyle-I remember waiting in line for an hour for famous pancakes that supposed to be organic, natural and healthy, but were as dense as corrugated iron. Enjoy the easy-going spoofing and seeing the sites of Portland-it really is a beautiful place."
B006LG7IJ8 I love these crazy actors! they'll do anything for a laugh, the impersonations of the west coast portlandereeer's is extremely funny!"
B006LG7IJ8 In their continued, playful lambasting of hipsters, progressives, and weirdos of Portland (not to mention their smaller sister of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, ahem), Carrie and Fred do a marvelous job of bringing fresh fun to sketch comedy. Not only can they pickle eggs, cucumbers, and assorted inedible objects, they can also give just about any concept their funky \"pickling\" treatment.The chemistry between these two is downright magical, and the variations in the identities they assume is stunning. You always know that it's Fred and Carrie (obviously), but the transformation in their delivery and personality as they change roles is fascinating to watch, along with the mostly subtle visual changes (like Fred's awesome selection of wigs).Favorite moments from Season Two include Andy Samberg starring as a mixologist in one episode, Fred and Carrie attempting to take over the role of Portland law enforcement, and the induction of Kevin into the band \"Cat Nap\". Looking forward to Season Three!"
B006LG7IJ8 By this season they were like 50's jazz at Birdland.  If one player ever became predictable, others would counter or shift it.  Every episode is a mini Christopher Guest movie...which means exaggerated silly and absurd behavior from characters who often lack self awareness.  The \"Catnapped\" episode may even be funnier than the Sarah Silverman Program's \"Tab\" episode or Eastbound and Down's \"Cookout\" episode."
B006LG7IJ8 Porlandia and its inhabitants will be familiar to anyone who practices green ethics, shops at the coop and is generally left of center (and proud of it!).  Hipsters, old hippies, overly involved parents and trendiness are all given a wonderful satirical going over in this show.  My personal favorite...\"Gotta get the Gear\"..... since I definitely buy too much junk when I get into a hobby.  You do not have to live in Portland to enjoy this...Eugene, Davis, Eureka or any of the other small cities that are inhabited by us greensters will do.  I laugh at each episode and recognize myself in the sends ups.  Good fun.  Well I am off to REI and Trader Joe's cause I gotta get the gear."
B006LWHBDA I liked this season better than the others do far. Only a few into it but the players are comical"
B006LWHBDA I buy auction units in Southern California in Dotson territory.  These guys are really nice and make the auctions fun.  My issue is the California show has run the price of the units sky high.  My wife and I will watch the show and say what we would pay for the auctions in question.  We always seem to be to low for California but right on for Texas.  The characters in this show are good and the merchandise that is won is pretty interesting.  I would like to go to Texas to go to one of these auctions just based on this show.  It is fun to watch and it is a good time.  Watch it, you wont be disappointed."
B006LWHBDA I love watching this show and seeing what treasures are found. I'm addicted and will watch to the very end."
B006LYWJR6 A-W-E-S-O-M-E! If you're ever having an OFF day.  This is your ticket to BLISS.  Five star and for good reason.  It helps you learn, laugh and want to dance while gleefully saying I'm #1. I'M #1. Because you really are."
B006LZSF8M No hard sell on going vegan. I was open to going vegan but the film affirmed my view that vegans are so disgusted with factory farming that  they opt out all together. The film on cruely and animal abuse in factory farming, which they showed to their three New Yorkers  , willing to give it a try,  seemed to have the biggest effect.They were traumatised . As most americans would be if they chose not to turn a blind eye or were exposed to the sickening cruelty as suppressed by corporate interests.However it encouraged me to investigate if cage free eggs were more humane or Perdue chickens and their not. So the film 's a reminder to those of us trying to do the right thing and be more vigilant in sourcing animal food/ products farmed humanely.I think a film on changing diet to be more vetarian with a little/less meat and where to find it and being sure to verify pervasive fraudulant claims ( that are somehow still legal) is more useful.  Whatever- this over-comsumption of meat and dairy within the last century  is not sustainable enviromentally or in health costs; we need more films to make the transition than turn vegan. I did not feel it was very representative that 2 out of 3 of the film's guinia-pigs were  persuaded to turn vegan in the end."
B006LZSF8M First up, I've been a vegan for nearly a year and I can attest to the transformational effects it has on your health, fitness, attitude and lifestyle. I've been a single-person marketing campaign for films such as Forks Over Knives and Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, both of which illustrate effectively the positive effects of a plant-based diet (beer is plant based, woo-hoo). Personally, I think the biggest negative of veganism is the stereotyped baggage that follows which I try to fight all the time - vegetable eaters aren't all smoking weed in their drum circles trying to fight the man.While I support any effort to show people how the Western diet is bad for your health, this film comes across as more of a PETA commercial than an attempt to follow 3 people willfully changing their lifestyle. I'm completely against the way that mass farm treats animals but spreading the vegan word must surely come from illustrating the gains that individuals make rather than having a political agenda about animal treatment. That said, what is shown in the film in the animal processing facilities is disturbing and the public should be aware - but let's make that a focus of a different film.For me, this film lacked the journey promised in the subtitle about following 3 New Yorkers becoming vegan which could have been funny, personal, touching and dramatic. As a contrast, I think Forks Over Knives is a substantially more approachable film for non-vegans and doesn't press the animal cruelty buttons to guilt people into quitting hamburgers."
B006LZSF8M This film's goal is to educate you as to the health benefits of a vegan, or at least vegetarian lifestyle, but even more, it is dedicated to educating people as to the horrible atrocities committed to fill the shelves in the meat section of your local grocer. It basically takes three people from different lifestyles and challenges them to embrace a vegan lifestyle for six weeks. During those six weeks, as they are learning how they can eat properly without meat or dairy products, they are also exposed to the dark underbelly of animal butchery and production. The film is very graphic in this respect, showing the inside of chicken, beef, and pork production plants and farms. One scene shows the castration of a cow. Very disturbing. The film also teaches about how, just because a label says free range, organic, and cruelty free, it doesnt really actually meet those standards. For example, when we see 'free range', i think we all have a picture of an animal traipsing about a meadow until it's slaughter time (which is gruesome enough). In reality, they are still kept in small pens and squalid conditions, but are simply not confined 12 chickens to a single tiny cage. They show how chicken beaks are melted off to keep them from fighting in the cages. They show a lot. In fact, if you were to watch this film, i think you might view the consumption of meat and dairy quite differently, from both an appeal standpoint, and also from an ethical one.There is some sloppy editing in this film, including at least one glaringly obvious misspelling, but t
B006LZSF8M So enlightening about the sources of our food and what is actually nutritious.  Of course, I worked for a meat packer and was steered away from the slaughter floor several decades ago, but somehow it just seemed necessary.  Older is wiser and a revisit to the scene makes me question what I eat though years ago I reduced serving sizes and use some vegetable protein in cooking I was still eating fish, eggs, milk products etc.  Well produced to direct you to thinking about what you are putting in your body at who's expense.  Watch it with your kids.  Definitely more important than gun control and can save your life."
B006NU7C48 I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff"
B006NU7C48 I love this show. So funny! My favorite British comedians. The writers are amazing and this is one of my favorite series"
B006NU7C48 Eddy & Pats are my idea of the perfect pair. They remind me that no matter how corrupt and decadent you are, you can still be hilarious"
B006NU7C48 Lotsa fun.  Reminds me of my own selfish flippy-dippy hippie youth.  So refreshing to see ladies who know how to have a good time and are not constantly yammering on about their tedious tots and the tubby hubby.  Martha Stewart would be pitched into the Thames without ceremony.  No white sale at Penney's here.  Highly recommended."
B006O2WRHM My two year old loves gabba. Loves gabba. We watch an episode every single day. The songs get stuck in my head but they are catchy. As an adult I like the guest stars and the bands they have on the show. I also like how the lessons teach proper social behavior and norms, like sharing and not biting people."
B006O2WRHM My two year old freezes in place when we put yo gaba gaba on. Then he mimics DJ Lance's dance moves. Great show!"
B006O3Z39U Ghost Hunters started very modestly but has become something of a showhorse. The exit of the humble Grant Wilson was a foreboding of a slicker production lead by Grant's less humble buddy, Jason Hawes. the strange hirings and firings of last season break open with a new season of celebrity guest stars and questionable evidence. Ghost hunters must be credited, though with the current interest and methods of paranormal investigation copied by so many others."
B006O3Z39U This is a series my wife and I find irresistible.  We have never been disappointed.  If someone would reply letting me know why the recent seasons aren't available with Roku (or other devices), I would greatly appreciate it!"
B006O3Z39U Will always enjoy GH. Their travels take them places that I would never have considered and the investigation finds along the way make it an enjoyable program."
B006O3Z39U I love this show. It is absolutely my favorite show on tv. BUT, WHERE IS IT!!!!!!! I love the show. I love the people, their interaction with each other and the spirits. I absolutely believe this is a credible show and that what they are doing is real. I love the technology that they use and their professionalism and competence. And I think this next season is going to be one of the best, but I can't find it. I was in the middle of purchasing whole seasons and poof gone. Help me tell syfy that people are cutting the cable cord and need Amazon to have access to this. I'm sure they would make more money by people buying seasons than paying cable. This is a great show you learn allot and get real thrills unlike with sparkly vampires or gruesome not got to watch movies!!!"
B006O3Z39U Steve and Tango still my favorites. They make ghost hunting fun."
B006O3Z39U I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked."
B006O3Z39U Another great list of investigations from the ghost hunter team, this time they go to more great places, and catch great evidence! I can't wait for part 2 to come out, i'll be glued to that dvd as well!"
B006O3Z39U I'm a Ghost Hunters junkie but do not have cable.  Getting this by instant video on Amazon is the best legal, way to keep my K2 meter flashing."
B006O3Z39U Not too bad an episode, wished they had gone over all the EVP's with the client they found. Still strange without Grant.. and not sure about Jason's very fast spoken commentary."
B006OU14BO Where I live now there's very little going on, so this is great and fills a need to see people going through the grinds and joys of life together, even though these are some tough streetwise cookies. I guess that's what makes it fun."
B006RECSBC The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite t
B006RECSBC A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one-time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.The only other film I've seen from writer/director Ti West was \"The House of the Devil\" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the sto
B006RECSBC My first relevant question would  be - how old was the person who wrote this?My guess would be somewhere around 12.Good ghost films are rare to be sure, and some make a reasonable effort.This one does not."
B006RECSBC A historic inn is closing after many years, closing not only a connection to the past but also a connection to what happened in the basement. There is a legend about a death and about a body, and it leads to stories told by patrons and staff alike. The two people on-shift have taken note of it too, one going as far as to make a website of his encounter and the other just wanting to look around. what begins as fun at closing time starts to slide into contact, and contact leads to more as the inn slides toward being forgotten.I'll be honest, I had high hopes for this film and actually picked it up after seeing some solid reviews.  for some reason, slow building horror movies seem to make a dent with people who lean toward more mainstream films, and that is alright. If that includes your forays into horror and suspense, this might even be something for you. I liked parts of it, and might have liked it more if something would have happened to keep me going. You had a lot of moments that went up in tempo, getting the music playing and the thrills kicking, and you had things that manifested here and there that seemed to say escalation was in order. In fact, it kept on doing that while trying to stay tense but it all felt hollow after a while, like there should have been a few less false alarms and more contact.Basically, I felt like you had an interesting start, some spooky \"did you hear that\" moments, a nice payout toward the end with minimal effects and a \"its there\" without the audience seeing it approach to haunting, and an decently interesting end you could see coming. The issue I had was the how long a lot of this took and how redundant revisiting a psychic or watching someone try to find what is making that sound can become. Removing the end because it should always have some payout, a few EVP moments done by not one but two people, a few doors closing and many false alarms, and a strange old man do not making a haunting. It did have some eerie moments and it had all the elements, but just felt like it felt incomplete.to me, the Innkeepers felt like a promise being made and never delivered. That's why I'm going 3/5, saying it was ok, but it should have been better."
B006RECSBC This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake.  It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying."
B006RXPUQ8 I'm Not Jesus Mommy (Vaughn Juares, 2010)For the first third or so of its length, save some subpar acting, I'm Not Jesus Mommy is an intriguing little low-budget movie that, on many levels, makes perfect sense. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath in her first feature), an obstetrician, is haunted by her own inability to conceive. When maverick researcher Roger Gibson (Living Arrangements' Charles Hubbell) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning, she resists at first, but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives. The obvious question becomes: how far will a woman go to have a baby?Then we skip forward seven years, and everything goes to hell. Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age. The streets are dangerous, there is little food to go around, and Roger, Roger's sister, Kimberly, and Kimberly's son David are holed up in a small apartment, only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food. The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising, no? And perhaps in the right hands, the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be. But, and isn't there always a &#8220;but&#8221; after a statement like that?, it...isn't. I'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully, so I'll go with &#8220;I'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity.&#8221;  One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved, so the &#8220;some subpar acting&#8221; of the first third, which you can gloss over with everything else going on, takes center stage.  Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich&eacute;&#8212;in fact, runs headlong into it as often as possible&#8212;and you've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through.  Don't hit play on this one unless you have prepared yourself for an overdose of cheese. *"
B006RZZDU4 4/5 for great story.Pros:1. Story is excellent.2. Decent visuals for a motion comic.3. It's the most epic Iron Man moment.Cons:1.  Story could be told in a more direct way.2.  Motion comics typically do not look very smooth and remind me of animations you might see on Newgrounds.3.  Voice acting could be a lot better, though it isn't bad per se."
B006RZZDU4 Very fresh update telling of Iron Man series, the only problem I have with it is that it's a motion comic which I have yet to get used to. Would definitely recommend it if you like the Iron Man series."
B006S0007E I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons. Buy the movies instead. They're more entertaining."
B006S0007E This is a stop motion comic book and I enjoyed it very much.  Years ago marvel came out with comics books on CD for the computer which I brought and they was very good but I think the public was not ready for the CDs and they did not sell.  I still have these disc but they plays on a very old cumputer system like window 98 and I canot play them anymore but I enjoyed them very much and I am glad they came out with the stop motion comics.  This is a good buy."
B006S0007E Considering the current level of animation this is almost primitive, though well-drafted. Animation is sparse and motion is often portrayed by moving the static image in the frame which I found to be like watching shadow puppets. It's well-written and probably too mature and cerebral for children. Not really a waste of time but not action entertainment or even decent anime."
B006SV4QFK This show has inspired me to clean up my stuff.  Vance thinks his IQ is 200, yet he's not smart enough to figure out how to clean his house.  He's the kind of person teaching at your child's university."
B006SV4QFK This show shows you just how things can get out of control.  I feel for these people who live alone and have just given up on life, it's very sad.  Some of them seem like really nice people and this shouldn't be happening to them.  If you want a dose of reality, this is a show to watch.  Sometimes when I think times are tough, this show proves it could be a lot worse.  The 1-800-GOT-JUNK guys seem really nice and considerate of people's possessions, given the situation.  Dorothy is great, Matt is wonderful and I absolutely love Dr. Zasio!  They are all wonderful people who try to help those less fortunate.  A true reality show!!!"
B006SV4QFK mental illness is a fascinating thing and how people get attached to objects because they've been let down by friends or family is really fascinating. I don't, however, feel sorry for them. they are fully aware of what they are doing"
B006SV4QFK After watching these people I feel like I need to take a shower. Where do they find these hoarders they make it seem like there is one in every neighborhood. The show is good but after a couple of episodes it is all the same someone with OCD who has too much stuff and can't part with it. I often wonder if it is even real. One season would have been enough."
B006SV4QFK The minds of some people are very interesting.  It is sad but the reality exists and shedding light on it helps to bring it out if the shadows and into the light where it can be addressed. I thinks it is a fascinating show."
B006SV4QFK I'm not at all sure there is anything better than an exclusive tour of other people's filth. THAT is entertainment!"
B006SV4QFK I love watching this show, because it gives me the feeling of having just cleaned my house from top to bottom without actually having to do anything."
B006SV5Z0U A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.The above was my review for Season 10. All of these episodes present variations of the 'typical' profile of substance abusers. This is not to negate an individuals circumstances but to emphasize their personalities. There is an accurate portrayal of dysfunction within the family unit and other relationships. The multiple substances of choice offer a wide spectrum and an accurate description of the medical/mental consequences.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.' If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min production by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate."
B006SV5Z0U Nothing special, the formula seems to work for the show but I am finding it starting to drag on. Same ol, same ol."
B006SV5Z0U Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face.  Richard dealt with his dear sister's death and being molested for years without others knowing.  He's had it tough, but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure, except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell.  Richard did some activist/non-profit work; I'm guessing he had anti-drug resources that he didn't bother to access.  Yes, his brother is/was homophobic, but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around.  He is sucking his mother dry of money.  The work never mentions HIV/AIDS, but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any \"Intervention\" episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones.  Richard wasn't even brave enough to stay.  You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs.  I highly doubt that.  He just seemed very nasty and abusive.  I can't imagine him staying sober.  He really needs to do nicer things so he can get some good Karma.  Otherwise, he's in BIG, BIG trouble!"
B006TA764S I do remember commenting at its end that it was a decent watch.  Obviously, once is enough. So enough said."

B0016KZZG2 After months of dry carpet and adventures in the car, I am finally able to rate this product.  It fits our Nestl&eacute; waters and other bottles along the way.  My rough and tumble boy has only stepped on it once to squirt the water, and in all other cases it has not leaked and gave me peace of mind not using the water fountain. No more water logged shirts and scrambles for a clean cup while in public.  I really like this product.  Please note your child will make teeth marks on the nozzle.  My only complaint is that there are 2 nozzles but only one top (as the picture shows).  Why not provide a top for each nozzle?  We make it work though, and it was still worth it.
B0016KZZG2 We purchased this spout for our 2 year old and are wishing we would have purchased it earlier.Pros:- Non leak spout- 2 year old can use it easilyCons:- larger than expected, but doesn't harm its effectiveness.
B0016KZZG2 Works as described!  And it does create a kind of vacuum so the bottle will collapse as you drink, but still-- just pop the cap off and back on again and that solves that problem.
B0016M10C8 These are awful. They do not stay put. They are too small to cover vinyl completely. Should have some sort of slidproofing on back.
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0016NHN82 We used this tub for both our boys. I really liked how cushioned it was, and it was quite durable. The first one lasted about a year, and then we purchased another because we liked it so much. It wasn't the easiest to blow up, however.
B0016NP0ZA The Boon Bug Pod is a complete scam. I ordered the Boon Bug because I thought it was so cute, but when I finally got it, the only way to attach it to my tub was to drill into the wall. So I had to make another purchase of the suction cup bracket so make it work. What a rip off.
B0016NP0ZA I've used this on two different walls now. A fiberglass tub wall and a porcelain subway tile wall. It's worked great both times by following the instructions. I think one of the mistakes that people make is wetting the suction cups. I've done that too and it slides. The instructions say to use alcohol on the wall to make sure it is bone dry. It also says the suction cups need to be dry. When all surfaces are dry and flat it seems to work very well.
B0016NP0ZA I bought this at the same time as the lady bug toy holder because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.  It would be nice if this were included in the main product, but at least it is offered as an option and I think worth the extra few bucks.
B0016NP0ZA I had the taped bracket and it fell so decided to give this one a try. It has fallen once but that may be my fault (too much weight). It is great because even if it does fall you can just put it back up without having to purchase replacement tabs like the other one. I also like because we plan to move soon and I don't have to worry about getting this out of the bathroom. Would definitely recommend.
B001708AS6 I purchased this valance for our nursery and they look perfect!  I didn't want anything that was too pink.  This valance is light and airy .
B0017AE3BO The handle is nice to have and makes it easier to use. The bristles are just like any other standrd shampoo brush. Have never used the soap dispensing function, but I am sure it works fine.
B0017AE3BO What a waste of money. I am so bummed that I threw away the box & can no longer return it even though I only used it once. Seems great in theory but does not work at all! Soap did not dispense and I swear after using the brush it actually GAVE my baby flakes on her scalp! This is totally going in the trash
B0017LCZEU I made two hand print ornaments from this kit.  The dough was easy to roll, and I really liked the final product.  The ornament was a bit boring, so I painted it with glitter and glazed it for shine.
B0017LCZEU follow the directions closely and you  shouldn't have any issues.Mine turned out very lovely and i couldn't be happier. i did a bunch of them for christmas gifts too ( you can only make 2 from each box tho, i'm saying i bought more to use as christmas gifts)don't put them near direct heat or direct cold and they will last in better condition.
B0017LCZEU Skip the round mold and the straw that are included with this kit as they leave rough edges. Best to roll 1/3 - 1/2 of the clay into a ball in your hands with a sprinkle of water then flatten it out, ideally onto something non-stick, by hand or with a smooth bottomed plate that's also been spritzed with water. Immediately press baby's hand or foot into the clay in a gentle but firm rolling motion from heel to toe or palm to fingertips then quickly touch up any edge cracking with moistened finger tips.My disks took about a week to fully cure during dry mid-Winter. Even then they should be very carefully removed from whatever surface they're drying on and the back may still not be entirely smooth. The included ribbon is &#34;meh&#34; in quality and color and you'll need a thin acrylic paint from a craft or art store anyway if you don't want to keep the matte white clay finish. To add ribbon holes I used a low volt power drill with progressively larger drill bits until I got the diameter I wanted.
B0017LCZEU Since I was having my first child, I wanted to do everything. I got these around Christmas and tried them. the first time was a disaster. I followed the directions but the clay kept getting stuck to the cutter. finally I used my head and sprayed pam on the round cutter before cutting into the clay. best idea ever! if you get this, remember what I said. itll come in handy.
B0017LCZEU This is one of the best ways to preserve your child's hand or footprint.  Easy to mold and shape, dries nicely.  SOOOOOO much better than dealing with plaster!!!!  This material is awesome!
B0017LCZEU It went together easy and even held up to multiple kneading.  My son tended to grab it once we made the impression and so we had to redo it multiple times.  Eventually had to hold him upside down so the his catch reflex triggered and he held his hands out. LOL. But we got it and then it was easy to use the tools to cut it and the hole for the ribbon out and the ribbons were great. We were actually able to make two with one kit.
B0017LCZEU I actually spread the clay out to make 3 ornaments for Christmas. It was easy. It took about 3 days for the clay to dry in a moist climate.
B0017LCZEU This \"kit\" consists of:-A sealed package of molding material-A \"hole punch.\"  It is actually part of a drinking straw.  Literally.  It is the bottom few inches of a flimsy, striped plastic drinking straw.-A \"rolling pin.\"  This is a piece of dowel, about 1/2\" in diameter.-A wooden cookie-cutter.  Adequate for the job but leave sloppy edges.-Three lengths of ribbon: 1 blue, 1 pink, and 1 cream/yellowish in colorThe material is easy to work with and is a good consistency.  I was able to make 2 ornaments with a bit left over.  (I would not have had enough material to make 3.)  So, this kit will definitely provide what you need to make 2 plaques as advertised.  But given what it includes, it's difficult to see what justifies the price.  It's a chunk of synthetic clay plus a few pennies' worth of add-ons.Okay, a couple of tips for use of this product:1.  If you have a round biscuit cutter or cookie-cutter of an appropriate size, definitely use that instead of the cutter they provide - you'll get much cleaner edges!2.  The packaging said that the ornaments would dry in 1-2 days.  I did not find this to be true.  It took nearly a week before mine were fully hardened and dry.  I live in a desert climate, so I do not think humidity was the issue.  So, if you are planning to make these as a gift, DO NOT wait until the last minute -- give yourself plenty of lead time for them to dry!!
B0017LCZEU I though this clay came with the stand; the picture is misleading. It takes a few tries before you get it right, but works well!
B0017LCZEU This kit is very user friendly.  Easy to use.  However, the clay is too hard.  I'm debating whether to purchase another one because I think I need to apply more pressure when doing the hand prints to get deeper better prints.  However, I pushed down on the sleeping baby's hand pretty hard.  The cutter was bad as all the other reviews say, I used a box cutter to cut away the excess left from the circular cutter provided in the kit.  Forget about using the &#34;rolling pin&#34; they provide unless you want weird dents in your clay and uneven clay..I used my own rolling pin.  Given the price and the fact that 2 of the items included in the kit I had to use my own household item or improvise I give it 3 stars majority going towards ease of use.  Note: apply pressure when doing hand prints! Don't hurt your little one though!!
B0017LCZEU You could probably make your own salt dough and save some money instead of buying this product. I was not impressed.
