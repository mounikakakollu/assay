B0016KV73W Pros-Travels easy (it fits in my diaper bag) & it has a travel bagSecures great on the pottyYou can do it as a free standing for out & about emergencies ( they have an insert you can buy)It gives my toddler confidence that he's not going to fall inConsIf you use it as a stand alone the legs have to be locked in & it was a little hard for me to snap into placeI've bought 2 - one for home & one for travel. He loves it, this was the only thing that was worth a darn besides the primo potty
B0016KV73W My son is in the 97th percentile and about 2 1/2.  This thing was so tiny it was a joke.  I could see how it might be great if it was appropriately sized for your child, but it is definitely not the answer if you have a bigger than average kiddo.
B0016KV73W I bought this potty to keep in the car for when we are out and about. In the &#34;potty&#34; position (legs down) it isn't sturdy at all because the legs don't lock in that position. Twice it has collapse under the my baby which has led to epic meltdowns. So in reality it's just a travel toilet reducer. Not very 2-in-1.
B0016KV73W A great little travel potty for early trainers, but the instructions are not complete.Pros:Small size is perfect for babies and young toddlers.Can be used as either a stand-alone potty or on top of a toilet, giving you options.Folds up very compact.You can use standard plastic grocery bags, just put a paper towel or cloth diaper inside.Cons:The legs are wobbly in the stand-alone potty position, making me a little nervous if my baby was too wiggly. EDIT: I figured out why the legs felt wobbly. You need to push them UP towards the seat to fully lock them. The enclosed instructions do not say this, but it's very important!!!The bags that are designed for the potty stink of perfume.
B0016KV73W My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.
B0016KV73W We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.
B0016KV73W let me just say this potty seat is amazing! It's sturdy, little enough to put almost anywhere, folds down great. I bought some extra liners, but in my opinion save your money & buy the reusable liner that goes with this seat. Also wonderful quality, and come on, how hard is it to dump out & wipe with a wet wipe.
B0016KV73W This is the best baby product ever invented!  It's cheap, sturdy & fits in my kid's skip hop bag.  We have had potty training success because of this gem!  She's going on her 3rd week of PT & this weekend we took her to Disney on Ice & a weekend trip to the beach.  The crowds in public restrooms I think intimidate her but I just put this potty on the back seat of the car in the parking lot & wha la! When the crowds are smaller I use the handicap stall & set this potty up on the side & we take a potty break together.  On the beach I set up her potty in a play tent & she had her own little outhouse.  She loves her new potty & so do I!  We no longer have to fear accidents or her holding it too long till she feels comfortable.  The liners are super absorbant so you don't have a messy, leaking bag to deal with.  I won't leave home without it.  Thank you inventers of the potette travel potty.  THANK YOU!
B0016KV73W Great on-the-go potty because the sides fold in and it's easy to stash in a bag. Love that it's both a stand-alone potty and a toilet topper.  if your toilet is oblong shaped like ours, this potty seat will seem too small.  We always have to remind our son to point it down and to close his legs before he starts to pee.  Otherwise, it will almost always splash out of the gap between the potty seat and the toilet seat or over the potty seat - something we do not have a problem with on our Baby Bjorn toilet trainer.
B0016KV73W This little portable potty chair has been a life safer as we have traveled around with our almost 3 year old
B0016KV73W This travel potty is on my \"baby must-have\" list.  We've used it while traveling on both long trips and short and also while camping.  It's great to use as a booster potty on those icky campground port-a-potties.  We keep it in the car just in case!
B0016KV73W This is one of my top five favorite baby/toddler items to ever purchase.  When my daughter needs to go it isn't an issue finding a clean restroom.  I highly recommend to anyone who is potty training and beyond.
B0016KV73W I really couldn't even tell you how many times this little potty has saved my daughter's outfits, carseat, my van, and my sanity. I don't use it in public restrooms as we have something else we use for those instead. I keep it set up in my van with a bag already lining it (we ran out of those little bags that it comes with, with the absorbent pad to help soak up the liquid, but in a pinch, sassy disposable diaper sacks work wonders!!), and that way when we get the opportunity to pull over there's no wasting time trying to set it up while she does the potty dance. Not sure how it works with boys yet, as my youngest boy has not potty trained yet, but time will tell.Here's what I like:-convenience. I don't have to worry about trying to find someplace with a public restroom to take her in. I can quickly get her on it, take out the used bag, replace it with a new one, and be on the go again in no time.-portability. It doesn't take up much space at all when it is folded up and it fits fairly well in my diaper bag, and j
B0016KV73W We have been so pleased with our &#34;travel potty.&#34;  It is so compact and perfect for traveling.  It fits easily in a backpack or large purse so you can use it anywhere.
B0016KV73W We have tried so many potty seats that I've lost count.  This one is by far the BEST.  It is compact and fits in my 2 year old's little backpack.  It is very sturdy, and she's comfortable because she does feel like she is falling in.  It cleans up easily, travels well, and is cute.
B0016KV73W A friend had referred this product to me when she was potty training her son. It is small enough to take everywhere you go and big enough where the child is comfortable. I have two: one in the car (because who likes using the public restrooms?) and the other in my bathroom (because I have a small bathroom, no extra room for another toilet).
B0016KV73W I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0016KV73W This is really great and we have gotten lots of use from it! We have used it as a potty seat over toilet and it can also be used to keep in your car in case your child needs to use the potty. This is a great all in one potty seat and we really love it!
B0016KV73W With the reusable liner we have been able to use the 2-in-1 potette plus at home, in the car, and while traveling.  Great product.
B0016KV73W Love it! Easy to transport, fits in a backpack or handbag. So convenient for potty training on the go. Came in very handy when we went camping.
B0016KV73W I got two of these bc we were traveling and boy they were so uncomfortable.  After every time my toddler used it, you can see red marks on both sides of his thighs.We've only used it on top of the regular toilet seat, hadn't try it the other way like we were in the woods or something.
B0016KV73W This is a great small size and fits comfortably in my bag. I love using this when we are out in public. It folds out nicely where my 2-1/2 year old can hold on to it's handles and not the icky public toilet seat. I love how it folds up very small.  Great product
B0016KV73W This has saved us on road trips on the side of the road and on icky public toilets while out running errands.  Holds up well and I pretty much don't leave the house without it.
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to keep in car for going public places, but not small enough to fit in my purse or anything. It is extremely low to the ground when used as a stand-alone potty, so not very useful for that. Will do in a pinch, but my daughter is 3 and already about to outgrown ability to use it on ground.
B0016KV73W My daughter likes her little \"red potty\".  I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.  I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.  (It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)  The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.  I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).  I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.  I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!  I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.  That is by far the biggest plus!  Especially since my 2 yr old likes \"privacy\" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.  It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.
B0016KV73W I really like this product. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it looked so small. But we have used it in the public restrooms and at people's houses and it works great over a toilet. The arms fold out and click into place creating a sturdy seat. The arms also click into place creating a stool like seat for using without a toilet. We have not had the opportunity to try that out yet. As a travel potty it does fit well into a diaper bad. Surprisingly compact.
B0016KV73W We used this twice. It seriously was much easier to just hold my daughter over a public potty and wash our hands thoroughly than bring this in and take it with us. It's small, yes but it just wasn't fun to lug something else in and out of restaurants, the mall, etc. Plus I felt like we were just carrying germs around with us from one potty to another. It's sort of an unnecessary purchase unless you are using it for camping, the beach, etc. For public potties just use the potty.
B0016KV73W Lifesaver for a potty-training 3 year old who is still mostly resistant. This removes the fear of &#34;falling&#34; into the toilet plus the handles keep his tiny hands away from the germ infested seat.  Works great with the Potty Cover or Potty Topper (provides added layer of protection / barrier).  The portability is also a plus. This is a MUST-HAVE for potty training parents.
B0016KV73W Works great as a portable potty option.  My son is terrified of large public toilets and this makes him feel safe without me having to lug something large around.  The bag is great for keeping it thrown in my diaper bag.  The front is a little lower than his other one which has led to some unintentional spraying!  I have yet to try it as a travel potty.
B0016KV73W Our son hated kiddie potties.  He just went straight from diapers to the regular toilet.  I'm sure it would come in handy if you camped a lot, or traveled a lot, but it just didn't work for us.
B0016KV73W This potty seat is great! We use it daily in my son's bathroom at home, and it folds easily to take with us out of the house. It has fit every toilet seat we've put it on, with no problems. No touching germy public toilets! I can't say anything about using it as a portable potty since we've never tried it that way. But it was a great purchase, worth every penny!
B0016KV73W I bought this more to use on public toilets, and the ocassional stand along use.  My son isn't comfortable using it on the big toilet AT ALL.  I don't like that it sits on the very back of the toilet.  When his pants are pulled to the ankles, his legs then have to sit out straight, making sitting very awkward.  And I also can't tell whether he is 'pointed down' because his legs are in the way of me seeing.Perhaps this would be better to use in the back of a minivan or something during a long trip.  But I don't have a huge car, and I don't find it very useful for everyday shopping, errands, etc.
B0016KV73W Simply one of the best baby / kid products around. Folds and unfolds easily and works great as a stand-alone potty or an adaptor for a regular toilet. Lightweight and inexpensive, too.
B0016KV73W After a week of potty training at home I knew I had to venture out and have my son sit on a public toilet. The potette fits perfectly on all the public toilets I've tried it on but it does require some getting used to. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age but he fits fine on it but it took a few tries to get him seated properly so he doesn't pee all over the place. I thought I would use the seat as a travel potty for the car as well but I tried sitting my son on it as a toilet and he fell right through to the floor. Since he has been trained on a real toilet with a potty seat he just wasn't used to sitting so low to the ground with nothing to hold on to.While it has been a life saver in public places, it is a pain in the butt to carry around. We rarely use a stroller so it's not an option to throw it in the basket underneath. And I was trying to get away from using a diaper bag anymore since my son is now potty trained. But this potty is just too large to fit in any purse that I own. So it's back to carrying a diaper bag for now and hopefully I can teach my son to pee standing up soon :)
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!!! it is great for road side emergency potty breaks, fitting onto the toilets when we're out and about, also for at home when my daughter was potty training. I appreciate that it comes in it's own carrying bag so I don't have to store it in one of my own bags. Easy to clean and the bags that it is sold with are perfect.
B0016KV73W I love this one.  I looked at A LOT of portable potty seats when we got ready for potty training, and all of them seemed either too flimsy or too big.  This is the sturdy and relatively portable (depending on the size of your diaper bag).  I love that it can be used with the bags as a true travel potty as well as just a portable potty seat.
B0016KV73W This is okay.  I thought it would look a little more like a toilet, but it's working for my husband's half attempts at &#34;elimination communication.&#34;  He hates diaper changes and saw this as a way of training a four-month old to pee in a toilet.  I think it will likely be helpful when we really take on toilet training--especially for trips.
B0016KV73W This is GREAT for our newly potty training son. Fits great on a regular toilet lid for out and about, and easy to use for stand alone times (saved us at the beach from having to stand in a long line for the restroom for him). I love it and can't say enough great things about it. My only wish (and this is being super nit picky) is that the splash gaurd would be bigger (for boys). But that is just being super pic
B0016KV73W I love this thing. It was well worth the money spent. We use it all the time. It will adjust to fit any toilet and my daughter feels safe and secure using it. I hate using public restrooms, but this thing makes the whole process a little more palatable. I leave it in my car in a small bag (along with a little container of antibacterial wipes) and it goes into the stroller when we are the zoo, mall, church, etc. One of my favorite features---and one that you definitely can't tell from the image shown---is that when it is folded out, there are little handles for the kid to hold onto. My daughter loves that and I love it that she isn't gripping a public toilet. We haven't had to use it in the &#34;stand-alone&#34; position yet. Circumstances just haven't required it. But someone said that you can make your own bags for it by cuttting a sanitary pad in half, sticking it in a plastic grocery sack. The pad absorbs liquid and you just tie it up and toss. Sounds fine to me. I have a couple in my car in a little pouch for the time when that happens. Very happy with this purchase.
B0016KV73W I got this for my 2 year old who we'd just potty trained. I didn't want to get caught short in the car away from the bathroom, but I also didn't want a great big potty in the trunk of the car. This is great, it folds small. To use it as a travel potty, you click the legs, add the bag and away they pee (you can buy 'special bags' but a diaper bag with a bit of paper towel in the bottom would work as well.) I read some reviews that it collapses when the kids are on it, but if you click the legs in properly, it does not.To use on the toilet just extend the legs like the wings on a airplane, pop it on the seat and them on top.It folds small enough for the diaper bag too!
B0016KV73W Bought for traveling with twin 2-year-olds.  When placed on a regular toilet, this seat bends a bit at the seams when the kids sit on it.  This makes them feel unsteady.  They rejected it completely at first.  On a second trip, they were a bit more willing to try, but still not as comfortable as the Bjorn seats we use at home.  Very small when in the stand-alone position.  Might work better once they're actually potty trained instead of just starting.
B0016KV73W This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to find this potty. It was exactly what we needed for being on the go, as my son doesn't like to use toilets yet. The major drawback though is that when my son goes pee, the pee goes everywhere since there isn't an effective splash guard. Otherwise, this is great for #2. We haven't yet tried it over the big toilet since my son prefers a potty and is a bit fearful of toilets, even with this over the seat.
B0016KV73W I have one in each of our cars and one in the stroller. Our nanny hates going to public restroom in the part because a lot of homeless people go there so she will use the potette every day letting our daughter do her business in the park. The bags are a bit expensive but grocery bags so often have holes I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have also used it in restaurants when they have no seat liner and I still put some toilet paper on the toilet seat towards the front that the potette doesn't cover. Many times we have pulled over or exit freeway to find a parking lot where my daughter can go potty. One times she did it inside our car but she bent her leg too high and the pee kinda squirt out of the potette so I make sure she straighten her legs when she as to pee. Overall it is a great product. You do have to make sure the legs snap in place when using as a chair. IMO, even if I only use it once it is totally worth the money so my daughter doesn't have to touch any dirty toilet seat or when she needs to go while we are driving somewhere.
B0016KV73W This was a lifesaver at the beach while my daughter was potty training. I highly recommend it. Works great on its own or as a potty seat on an adult toilet. Great purchase.
B0016KV73W My 3 year old is very afraid of going to a loud public bathroom. This has come in handy every time we go out. I do t buy the bags and found if I just use a plastic bag (like target thick bags) with some paper towels it works perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone with a toddler
B0016KV73W We keep one of these in the back of our SUV.  It's a perfect solution to when you LO needs to go and you don't have a toilet to use or for potty training.  It's small enough to fit in a diaper bag, pool bag, beach bag.  Goes everywhere with us!  And the liners are a must have.  They make it super clean and easy!
B0016KV73W This portable toilet is GREAT!! It is easy to set up, thoguh I never use it on adult public toilets, it feels gross. I can set it up in any corner, even at the mall and no one knows. The bags are biodegradable which is also great. They have absorbent pads in them to hold the pee too. It is small and has a bag to carry. Really a must for any one with small kids!
B0016KV73W We keep this in the bottom of the stroller and it has saved us many times.Early on in potty training, it came in quite handy when our toddler had the sudden need to go to the bathroom and there was no restroom.  This quickly opens and solves that problem.We also use it often on public toilets.  Not only is it more hygienic, but also much less scary for our toddler than using some strange new toilet in a strange public restroom.It is a bit frustrating to pay for the extra bags.  They look just like plastic shopping bags with a swatch of paper towel inside.  However, the difference is that these bags never have any holes.  When you are carrying a bag full of urine to the trash can, you'll be happy it is the Kalencom bag that never leaks.
B0016KV73W This portable potty is wonderful -- it fits on every toilet we've tried (very old, small, round toilets can be a bit of an issue, but then you can fit it on the bowl instead of on the seat and it still works just fine), and it works as a portable stand-alone potty as well. It folds up small enough that it isn't annoying to bring it everywhere -- even on airplanes -- and is very sturdy!And with the high weight limit (96lbs), I have no worries about my son (30lbs at 22mos) outgrowing the seat before he's done potty-training.
B0016KV73W We always tell my son to &#34;point down&#34; when he pees, but it still will spray out of this. There is a gap between the set cover and the actual seat so I wish it would go down further to prevent sprays. Overall it is a decent product and good for quick trips to the potty, and taking in public.
B0016KV73W This was a potty training piece of awesomeness. Flexible for traveling, and easy for our 20 month old to sit on. During her 3 day potty training weekend we kept this handy, carrying from room to room, for &#34;pit stops.&#34; It saved our floors from a lot of extra scrubbing. I call it our porta-potty as it goes everywhere with us for potty time emergencies (we've used it by the side of the road, in a park, in the back of our SUV...) and also as her toilet ring seat in public restrooms. It folds up and fits in its own carrying bag along with a spare set of training pants and small pack of flushable wipes. That kit in turn fits in my tote bag or beneath the stroller. Regular grocery bags work fine, just make sure they don't have any little holes in them!
B0016KV73W This is the best $10 I have ever spent!One week after my son turned 2, he decided that he was going to use the toilet and no more diapers.  While I applauded his desire and determination, I had a feeling the &#34;ability&#34; might take a bit of time to perfect.  So, after seeing the &#34;special potties for using on the go&#34; in one of his potty books, I took to Amazon to find out what these on the go potties are.  For $10, I decided to try the potette plus--and have now purchased 3 potette plus-es!These things are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They are little folding 'potties' that can be set up as a small potty OR (bonus!) placed upon a full sized adult toilet seat to make it child sized.  The legs easily snap into place to set the potette up as a potty and easily extend out to use as a child's seat on the adult toilet.  It is the PERFECT size for the &#34;mommy, I have to potty&#34;, as soon as you make your turn onto a busy street--you can easily pull off into the closest parking lot or parking space, set up the potty on the car seat, floor, hatchback, folded down seat, what have you, so that junior can make his pee pee, after telling you for the 5000th time before you left the house 1 minute earlier that he did not have to go.Pros:  Fits perfectly in the diaper bag where we used to keep the changing padEasy to set up and use; for a portable potty, stick in one of the included liners (replacements are available for a reasonable price too--they look like plastic grocery bags with an absorbent pad at the bottom), and prop up the potty for junior to use (we keep it set up in the car--we fold down the front passenger seat and let junior sit on his throne on the folded seat.  It's saved us many a time from an 'unforeseen car seat incident' as grandpa would call it.  Also perfect for bathroom-less parks, the beach, or anyplace else that your little one has to go while &#34;on the go&#34;.  Once junior does his business in the disposable liner, you remove the bag, tie up the handles, toss it in the trash and go about your day.Easy to use on the adult potty.  My little guy was public restroom (or any restroom that was not at home) a-phobic.  He REFUSED to use toilets that were not his own, which made leaving the house while potty training extra fun.  After we got the potette, every toilet seat looks alike! (because the potette is nicely propped on top and that is all the little one sees).The legs/handles keep junior from grabbing those germ infested toilet seats in public restrooms to hold on--he can just hang on to the legs/handles of the potette plus and keep his precious hands free from public toilet yucks.Cons:  We didn't realize that the legs snapped up into the potette to stabilize it when used as a potty.  We learned that after a couple of wobbly attempts.  Make sure that you snap the legs in place when using as a free standing potty.Overall, it has made potty training a breeze.  We never had to spend those long dreaded weekends at home because junior was learning to use the toilet.  We just bring the potette plus with us and he's good to go &#34;on the go&#34;.  We keep 1 in each car and 1 in the diaper bag.  It seems like nothing brings on the urge to potty like getting strapped into the car seat and pulling out of the neighborhood.
B0016KV73W I carried this potty in my purse (it barely fit) while my daughter was potty training. I hardly had to use it, but it was good to have. I carried plastic grocery bags and napkins to put at the bottom of the bag to absorb pee.Negatives:- It takes more than a few seconds to set-up, so if she really needs to go, she might not make it, and you're breaking a sweat.- She has to be okay with sitting down on plastic, because the plastic bag wraps around the seat.- The folding out and collapsing of the legs could improve in designPositives:- portable- pink- can use grocery bags and then throw away immediately
B0016KV73W This is a very good product for girls.  It's easy to use, fits well inside the toilet and my daughter has something to hold on to.
B0016KV73W This product is amazing. It gives me piece of mind that my kids (and I!) will always have where to go. Is true that you gotta make sure that the legs of the potty SNAP securely before your child sits on it (I forgot to do this the very first time and the potty collapsed on one side), so make sure it snaps in place. I attached a picture of how the potty looks on a public toilet. It is sturdy for my 2 year old... even tho I still put some toilet paper on the toilet UNDER my potette just in case LOL. Fits my diaper bag, which is normal size... I love this thing.
B0016KV73W I love this potty seat, it's small and convenient.  My daughter does not hesitate to get up on it in a public restroom.  It fits on the toilet and does not move around, I have found this true on all shapes of toilets.  The rubber handles holds it in place.  I have not used it on the &#34;go&#34; where it stands on his own but it seems sturdy enough if it had to be used that way.  It's small enough that it fits in a small diaper bag.  The rubber handles fold up into the seat to make it smaller.
B0016KV73W We keep this potty in the car. My daughter is 2, and she loves it. You can just use a grocery bag and a paper towel, but I would double the plastic bag.
B0016KV73W Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.
B0016KV73W Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.
B0016KV73W My child is scared of &#34;big potties&#34;. When we are on the road or out shopping, this is the lifesaver for &#34;I have to pee now daddy!&#34;. We love it.
B0016KV73W I bought it for my two years old girl. We used it in an airplane, in restaurants rest rooms, in a back of our car, on a toilets anywhere we go and it is always with us. Very small and comfortable to care in a bag. I purchased a waterproof diaper bag for this potty so I fill very comfortable to care it around.
B0016KV73W This saved us from having to find a place for our toddler to go potty in the middle of a family friendly Mardi Grass parade! My girl is also scared of public toilets that have seats that are open at the front edge (which is almost every public toilet seat) so we have had a hard time using public toilets until we got this seat :) Super compact, it will fit inside our backpack! and leave plenty of space for the rest of the things my newborn needs! It comes with a plastic bag so I can just wipe it clean and put it in the bag and it won't touch anything else inside the backpack! We also bought the reusable rubber liner and with both of them we are set to go anywhere! We use this for our adventures out and about and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my baby's buns and little hands won't touch any nasty public restroom toilet seat.
B0016KV73W I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.  I LOVE this little seat.  It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!  For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.  This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a \"dollar\" store).  You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.  One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.  Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.  This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.  The \"carry bag\" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.  I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.  The seat can fit either direction.  The only \"negatives\" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).  If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).  This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.  We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.  I use the same 4 gallon bags.  This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for \"urine pads\" and bags.  The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.  The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.  Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.
B0016KV73W My 2 year old Weighs about 30 lbs and can use this easily! Very portable and light weight! He has learned how to pee standing up thanks to his daddy so when we are in public restrooms, I find the lowest toilet seat then use this as a stepping stool for him and he can go. I'm holding on to him the entire time since his pants are down to his knees amd he can't balance well that way but it does the trick. We will be using this for the beach this summer!Another note, the storage bag that it comes in is plastic so I would recommend buying a medium wetbag (the type you use to put wet cloth diapers in) to use as a permanent storage in diaper bag instead.Great and sturdy!
B0016KV73W My 7 month old happily sits on this potty and does his business.  It fits nicely on any regular toilet making clean up a breeze - just flush!
B0016KV73W If you want to go anywhere for more than 30 minutes when potty training, you need something like this.  The things I didn't like about this particular device:  it is too low to the ground and the seat is small, the feet don't stay put unless you snap them in which isn't easy to do (my daughter tipped over twice before I realized how to do it), it requires buying refill bags, I'm not sure we're inserting the bags correctly, and it isn't clear which direction the kids should sit.  While small, it is too big for our older model Valco stroller basket so we have to hang it from the handlebar.  I may try another kind of travel potty, but until then we'll continue to take this on walks and in the car.  It gets the job done.
B0016KV73W We were somewhat nervous about how to go about a day with our toddler, as we are on the go quite a bit in busy New York City.This has made the transition to diaper free so easy, especially as I have a phobia of public toilets. I use it with regular plastic bags (the type you get at grocery stores) and it works well.  Folds easily, and we've used it both for travel and on the go. Well made.
B0016KV73W This thing is AMAZING. We literally use it every day when we are out. we use it at restaurants, parks, the back of my car.. EVERYWHERE. Highly recommend.
B0016LVB4Q So worth the buy - super soft, great quality and washes well... get two so you always have one on hand! Again 'Carters rocks'!
B0016LVB4Q So So So SOFT!!! Love this item so much, i purchased another one! Great quality and my little boy seems to like the softness.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover. its very soft and is easy to get on and off the changing pad. only problem is that sometimes while changing my daughter she likes to pee and this doesn't absorb any moisture and it runs off onto the floor.
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this is! The color is great, the bumps really aren't a problem and it is easy to put on and take off.
B0016LVB4Q love this changing pad cover. decided to buy the carters brand after purchasing a major retail store brand cover, which was not soft at all. carters is the best for all things baby. love it, baby loves it too. its not rough on her skin, for when she rolls to the side as i change her. i would def. recommend , and would guy again.
B0016LVB4Q We've been using this pad (in Ecru) for nearly a year and it's held up really well. It's soft and the ecru is a nice color that seems to wash pretty well. I always keep it covered with one of theseCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecrupads on top of it. Makes messes very easy to clean up. I also got a similar BOPPY cover in sage. I prefer the Carter's Ecru one though.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best diaper changing cover.  They wash up great as well.  I actually use them over the mini co-sleeper as well - they fit it perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q Changing pad cover is great.  We have 2 so we can wash one and have one on the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this changing pad is!  It also holds up well to multiple washings and dryings.  It's very pretty addition to my nursery.
B0016LVB4Q Love the mute color and dots! Super soft and it is going to look great with my crib bedding, neutral and pristine.
B0016LVB4Q The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!
B0016LVB4Q This fits well over the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad that we ordered, and is really nice and soft without being too plush. I haven't washed it a lot, but seems like the quality will hold up through multiple washings. The color was a nice neutral, not too pink or yellow as some Ecrus tend to get. Good product for the price.
B0016LVB4Q So soft and fits the changing pad well, even has cut outs for the changing pad straps. Only wish I would have got more than one.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and super cute! I washed the pad cover and kept its softness and fits my chaning pad cover great. I love the light pink color. I would def. order more covers from Carters.
B0016LVB4Q Another quality product from Carter's. These hold up well in the wash, and are super soft. They fit all standard changing pads very well. I would also suggest using a changing pad liner over this cover - so if your baby has a blow-out you are cleaning up, you don't have to change this cover every time!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and washes really well.  We have three of these and wash them all the time and after 9 months they still look new and actually seem even softer (and they were soft to begin with).  We have it in off white.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best changing pad ever. It is super soft and durable. Easy to wash and holds up great. Haven't had any problems with it so far.
B0016LVB4Q great quality, great color.  no complaints on this one!  I like the velour type covers for changing table over other stuff.
B0016LVB4Q This fit our summer infant changing pad. Very soft cover and easy to put on and take off. Looks sharp in our nursery with the soft dots.
B0016LVB4Q This showed up exactly as I expected and as pictured.  It is soft and durable.  I would definitely reccomend this item to other moms.
B0016LVB4Q Very happy with the cover! It looks great in the room and it is just so darn soft!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is soft, durable, and fits the changing pad great! If it's anything like Carter's sheets, it's going to hold up for a LONG time as well! Great product. Very happy!
B0016LVB4Q Its great, baby loves it, contoured sides give secure feeling to squirmy baby. Fits LA Baby 4 sided changing pad 32&#34;. I bought &#34;pink&#34; ;-)
B0016LVB4Q I agree with the other reviewers:  this is a superb cover in terms of softness, fit, quality, etc.  However, if you are on the fence about what kind of changing pad cover to get, hold off.  Ours spends more time in the washing machine because of spit up and other wonders of baby changing, so we end up using receiving blankets and cloth diapers over our changing pad a lot of the time.  If you have the money, get two.  If you would rather save some money, this is one of those items that you can scratch off of your list.  I love this particular cover, just not the impracticality of covers in general.
B0016LVB4Q Super SoftEasy to care forDoesn't shrinkNice Calm sage color (goes well in our nursery)Hasn't changed over time and I've washed mine enough timesI only bought one and it's been fine.
B0016LVB4Q I purchased this cover in Chocolate for a Serta changing pad. It is so soft, my baby loves to be put down on it. She gets all smiley and just loves the feeling. The elasticized edges fit the Serta pad perfectly. I decided to buy a back up cover in Sage and was very pleased at how the cover didn't stain. I was afraid with a lighter color that spit up and accidents might leave stains but my worries were unfounded. Great cover, I'll probably buy another soon!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so ridiculously soft, I love it!!!  The chocolate color looks slightly washed out, but I love the way it feels!!!  I am definitely buying a couple more to keep on hand so that I will always have a clean one handy, but decided to go with the baby blue color.  I am thinking that my espresso colored baby furniture may have something to do with my not liking the chocolate color. . . it's all too dark.  I know baby will be so comfy during his diaper changes.  Also fits our infant summer contoured changing pad perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B0016LVB4Q We couldn't ask for anything softer. This is an excellent changing pad cover and it holds up very well wash after wash.
B0016LVB4Q This is the perfect changing pad cover. It washes well and is super soft for my babies skin. The cover does not fit too tight so it is easy to take off and put back on my changing pad. Plus the brown color matches my son's room perfectly. Would change nothing about this product.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this cover to use with the  Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad, also purchased on Amazon.  I was very impressed with both products being decent value and high quality.  This is the softest material changing pad and is soo adorable to add to our nursery.  Glad I found this!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and cleans up well.  I recommend getting waterproof lap pads to put under baby's bottom otherwise you may be washing the cover more than you want (especially with newborns who will often continue their diaper destruction with the diaper off!).  We also have the Ecru and are pleased with both colors.  Would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q We have this changing pad cover in 3 colors. It is very soft, and holds up well in the wash: messes come out without special treatment, and after 3 months of being laundered several times a week is still as soft as the first day we used it. It fits our changing pad well, has elastic all the way around (not just the corners), and has slots for the changing pad's safety harness.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft, I'm sure my baby will love snuggling into it.  Can't wait for him to use it.
B0016LVB4Q We purchased this to cover the Summer Infant changing pad. It fit perfectly, super soft, easy to wash and still in great shape a year and a half later.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft and fits the changing pad perfectly!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I might order an extra one for when this one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q We used this to cover our summer infant bassinet pad, that we use in our Graco mini pack and play.  These sheets fit perfectly.  We also use them in rotation on our changed pad on the changing table.
B0016LVB4Q Love it! Super soft, looks great and fits changing pad perfectly! I washed it many times on hot/cold and the color seems to hold.
B0016LVB4Q Love these changing pad covers! I had one of these, and one of another brand. I liked this one so much, I went and bought a second, and discarded the other one I had. They're cute, soft, and have held up great so far. We have a contour pad with 3 raised sides, and they fit perfectly. My son is 10 months old, and we've used these covers since birth.
B0016LVB4Q I love the super soft fabric. We use this withLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32\", Whiteand it fits perfect!
B0016LVB4Q These changing pads are exactly as described.  They are super soft, and wick away moisture easily. I also like the ecru color as it blends easily with any decor.
B0016LVB4Q As it says this product is very soft.  Went on very easily and looks great in the nursery, happy with my purchase.
B0016LVB4Q We've used this cover 6 1/2 months.  So glad we spent the extra few dollars for this nicer-looking cover.  It's color looks like the picture, it's durable--have washed it half a dozen times.  We use a waterproof pad liner on top of it, but it seems it would hold up well regardless.  We have the Diaper Genie changing pad and its wide straps do not fit through the strap holes in this cover.  Also, the holes are so near the cover's edge that the holes are underneath the pad.  And the Diaper Genie straps come out the side of the pad.  So we just ended up not using the holes.  Eventually I'll get around to sewing a new hole where it should be for our pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love this cover...so I bought two more to keep on hand.  It is so soft and fits my pad nicely.  Highly recommend, especially ove regular cotton covers.
B0016LVB4Q This is so soft it is so nice for my baby. It is always warm which is great for the baby. Washes great, washed mine at least 10 times and still looks brand new. Love the color, doesnt show any stains inbetween washes.
B0016LVB4Q Nice changing pad, super soft!  Well, I can tell you with 100% accuracy that this washes very well and it is still super-soft even after all these washings.  Fits well on the changing pad and easy to put on/take off. Glad we have some of these!
B0016LVB4Q We love love this! super soft, easy to wash & come on brown is perfect. Bought 2 but I think I'm going to get a third
B0016LVB4Q This is a great changing pad cover. It's incredibly soft and washes really well. I have bought a lot of Carter's velour stuff and have been happy every time with it! Their velour crib sheets are also amazing.
B0016LVB4Q This is sooo soft! And it's adorable, washable, and comfy. I highly recommend to anyone to buy this product. It is wonderful
B0016LVB4Q THe cover is soft, easy to clean and has lasted two years and is still going strong with baby number two!
B0016LVB4Q This is a must have (in any color) for a baby nursery.  These covers are soft and comfortable and they hold up to lots of washes!
B0016LVB4Q We own two of this changing pad cover in the \"chocolate\" color.  (My goal was to always have one clean, in case the other got dirty during a changing.)  They are incredibly soft.Despite dozens of washings, they look pretty much new.  No fading, no thinning of the material.Highly recommended.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and cute!! Seems very durable and color is true to description. I was concerned about it not conforming to the changing pad I have as  it has raised edges but no issues.
B0016LVB4Q These changing pad covers are wonderful.  I currently have two changing pads,Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing PadandSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  This cover fits both perfectly.Before I purchased these, my baby hated to have her diaper changed.  She never complained about having her diaper changed again after I started using the Carters' Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover.They are amazingly soft and have not been damaged by the washing machine (on gentle cycle) or the dryer.  I would recommend these changing pad covers to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q Love this, own it in a variety of colors. These are SO soft, look great in the nurery, and still look and feel wonderful after many washes. They fit my long changing pad quite nicely. You can find cheaper pads, but to me this is worth the price, I feel it is very comfortable for my baby and it's holding up nicely.
B0016LVB4Q This comes exactly as shown a bright brown and super soft to the touch. My 4 month old loves to run his hands along the &#34;bumps&#34; in the material!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover fits securely and is very soft. Perfect for the babies room. Very delicate to the touch.
B0016LVB4Q This has held up well over the last year. Washed tons of times and still as soft and cute as ever!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is fantastic.  It is so soft and feels great to the touch while the raised dots give it just the right amount of texture.  Baby is sure to love it! The pink is a beautiful color that is sure to complement the decor of just about any girl's room.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is great. it is soft and plush. it goes great with the colors of our nursery. its chocolate color that you see in the picture is true to the color that it really is. you should always have 2 covers and i would order two of this cover in a heartbeat.
B0016LVB4Q We love this changing pad cover. We got 2. It is so plush and comfy for baby. Very soft and makes the room look nice. Looks much more expensive than others on the market. I have zero complaints and would absolutely buy this again. I've washed it over and over the last 5 months and no signs of wear.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and the size is perfect for fitting over a 16\" x 32\" pad.  Great to have an extra on hand for when one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q Fits over my summer infant changing pad perfectly even after multiple washes & drys in hot.  It's very soft and the dots add a nice texture.  The brown is a rich deep color.  Looks great with my espresso crib!
B0016LVB4Q Doesn't soak through, cleans up well, still looks great & fits great even after a handfull of accidents and washes.  Plus it's cute.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and comfy, better than others out there- buy several as tehy get dirty frequently! a must have for baby
B0016LVB4Q This changing cover is the perfect shade of pale pink for our nursery. I really didn't want anything too bright as we've used all pastel colors. It seems very soft and fits our old changing pad from pottery barn kids. Will be ordering a couple more to have back ups.
B0016LVB4Q My daughter really likes this changing cover. It is soft and warm for her many diaper changes. It washes nicely and doesn't require any special instructions. I think I am going to get it in another color too.
B0016LVB4Q I had hoped that this cover would be nice, and I am not let down. Very soft, and it fits the changing pad mattress perfectly. Thank you!Edit: I ordered the Graco Travel Lite Crib (more like a cross between a small pack n play & bassinet though) for our baby & someone suggested using this Super Soft Dot Cover to cover the Summer Infant Bassinet Pad that I got to go inside it. I was not let down! It not only fits the pad perfectly, it is so super soft against baby's skin too! I love it so much that I ordered another one to switch them out when one is being washed. I now own the chocolate, ecru, and sage colored ones, and am contemplating getting the pink one too. These are so perfect for both changing table pad cover & bassinet pad cover alike!!!!! All of the above mentioned can be found here on Amazon.
B0016LVB4Q My baby loves laying on his changing pad, even when not being changed because this is so soft and comfy! It fits our changing pad just right (elastic around the whole bottom). The color is nice and neutral, but just make sure to wash it with like colors or it will slightly change colors.
B0016LVB4Q I love the \"minky\" fabric that this changing cover is made with. It is super soft, a great soft pink color, and it washes well. I even put it in the dryer and it didn't shrink or change the fabric at all. Very nice cover for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have 1 sage & 1 pink cover that we've been using for a little over 13 months and they are still in PERFECT condition.We have twin girls which means twice the diaper changes which means twice the chance of these getting soiled & needing washed. Especially when they were newborns they liked to pee all over once we got their diapers off. These have been washed a TON of times, both on delicate & regular cycle & then on regular in the dryer and they show no signs of wear, still look like new, still have the raised dots and are still super soft! They also slip easily over our changing pad.If you have twins or more, I definately recommend getting at least 2 of these, maybe more. Also, you can get the mini water resistant pads(quite a few) and put that under babys bottom when you change them...then if they pee or if they're being really honery and poo, you just have to change the soiled pad & not this cover. You can also buy the water resistant pads meant for a crib and cut them small enough to use for the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Soft.  Nice color.  Fits great.  The dots are dots.  Nothing special about them.  What else can I say, it works.
B0016LVB4Q Love it!  This changing pad cover is so soft and plush feeling.  I have had this for several months now and it has not shrunk and still looks new.  I have espresso finish for the crib set in my babies room and this matches with the furniture so well.  Highly recommend!
B0016LVB4Q Nice color, soft sheets, appears to be a quality product. However, took forever to receive. Got these to match Carson's chocolate velour crib sheets, and its a perfect match.
B0016LVB4Q True color (it's a pale sage green).  Very soft and fit the standard changing pad perfect.  We are very happy with the purchase.
B0016LVB4Q This is a soft cover and I love the texture. It washes well and I dryed on low to avoid shrinkage.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  This changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this to match the crib bumpers. Just like the bumper the fabric is super soft. I do not have a contoured changing pad but rather a flat one and this fits perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q I love these!  I bought two (one for the changing station, and one for her bassinet) They're soft and easy to wash.
B0016LVB4Q Great changing pad cover. It is super soft, easy to wash, pretty, and durable. There is nothing more you can really want from a cover. It has holdes for the straps, which we don't use, but they are there if you need them.My baby loves the texture on them and likes to run her hands over the little soft bumps as I change her. Good to have something else distract her so I have an extra few seconds for the diapers change.Most importantly, it has lasted many many many washes.There are plenty of colors. We have sage and pink and like them both (good tones, not too bright, match with everything we have).
B0016LVB4Q Really like this pad cover for the following reasons:- it's soft and baby likes it- it's easy to wash- lasted for 3+ yrs and 2 kids and it looks/feels exactly the same; also does not shrinkgood buy.
B0016LVB4Q It fits the changing pad well, has slits for the safety straps, and cleans up easily in the washing machine.  No weird smells or itchy bits.
B0016LVB4Q Love the feel of this. Much better than the rough terry fabric seen on most changing pad covers. My baby notices the difference.
B0016LVB4Q this is so soft and they make crib sheets in the same fabric and its so soft. best cover i've found yet.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad it's sooooo soft and comfy. My baby is very comfortable resting when I'm changing her diaper. Would recommend this product especially for winter. I order several because they can be used as bassinet sheets!!!!
B0016LVB4Q Love love love this! I need to buy more so when I wash this one I have another to replace it (hello blowouts). So soft be my baby loves laying on her changer. If I left her there all day I'm sure she'd love it. Ha!
B0016LVB4Q I really like this cover, wish I could buy sheets for the crib just as this one. It looks and feels great.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric is very soft, and I haven't had a problem getting stains out of it. I had bought a rather large changing pad and was afraid this wouldn't fit, but in fact it fits quite well. The photo of the sage color is a little misleading; I would describe it as more of a forest-y green.
B0016LVB4Q These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.
B0016LVB4Q This cover has worked really well on our changing pad. It's ultra soft (our cat likes to use it as a napping spot) and it soaks up leaks quickly without letting them get all over everything. It also has held up well so far to our washing machine (we've used it for about a month). Plus, the chocolate color is great and the raised dots are cute. It goes on and off our changing pad with ease, and stays on well. I recommend having two pad covers so that you can wash one cover and still have another one to use.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric color and texture is great. Fits my changing table pad perfectly and is easy to remove to clean!
B0016LVB4Q this is not only soft and beautiful but it washes well and holds up well over time.  My baby is now 6 months old and the covers all still look brand new after 6 months of washing and drying
B0016LVB4Q For my first son I only used the terrycloth covers, but decided to try this out for my second son: I love them!  They looks nice after being washed (on hot) and after going through the dryer (on medium heat) and they fit my 4-sided changing pad very well.  Will buy more of these for sure!
B0016LVB4Q I love these- soft, well made, pretty sage color.  I bought two with our first child.  Bought a third with our second.  Two would probably do, as I use the changing table less- and the living room floor more!  But, don't mind, as these are great.  Durable, too, with all the washing, and will be able to pass long to my sister when she has kids.
B0016LVB4Q I own three of these since I'm constantly changing them out. They're very soft and fit my changing pad great. I wish that they had a better selection of colors though.
B0016LVB4Q Easy to wash, and super fluffy. Our 2 month old loves it! I would strongly recommend to anyone in search of a new changing pad cover.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is SUPER soft and fits perfectly on my changing pad (Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad). It even has slits so the buckles can come through. I've used it for a year and washed several times and have had no problems. This is a great quality pad.
B0016LVB4Q I was mostly worried about this shedding in the wash. So far, it has held up amazingly well, even washing in hot water with diapers. When I worked in a daycare, we just used a bare changing pad, and wiped down after every change. While that works in an institutional setting, I wanted something a little cozier for my own baby. This is super soft and works in cold and warm temperature to keep baby comfortable on the changing pad. We do a lot on our changing table besides just diaper changes. Giving vitamins, cleaning ears and nose, washing hands and face, singing songs, learning about body parts, even baby massage. The changing table is a bonding place for me and my baby. So it's worth it to me to have such a nice surface for baby to lay on. On the practical side, it does a decent job of repelling minor &#34;spills&#34; so in the event of an accident, I can get baby off the table and pull the cover off before anything undesirable soaks through to the pad, giving me a bigger mess to clean up. The cover goes right in the laundry, a quick wipedown of the pad, and I'm ready to put a new cover on. In fact, I bought two, so my changing pad never goes &#34;naked&#34; while one is in the wash.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad cover. It's soft and cozy so my daughter doesn't mind lying on it while I change her. It's easy to wash and has held up nicely for me so far.
B0016LVB4Q This is such a soft changing pad cover. I love minky anything and this is no different. It matches the nursery decor perfectly
B0016LVB4Q This is a very nice changing pad cover. It's soft, pretty colored, and thick and luxurious feeling. My only word of advice is to check out the harder-to-find on Amazon Carter's giraffe printed one before buying this one. We got both to have a spare, but really only needed one. The giraffe one is truly awesome.
B0016LVB4Q You cannot go wrong with this brand, the texture is soft, the color is perfect for a little girls room and fits all standard changing pads.
B0016LVB4Q The material on this changing pad is SOFT. We've only been using it for a short time but it gets washed frequently. There has been no degradation after all the times it's been through the washer and dryer. I'd highly recommend this over a generic brand, it'll last.
B0016N3SF4 My daughter loves this in the bath with her.  They are very cute and a fun toy that we also gave as a gift and that child loved as well.
B0016N3SF4 super cute and just love the floaties.  great price, made a perfect baby shower gift, gender neutral makes it an easy pick
B0016N3SF4 We used this as a diaper cake topper for my sisters baby shower. Her theme obviously rubber duckies. Perfect decor and baby bath toy after. Very happy.
B0016N3SF4 Looks very elegant. The classic rubber duck!  Baby loves it and it just beautifies he bath. Good material - seems durable. Lovely colors.
B0016N3SF4 From the moment I saw these froggies on my friends baby's pictures I fell in love with them. I ordered this toy, and loved it even more after seeing it in person. My 9 months old daughter loves to play with baby frogs, and to chew on the floaties. She even snuck one of the floaties to her crib a couple of times. A very cute, well-made, functional toy.
B0016NMIOG Love these!  My 22 month old son loves to feed himself,and these are the perfect size for him.  I never toss them, just wash them in the dishwasher.  I love the carrying case, we put it in the diaper bag.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib several days ago and it was a cinch to put together.  It looks great and half the price of the oeuf baby cribs.
B0016RSDYG I don't think you can find better quality for the money if you're looking for a modern crib.  Love this crib.  Our daughter's nursery is mid-century modern-ish and this works perfectly in it.
B0016RSDYG This is one sleek looking crib that has a decent price tag for it's design. It's well made and pretty easy to assemble. You will find that once you convert it to the toddler bed, it looks even more attractive! It fits a regular sized crib mattress and has no moving parts (which can be tough for short moms who have to lower sleeping babies.If you'd like a complete crib buying guide, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under 'baby gear essentials'.

B0016RSEG8 This mattress fit perfectly in ourDelta Children's Products Riley Mini Crib - Dark Cherry. If you are looking for sheets and waterproof pad, I highly recommend theNaturepedic Organic Cotton Portable Crib Fitted Sheet, Ivoryand theNaturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38. They all fit together. The mattress, waterproof pad, and fitted sheet are all that we use in the crib and it works nicely and comfortably for our little one. It was difficult at first to find a smaller crib and all the appropriately sized crib items while also meeting or exceeding all the safety recommendations, so to find this combo was a relief.
B0016RSEG8 I want everything to be healthy for the little one!  I bought for my grandson as a gift for his new mini crib.  He likes it and enjoys to stand on it inside his crib!
B0016RSEG8 It fits out portable crib very tightly and is of a high quality...I would recommend it again. Just as described.
B0016RSEG8 Spent a long time trying to find an organic mattress that I thought I would be happy with. This one fits our Alpha Mini Rocking Crib very well. Snug, but not hard to get the sheets on. Wipes down easily. Seems very firm enough. Very very light so it's easy to pull out and put a new sheet on. Went with American Baby Company SheetsAmerican Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Portable Fitted Crib Sheet, NaturalandAmerican Baby Company Organic Fitted Cotton Velour Porta-Crib Sheet, Natural. Not please with the Naturepedic waterproof pad. Too hard to get it to sit flat under the sheet while putting the sheet on. Also skipped the padded quilted organic waterproof mattress pad since I thought it made the bedding too soft. Am just going to use sheets and maybe flannel waterproof protectors over them if the kids end up needing them.
B0016RSEG8 I have this mattress for the crib and bought the same one for our porta crib/pack and play.  I love the Naturpedic line and the product they sell.  I was so happy to find a mattress to fit the pack and play from them too.  It's nice and thick, super comfy for my twin boys.  They have slept in this from the time I brought them home until they stopped late day naps at 7 months old.  Now at 10 months the mattress is the bottom of the pack and play and as they are pulling up and standing and then dropping back down to sitting, they land on something soft and comfy instead of hard.  They get in and play and are able to stand up on the mattress since it's nice and firm.  Would recommend this for anywhere between newborn age to any age still using a porta crib for sleep or playtime.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress seems comfortable and it wipes cleans well. It fit nicely in our portable crib.  Happy with this purchase.
B0016RSEG8 We bought a full size Naturepedic organic mattress for our toddler's crib when he was born almost 2 years ago, and it's been the best purchase.  So when shopping for a mattress for the mini-crib his sister will be sleeping in, I knew I wanted another Naturepedic.  So many other organic mattresses are more expensive because they are made with wool and latex - 2 things I happen to be allergic to.  I liked that this one is made from something I feel is safe for my baby to sleep on, and I feel the price is fair after actually seeing how well it works in our crib.This portacrib pad/mattress fits the DaVinci/Baby Mod mini cribs perfectly.  Our  mini crib came with a mattress that was horrible (although the cribs are great), it had gaps between the side and the mattress, and the mattress itself was flimsy and covered in vinyl.  This Naturepedic mattress fits great, with a nice tight fit, and it's firm enough for a newborn.  It's much sturdier and even half an inch thicker than the mattress provided by our crib manufacturer.  I know some reviewers were worried that it's only 2 inches thick, and it's labeled as a \"pad\", but it is a mattress, and very high quality.I highly recommend this mattress, and in case you're wondering, we've found that the Carter's Portacrib Sheets fit it perfectly.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress is thin and is firm and I wouldn't want to sleep on it but my baby loves it. It is made of cotton so I can see that some of them may have bunches because sometimes that happens with these organic products. If you were to get one of those, I would exchange it because ours was even throughout the mattress.-Firm and safe, fits in my davinci mini crib tight and perfect-Water proof and easy to wipe off-It is just about all my 2 month old will sleep on (now 13.5 lbs and 24 in long)-Yes it works as a mattress alone, it may seem thin but it may be because we as adults would see it as very uncomfortable
B0016RVLZY I was disappointed to learn that the core of Naturepedic bassinet pads are made of \"30% polyethylene foam.\" I thought they were only coated with polyethylene. I would much prefer a mattress or pad with a natural rubber core. The Naturepedic representative said the Naturepedic crib mattresses also contain this same polyethylene foam, although I'm not sure how much. I just do not feel comfortable putting my baby on their mattresses.
B0016RVLZY Thick, firm and organic - love it. I purchased this to replace the mattress in the Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper. It fits but could be about 1 inch longer. However, the mattress that the Sleeper comes with actually does not fit in tight to the ends, so I don't think that there is much difference. However, rolling up a prefold diaper and wedging it in to cover the 1-2 inch space (at baby's feet) actually makes it a really tight fit at the top and sides - tighter than the mattress it came with. I think it will be great for every night and during the day use. It's not ideal for traveling, as the sleeper won't close up as well so in those cases I will use the mattress it came with. I purchased Kushies organic bassinet sheet and it fits great after washing!
B0016RVLZY We bought the oval bassinet mattress to replace the plastic mattress that came with a cosleeper nest. It's fine, but there's not anything to it and the price is just ridiculous. We have the reversible crib/toddler mattress from the same company and that was something like $250. It's fantastic quality, so it seems ridiculous that this flimsy little mattress that is less than 1/20 the size of the crib mattress is almost $70.She didn't use this much because she wouldn't sleep apart from me very well, but we still had issues with the mattress dipping where she lay on it, even though she was teeny tiny (less than 6 pounds) when she used it.There aren't many options for organic bassinet mattresses, so for that reason alone (if you are like us and insist on organic bedding) it may be worth getting, but the price is still ridiculous.
B0016RVM4O I am so glad I purchased two of these crib pads.  I love that they are not fitted and it makes the crib easier to make.  I took another reviewers suggestion and  make the crib with a crib pad, sheet, crib pad and sheet.  This way if an accident occurs in the night, I can just pull off the top set.  It is also good to know that they are breathable and not vinyl.  They wash and dry well too.  I can see these passed along through a lot of babies when I am done with them.
B001708AS6 I ordered two valances and a matching tadpoles crib skirt... all three items were a different shade of pink. It would look terrible near each other so I had to return them. What a shame!
B00173DN6M perfectly fit to mini crib DaVinci. neutral color and very fun to have. good quality ))) I love it and hope to my baby will love it too
B00173DN6M This is very cute and very good quality!!  It fits our Port-a-crib perfectly!!  I bought a nice crib at a resale shop and ordered a new mattress, mattress cover and this set.  I wanted gender neutral so we can use if for years to come.  Very pleased with the product.
B00173DN6M Very Gender neutral great size for the mini crib and adorable on the mini crib I love it. Highly Recommend.
B00173DN6M It is a really cute set, nice design and neutral colors but unfortunately the sheet does not fit out mini crib mattress, it is too small. I can use it for pack and play but not regular crib. Wish I could use the whole set together.
B00173DN6M We got this for our son, and it's really adorable! We use it in our mini crib, and it's a perfect fit! The bumper doesn't stick-up a ton, so it's not as dangerous as some bumpers can be.
B00175ROGU KNOBBY TEXTURE CHEWY TUBE GREEN  very small, but baby likes to hold it, I usually give it while feed her
B00175ROGU My son has some chewing issues and this product helps him a lot. Instead of chewing on clothes and other items he grabs this. The size is great and he likes the color and texture.
B00175ROGU Always great to add to our chewy tube collection.  My daughter uses these a lot at therapy and sometimes I put her baby food on this to try to get her to eat.
B00175YU7G This has been my baby's very favorite teether. She absolutely loves it! We started using at about 2 1/2-3 months. It's soft and easy for her to hold. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ears are a bit long for a teether. My baby has gagged on them numerous times.
B00175YU7G I got this for some friends who are trying to be eco-friendly parents.  They were thrilled with this rattle/teether.  Their little one has really taken to it.  He got it at about 1 1/2 mo and loves chewing on it.  It's easy to wash and is shaped well for tiny hands.  They always bring it whenever they take the baby out somewhere.
B00175YU7G My son liked this teether a lot, especially as an older baby.  I like the soft knit over the firm body which gives more resistance when gnawing on it.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!
B00175YU7G We received one as a gift and tje little one played with it since newborn. Not sure how to wash it as it was heavily chewed on during teething episodes so we tossed it into the washer and dryer one day and had no problem. Since then, we had washed it monthly for a uear now and it retains its shape and color.Every time I go to a baby shower, I always include one as part of the gift!
B00175YU7G Cute natural toy.  I love that it is washable and made of natural materials.  It has a nice little rattle to it.
B00175YU7G This rattle is so cute. It took awhile for my child to get excited about it (9 months) but now it soothes her. I wash it in my washing machine without any problems.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a fun toy for my 6 month old, but he is not interested in it. It's durable and cute, but the rattle noise is extremely soft... not enough to hold my son's attention. And it is not something he is interested in teething on; although he's interested in teething on most everything else he can get his hands on. It's a nice toy, just not for us.
B00175YU7G Our baby irl has been teething since she was only 2 months old. She did not like the cold teethers but the hard ones she would bonk her head with so... we tried this one and she loves it! She is now 6 months old and we have to take the bear with us wherever we go!
B00175YU7G At first my son wasn't fond of this teether... he just never liked it. He puts EVERYTHING in his mouth but I give him the one thing I want him to put in his mouth and he refuses it! BUT, after a few months I tried it again and now it seems to work quite well. With teething it's important to have more than one type because baby gets bored with each relatively quickly.
B0017JB6HY I ended up going to buy one of these after my baby was born. My newborn needed to be swaddled to stay asleep for any length of time. Trying to swaddle with a blanket was too hard. This product has velcro to help keep it snug. I like that the bottom pouch can be undone for diaper changes. I don't think that the Sleep Sack brand swaddlers work any better, so the price difference is a huge factor in my recommending this product. I recently bought the larger size for my daughter now that she's grown out of the small.
B0017JB6HY These swaddles are great because they keep the child secure.  When my child got old enough to start rolling over, we stop swaddling the arms and just swaddle around the chest.  It becomes a routine to wrap them up and put them to bed.  My daughter actually smiles when I get the swaddle out, because she knows when it is time to go to sleep.
B0017JB6HY So many cute prints!  This is much easier to use than to try to swaddle with a regular receiving blanket.  Also can keep baby swaddled without undoing the entire thing.
B0017JB6HY I absolutely love this product! It's very soft and comfy and it keeps my baby nice and cozy.I love the fact that I do not have to un-swaddle her completely for the diaper change. Also it's very easy to use, even my husband can do it :-)))
B0017NC77I This is very handy and I would not buy a big stroller again.  We went to the Rec center and the elevator was broken so I shrugged my shoulders and pulled my kid out, folded it down, and swung it over my shoulder.  This is definitively a great little stroller and very light.  The only thing I miss is being able to have a small diaper bag hanging on the bar while I pill my kid out.  I know you are not supposed to do that!  This will fall over because the stroller is so light.
B0017NC77I Like many reviewers, I chose the G-Lite narrowly over the MacLaren Volo.  After 3 months of use, I like the stroller quite a 
B0017NC77I The stroller image shown for Jake is for the higher priced g-LUXE model, not g-LITE....this model does not recline, has smaller black wheels, and not fold up footrest for infants. This listing is incorrect, hopefully they will correct it soon to show the actual item you receive.
B0017NC77I I have an UppaBaby Vista for everyday and love it, so I got the G-Lite for shorter trips, mainly travel.  I love how light it is, and easy to carry with the carry-strap.  It's easy to fold and carry up and down stairs.  However, we've realized that we now need to buy another stroller for travel, because the G-Lite doesn't have recline.The 7 lb weight is simply amazing, but the stroller doesn't look cheap. It looks high-tech with its aluminum frame and bright colors.  The sunshade is great, really covering the baby.  And the fold, while two handed, is easy to do while holding the baby on my hip.  Also, thank you, Uppa, for adding a cupholder to this model.This stroller, however, sacrifices some features for its lightness.  You will not have a tray (not a problem for us), or any cushy strap-covers or pillows.  Also, for us, the big problem is that it doesn't recline.  We should have thought more about the G-Luxe, but we figured we'd use the Vista for day-long journeys.  Rather, when you travel and can't pack the Vista (or don't want to lug it in and out of the subway), the G-Luxe would have been a better choice.  Also, like all umbrella strollers, you shouldn't take your child out while the diaper bag is slung on the handles, as it will fall over.You see, we just took the G-Lite to NYC for the day.  It was great, with its kickstand, to fold up on the subway.  Slung over my shoulder, it was easy to carry up the narrow stairs at some of the stations.  We could fold it up at restaurants.  The underside basket is a little small but we were able to store a small bag down there.  However, the problem came in that my child could not nap in this stroller.  We had him all around Germany in a Teutonia, which reclines all the way like a bed, and he just took naps in it.  So we thought we'd have no problem on vacation in New York.  But with this stroller, he either lolled forward, or his head lay on the folding mechanism.  He slept very poorly and was in a terrible mood as a result.  We are now looking at other umbrella strollers with recline, like the Mac Quest and Uppa G-Luxe for our travel stroller.  Meanwhile, we will definitely keep the G-Lite in our trunks for quick mall jaunts.
B0017NC77I We love this stroller.  It is well worth the extra money.  It is light, attractive, has a bit of storage, and folds easily.  It has a great shoulder strap for carrying -- I carry it up and down 3 flights of stairs, daily, while I'm holding my one-year old and a diaper bag.  Unlike the UPPAbaby vista, which we also have, this one has a foot lock that is easy to work.  The harness is very easy to use.  My only complaint:  the cup holder broke off of mine.  But to be fair, I dropped the stroller on its side (without the baby in it!)  I highly recommend this stroller.
B0017NNSRQ This is a darling stuffed monkey and perfect for a young one if you take the ribbon off.  He is cute, soft and great for a young one because the face is stiched and painted on.  I bought it for my daughter who is decorating the babies room with a zoo theme.
B0017OAGHU I use this all the time for my mattress when a diaper leaks. It leaves my mattress smelling clean (a little strong-smelling, but I can live with that) and neutralizes the urine smell. No idea why it isn't carried in stores.
B0017P3LQW Great product - just what we needed for our daily walks in the city.  It fits the stroller great (we have a baby jogger mini and regular size too) and it keeps our 15 month old toddler nice and cozy.  It's machine washable, and adjustable so when we're ready we can lenghen it.  You can also zip open the hood and roll each side back, so it's nice to have that option.  We expect to use it for several winters.  Highly recommend this product.
B0017P3LQW worked great in my bugaboo chameleon, almost too warm, a little big for a newborn. like that it's grows with my child.
B0017P3LQW I walk a lot with my family and we would not be as active during the cold weather without this bunting. It has been invaluable to me and my little ones during the winter.  It is very warm; perfect for children who dislike layers. Prior to owning the Blanket 212 I used aJJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Stealth, Infant. When my child outgrew the JJ Cole bunting I knew I needed something more substantial, I found this and I am glad I purchased it. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:- Very warm.- Doesn't slide down the seat when getting my child in and out.- Adjustable length and width- Looks great- Useful front pocket- Washable- Easily converts from toddler to baby sizeThe B212 has served us well for one child through 2 winters but now that I have a second baby I wanted to use this again and I have run into a few problems.Cons:- Not very durable. The bunting has begun to unravel at the seams of the hood and where the harness straps thread through the body of the bunting.- Hood isn't removable. This is important to me because my baby gets very hot while sleeping and sweats a lot from her head and neck.- Doesn't fit all of the strollers I own. Fits the City Mini and Mountain Buggy Urban but does not fit the UPPAbaby Vista or Cosatto umbrella strollers well.- When shortened to accommodate a baby the bottom is drafty.I still believe this item deserves 4 stars and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again. I used this with my first child from 18 months to 3 years and sparingly for my now 7 month old. I did contact 7A.M customer service about the seams unraveling and while they were unable to repair or replace the bunting the response was fairly quick and very cordial.
B0017S2S86 I've been using this mattress for six months and it's great.  There are no dents or impressions in it.  I am looking forward to being able to still use this when she is a toddler.
B0017S2S86 Really like this crib Mattress. Especially the 2 sidesInfant & toddler sides with different firmness.Got 1st mattress as a gift for daughter #1 & bought second one for baby#2!
B0017S2S86 We purchased this mattress for our Davinci Kalani crib.  It is a perfect tight fit in the crib.  The mattress seems firm and sturdy.  We have not used the mattress yet due to our daughter not being due for a few months.  I am happy with the purchase so far.  We will see how our daughter likes it when she is born...
B0017S2S86 This mattress was purchased for my grandson to be and fit my daughter's Lauren crib perfectly.  Delivery was quick but since baby is due any day we won't know much more until he arrives!
B0013OX9NC Lutein is vitamin good for the eyes, this Jarrow vitaimin is extracted from marigold pedals, laong w/ soybean oil, beeswax and  mixed tocopherols.The softgel consists of  gelatin, glycerinm, nad waterThe recommended dosage is one soft gel per day.
B0013OX9NC I started taking \"eye vitamins\" when my mother's sight began fading due to age-related macular degeneration (abbreviated AREDS).  The key ingredient I look for is lutein.  Unfortunately, the typical eye vitamin is sized like a horse pill, and I have trouble swallowing big pills.  These are not only sized smaller, they are softgels, which means they go down easy!  I am glad I found these.
B0013OX9NC I intend to enjoy active health and my physical senses well into my later years. So I take a lot of supplements (with my doctor's okay), in recommended dosages. Lutein is one for the eyeballs. It is purported to protect vision in the macula and lens.Recommended daily amount is one softgel per day with food. The source for this pill is marigold petals, and there is 20 mg of lutein per serving. There is also Vitamin E as an oil-based carrier, which is nice.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended lutein years ago when I developed a macular problem. Although I have never taken the Jarrow lutein, I have taken others as a supplement. I find theJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsto be an easy to swallow capsule with no aftertaste and it is available at a reasonable price. I will continue to purchase. The only negative for me is the gelatin capsule, but I'm willing to swallow that minor complaint for the benefits.
B0013OX9NC This is a high quality Lutein supplement for a company I trust. I would highly recommend it for anyone who takes Lutein.
B0013OX9NC These soft gel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I experience no undesirable flavor when consuming the pill.The capsules consist of marigold petal extract; each tablet provides 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin. The other ingredients consist of soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols. The gel capsule is made from gelatin, glycerin and water.I am unable to determine whether or not my eye health has improved, but if these extracts contribute to macular protection and visual function, as the product claims, this supplement is a welcome addition to my diet.
B0013OX9NC I have never had good eyesight, and I have noticed increasing problems as I've aged. I'm concerned enough to take this supplement. Like beta-carotene, lutein (in the form of Marigold petal extract) helps counteract the effects of aging on vision. Furthermore, lutein is an antioxidant and aids in cell growth and repair.One capsule a day makes it possible to get the necessary amount of lutein. The capsules are easy to take and have no aftertaste.
B0013OX9NC I use Lutein for my vision.  It seems to help w
B0013OX9NC The softgel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I have been taking them for over a month now with no adverse effect. Occasionally the fillers in supplements can cause me to experience stomach irritation; no problem with the Jarrows Formula. Another plus, they are reasonably priced and delivered to your door.I have not see any change in my vision, but I was not having any problems to begin with. On the advice of my physician, I have started taking Lutein along with Vitamin A to help prevent the development of macular degeneration. My mom suffers from this disease and it is known to run in families.
B0013OX9NC It's easy to swallow.  I cannot tell if it has helped my vision or any of the other physical enhancements the makers say it might do.  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years for various things, but as I can recall, I've never noticed any improvement or extra anything.  But, if doctors are telling their patients to take a Lutein supplement to help macular degeneration or other disorder, then I suspect it will help.
B0013OX9NC I'm getting older, so this seems like a good supplement to help my rapidly declining eyesight.  I like Jarrow products in general, the bottles are not impossible to open, and the capsules and soft gels always arrive intact.  These are easy to swallow, cause no indigestion or other stomach problems, and although I can't say for sure they are improving my eyesight, I feel confident that this antioxidant is  good for my health in general.
B0013OX9NC If one is going to use this combination of supplements to enhance \"eye health\", with the concurrence of an eye care professional, this is an easy product to implement into one's regimen.  They are not too large--the size of typical vitamin E caplets, and covered with the same plasticky coating.  I personally have no problem swallowing them, since they are about one half the size of the usual fish oil 1000 mg. bubble.  While they do cling to the plastic compartment of my pill dish, they do not adhere to the other pills in the dish, nor leak.  I have noticed no aftertaste, and have no idea if they are going to enhance
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow brand, if you are unfamiliar, is well respected in the natural food community. e.g., it's sold at my local organic food co-op. These lutein and zeaxanthin antioxidants may be of particular interest if you are concerned about macular degeneration, and the like.Luteins are no joke. Macular carotenoid researchers are actively exploring up-to-date and evidence-based hypotheses and the supporting research data into the role of the macular carotenoids in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), vision, and cognitive function. You can search on the web for macular carotenoids.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking lutein/zeaxanthin supplements for many years.  These are less expensive than many of the other brands, and seem to work just as well.  I will use this brand again, and will also look at the rest of their product line.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I take lutein for my eyesight. As I grow older my eyesight gets progressively worse. Lutein is meant to support good cell growth and slow the effects of aging on the eyes.  I hope it works but just using it for a short time so far it's impossible to tell. I can say that the pill is small and easy to swallow and I've had no side effects.
B0013OX9NC Macular Degeneration runs in my family so my doctor recommended that I take Lutein supplements to try to avoid the same issues.  These are very easy to take with no bad odors or unpleasant aftertaste.  They are not too big to swallow and do not cause any side effects.  I have found Jarrow to be a reputable manufacturer of supplements and their prices are usually quite fair.  Quality is consistent and superior to many higher cost brands.
B0013OX9NC I've used the Jarrow Vision Optimizer that boasts more ingredients:- Vitamin C, E, niacinamide, B1, B2, B6, Selenium, Taurine, Quercetin, Blackcurrant Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Gamma Tocopherol, Grape Seed Extract, Eyebright, Ginkgo Biloba, Lutein, Zeaxanthin.It might appear that the Vision Optimizer is better than this one (the Lutein and Zeaxanthin), but oh, there's something to consider before letting judgement fall.  The Vision Optimizer capsules are big and harder to swallow, and the serving size is 3 of the capsules per day!Also, the Vision Optimizer has only 10mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin.This Jarrow Formula, has 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin and the capsules are much easier to swallow and the service size is only one.So, if you need more Lutein, this is the one. If you don't like large capsules, this is the one.If you want a more comprehensive protocol, the vision optimizer has a wider range of ingredients that are believed to help the eyes in many ways.
B0013OX9NC This Lutein supplement is a great addition to a healthy diet: taken once a day with water, this is helpful for improvements in skin, eyes, and other tissues...decent price, good product, would recommend!
B0013OX9NC When I take this Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  I can see better and my vision got clear.  When I forgot to take it one day or two...my vision get blurry....Then I took it and got clear in few hours.  I guess Lutein is very essential for our retina.
B0013OX9NC It is a small palatable pill and rather easy to take.  As for whether it is useful for my eyes, I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working.  I doubt that the effect could be felt in a short period of time. I will give this a try and see if I can see better.
B0013OX9NC My eye guy recommended that I take Lutein, and use a supplement that has at lease 10 mg of Lutein. This has twice that, plus you get 60 softgels. Plus it's under $10, so it's less expensive and has twice the active ingredient than other brands. It's also a small softgel, so is easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC My relatives have serious vision issues as they age including glaucoma & macular degeneration. My own eye exams include the higher $ retinal imaging record as a preventative detection measure. Since lutein has been in my regimen for yours, the retinal images have been unchanged for the good or diagnosed as better.Improved absorption of lutein through more current technology is all good.
B0013OX9NC I did my homework when I decided on adding a Lutein supplement. I've been taking Jarrow's Lutein formula for over a year now. And I can tell that it helps my eyes because they get worse when I forget to take it! I trust this brand for purity - something you have to check out with vitamin companies.Important: The softgel has a great shape that goes down easy with no aftertaste.Take it and be healthy!
B0013OX9NC i take lutein for eye health- jarrow is a good brand that i trust.  this lutein was at a good price and i believe it is a quality product.
B0013OX9NC Lutein has numerous benefits for your vision. These softgels are the best around in price per mg and a way better bargain that what you will find in Wal-Mart or drug stores. If you're in the market for lutein this is a good option.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit, I prefer Jarrow products over other brands. They're of excellent quality at a reasonable price, making them one of the best values in nutritional supplements around. The 20mg Lutein softgels are easy to swallow and don't have any odd odors or lingering flavors. They're easy to take and don't upset my somewhat sensitive stomach, even if taken on an empty stomach. If you're looking for a Lutein supplement to help keep your eyes healthy, Jarrow Formulas comes highly recommended.
B0013OX9NC I like the convenience and price of having these Lutein auto-shipped every other month. I take one daily for eye health but found remembering to get them and finding a reasonably price 20mg formula a hassle. Very happy with having them automatically show up every sixty days and getting a discounted price is great.
B0013OX9NC The product is excellent for eye health. Lutein and Zexanthin is great for promoting eye health. So, this is a good source for those two important vitamins.But, I wished I had read the ingredients list closer, because this product DOES contain soy. If you have a sensitivity to soy, like I do, then you'll want to avoid this product.
B0013OX9NC After having a bad experience with the new age fad of sungazing, I found lutein to be effective in getting my vision back to normal. Beforehand, I was starting to have trouble reading bookprint of whatever size for any length of time. Thanks to lutein, my vision has improved so it is not blurry anymore. Jarrow makes a quality form of lutein.
B0013OX9NC I've started taking eye vitamins, even though I'm not sure if they are truly beneficial or not.  I am assuming they are, and these Jarrow ones are very easy to swallow and are nicely priced.  Eye vitamins in the grocery store and drug store cost a lot more.  In fact, they are some of the most expensive vitamins out there!
B0013OX9NC My husband and I have been taking Jarrow's Lutein for the last several weeks.  These softgels contain 20 mgs of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  The floaters my husbands has in his eyes seem to be getting better.  In terms of protecting the macula I assume this is a product that needs to be taken long term to prevent macular degeneration as an older adult.  The cost if used daily  (as sold by Amazon) is $.15 per pill.  Bausch and Lomb advertises a Lutein/Zexanthin/Omega-3 version of Occuvite on television though I have not yet been able to find that triple supplement combination online.  This product is easy to swallow and has no aftertaste or other ill effects at least in our family.
B0013OX9NC Lutein (and Zeaxanthin) are medically known and with much evidence shown to reduce the risk of AMD (Age-related Muscular Degeneration) and cataract.Due to this reason, I have been keeping my daily intake of vegetables (with Lutein) at about 10-20 mg per day. This has also been a recommended intake for both eye and health benefits as Lutein is a powerful anti-oxidant.However, when we travel, vegetables tend to be a neglected dish and we are glad that with the Jarrow Formulas Lutein softgels, we are able to supplement it to our diet.The pill is medium-sized, has a slight odor and is easy to swallow. One pill carries 20mg Lutein and 1mg Zeaxanthin. A good product to bring during travels or as regular intake to supplement a high protein/low veggie diet.
B0013OX9NC For the last year and a half, I've been concentrating on doing everything I can to prevent my eyesight from deteriorating further. Lutein with Zeaxanthin is one of the basic components of my plan. Although I also take other products, I alternate the rest from day to day. Lutein is the only one I take everyday and I credit the majority of my improvement to this product.The Jarrow formula has the same proportion of the two ingredients that is found in nature when everything is working right. It is a small, easy to swallow capsule, no smell, no aftertaste, and it works. It is also safe, no side effects at even more than this concentration, and no drug interactions.I am obviously doing something right. In the 18-month period, I've had three sets of eyeglasses: the ones I had before I had to start taking prednisone every day. My eyesight was noticeably affected pretty soon after starting and the eyeglass prescription that had been almost unchanged for years became almost useless. I had to get new ones made that were a much stronger prescription. After my latest checkup, those were too strong, and I am almost (not quite, but close) to my old prescription.In addition to this Lutein/Zeaxanthin product, I also take bilberry, choline (a B vitamin) and, twice a week, beta carotene and the AREDS formula. (Note: the last two I take with restraint because both vitamins A & E can have side effects in excess and I'm uncomfortable taking 500% or more of something on a daily basis).My eyesight has, not only not deteriorated further, which was what I'd hoped for, it is almost back to where it was before. I am very happy and relieved, and I am going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with macular degeneration several years ago. I immediately started taking lutein (from various providers) and it seems to me there's been no significant deterioration in my eyesight, which leads me to believe it is beneficial. Of course, this is all so subjective. There's absolutely no way for me to know this definitively.The Jarrow Lutein compares favorably with other brands I've taken, and the price is comparable to what I usually purchase from Sam's Club or Costco.
B0013OX9NC The softgels, to me, are easy to swallow.  This product contains 20 mg of Lutein, which is more than some of the other brands, but also less than some.  Be sure to read the labels before making your purchase to find out the desired milligrams vs. price.
B0013OX9NC We tried the Jarrow Lutein 20mg, and there it is a fine quality product. Jarrow is known for its quality ingredients. The reason we aren't giving this 5 stars is that the increased dosage doesn't seem worth it. We normally take a lower dose (and therefore less expensive) and there is no noticeable difference in taking these. So I'd be hard pressed to say: \"spend extra for the higher dose\". But if you are new to Lutein, and can find these at a good price, by all means use them.
B0013OX9NC I have used several and still use Jarrow products. I seem to have had an allergic reaction to the Jarrow Formulas Lutein. This product is made from Marigold petals. My reaction was tightness in the lungs, small hives on my neck and swollen and sore joints in my hands after taking the recommended dosage for 4 days. I am not going to be too quick to blame this product, but every indication leads me to the Lutein. It could have been coincidence, some other external cause or this product. I take several vitamins, minerals and other food supplements including some from Jarrow. I have never had a problem with them and have taken them for from 3 months to several years. All things seemed to be the same except the addition of Lutein. I stopped taking the Lutein after 4 days, and 2 days later all symptoms were gone. Since everyone has different reactions to the same foods, etc. each must judge for oneself.
B0013OX9NC After my left retina detached I learned about vitamins that promote good eye health. Lutein is perhaps the most important. We have used Jarrow before for other supplements and trust the brand. I am hoping to prevent a future detachment by taking lutein daily.
B0013OX9NC Approaching age 60, and suffering from common deteriorating eye performance, this supplement is right up my alley.  After a little over a week, I think I am already seeing some improvement in reading performance and night vision.  The long term benefit is pretty widely accepted on this stuff.The lutein in the Jarrow Formulas supplement is extracted from marigold petals, and purportedly supplements the body as an antioxidant, acting in much the same manner as spinach (an excellent vegetable choice).  Lutein specifically combats aging and degeneration of the macula (delicate light/color sensing area in the rear wall of the eye).  As a general tissue health enhancer, lutein is also believed to enhance cardio and skin health and complex tissues such as cervical and breast tissue.Each medium size and easy to swallow Jarrow's softgel contains 20mg lutein.  Recommended dosage, one per day.Contains no gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish.  Interestingly . . . I have gotten used to always seeing a boilerplate warning on Jarrow Formulas supplements containers warning pregnant women, people under medication, etc.  However, there is no warning of any kind on this container.Jarrow has an excellent reputation.  Lutein has widely recognized benefit and this deserves to be a key item on my vitamin shelf.
B0013OX9NC I have tried to rotate a lot of these Jarrow products, because my kitchen drawer looks like a drugstore.  I have just begun taking these and I haven't seen a difference in my vision. My eyes are ok in the morning and I only use glasses for driving and at night when my eyes are tried and can't focus.  We will see if these pills help me as I take them.
B0013OX9NC This formula has excellent amount of Lutein, 20mg, and price is very good, about 1/2 the price for same formula of 'brand name' in CVS.  Please take with food as softgels are fat-soluble.  I already take a lot of different vitamins a day, and was glad this addition is just one small softgel.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg are an excellent source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. As we age, our eyesight diminishes and isn't what it used to be. The combination of ingredients in this product are formulated to help improve and sustain the eyesight and eye health as we age.Knowing what I've witnessed many relatives go through all sorts of diminished vision and other eye problems as they aged, I'm determined to do what I can to avoid as many of the same problems as best as I can.I want to live as long as possible and have the eyesight to enjoy watching it all happen around me!
B0013OX9NC After reading so much about Lutein and its Properties I decided to get \"Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels\" Lutein Supplements are use to Treat or Prevent Eye Diseases, such as Cataracts and Macular Degeneration known to be build up in the Retina and Lens of the Eye, Lutein is thought to Protect the Eye from Injury induced by Free Radicals. Even though I only been taking it for just a month I know I can see everything a little Brighter...Really! I was Amazed how Bright and Crisp Clear I can see everything, you get results within 3 Weeks, to the Point that I got Lutein Capsules for my Entire Family. I was surprised by the Size of the Softgels, they are a little Big for my Taste, but easy to Swallow. To increase your Lutein intake without the use of Lutein Supplements, include Lutein-Rich Foods like Kale, Spinach, Cabbage, Green Beans, Mangoes, and Papayas in your daily Diet. I like taking Lutein which is part of my daily routine intake Recommended!... Thank You D.D.
B0013OX9NC In today's world, bombarded as we are with UV, pollution and etc, not to mention living longer, eye health is important. Lutein has been shown to be a effective tool for vision health. Jarrow is one of the most respected brands in the business. This is also a pretty good price and easy to take, with no nasty \"vitamin burps' afterwards.\"Looks like\" you'll want to get some, then.
B0013OX9NC This little softgel is about the size of a navy bean and it smooth and easy to swallow. The inside ingredients contain marigold petal extracts, Lutein and Zeaxanthin. The softgel shell is made of gelatin, glycerin and water. Even though there is no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg , fish/shellfish or peanuts/tree nuts, this is not a vegan product because of the gelatin. It is said to be good for the Macula of the eye and to support visual function. I hope it works, as I had a hard time reading the micro small print on the label. Take one a day with food.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is inferior to Jarrow Formulas Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase, which additionally to nattokinase contains also red yeast rice beneficial for lowering cholesterol, if with monacolin K.  Nattokinase has only a potential to thin blood, but the effective dosage is unknown.  Thus, nattokinase with unknown effectiveness is inferior to plain aspirin with known blood thining effectiveness.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soy (natto), which is great for clearing blood clots and reducing blood pressure. It normally comes with vitamin K, another blood thinning compound, so Jarrow provides this option of getting the enzyme without vitamin K in case you are already on blood thinning medications. This supplement is safe when used as directed and it is one that is effective for what people usually use it for. Jarrow provides high quality at a reasonable cost. This is certainly an item that can help with specific health concerns.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is a supplement that is vegetarian friendly.  Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been used for almost a thousand years.  I have been using the, for almost a month and I'm enjoying the results.  If you're looking to add some natto into your diet then I would start with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax.  Especially for vegans who are looking for a healthy supplement.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract derived from fermented soy in each vegetarian capsule.  It contains nattokinase, a proteolytic enzyme produced by the prokaryotic organism Bacillus subtilis during the fermentation process.The safety-sealed bottle that I received has an expiration date of 09/15, about eighteen months from receipt.All of the supplements that I have tried from Jarrow Formulas seem to be of good quality, and this one is no exception.
B0013OX9XW I have been eating Natto my whole life. Natto supports both blood clotting and clot dissolving. This NattoMax has the Vitamin K2 removed and only the Nattokinase remaining. This then is suppose to help the body's own fibrin dissolving mechanisms. I like the function of this supplement and would much rather take it than a patented prescription pill.The freshness and quality of the Jarrow formula seems to be potent and active. I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas and consider them a leading manufacturer.
B0013OX9XW I know the great health benefits of eating natto and have been eating it as often as my wife allows me, since she doesn&#8217;t like the smell.  Now I can get the same benefit by taking this pill without annoying my wife.
B0013OX9XW Where to begin? Well, go read the description and decide from there. This supplement seems to provide quite a number of health benefits all rolled into one convenient product. Like all Jarrow Formulas products, this one is consistent and appears to be of excellent quality. There is little odor, no unpleasant or lingering taste, and it is very easy to swallow. Unlike most Jarrow products, this one causes mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach, so I'd advise to always take these with some food if you have a sensitive stomach.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow is so very reliable with their supplements.  The quality and reliability is always there.  This is a very good Natto supplement.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is the non-nasty way to consume the health benefits of natto. I apologize if I insult anyone's taste for natto.I cannot tell the affects it has had internally, but I feel about the same. I still think it is worth taking because of the health-related claims of natto.If I could figure out one more way to use natto in a sentence...
B0013OX9XW This product helped the person I asked to sample this item by preventing blood clots.  It seems a more delicate solution than other medications on the market.
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements because the anti-oxidant power of pomegranates are said to have anti-aging benefits as well as aiding skin cell regeneration. These vitamins are easy to take, have no taste and are less expensive than the juice. I believe that my skin has benefitted from taking these in addition to DHA supplements and will continue to take them everyday.
B0013OXA5Y I used to drink POMWonderful juice daily. Then I realized that PomWonderful, while claiming to have a lot of antioxidants, also has an exorbitant amount of sugar (something like 28 g in one serving).The benefits of pomegranate are desirable for antioxidants as well as cardiofunction, so these vitamins come in handy. I take them as a vitamin C supplement.;, i.e., instead of taking vitamin C.The pill itself is about medium size but easy to swallow. I prefer wrapping it in food and literally taking it \"with food\" for easier swallowing and digestion.The pills are great, but as with any vitamins, try to get as much of the real thing as you can, and only tak the vitamins when the real fruit is unavailable (not in season / you are on the road).These are vegan/vegetarian safe, if you are worried about allergens.
B0013OXA5Y I gave this five stars because I love jarrow Formulas and it is one of three top brands of supplements I usually buy. I am a supplement freak and easily take at least 15 different ones a day. I can't say that I know for sure any of them do anything except for Methyl B12 which I can feel, vitamin C, fiber, and D3. This one, with pomguard, Jarrow's proprietary brand of pomegranite, is one that I just have to use on faith.I am sure you know the hype about pomegranite so I won't rehash it here except to say that it had it's day a few years back as the antioxidant du jour. I, like many others, bought and drank POM, pomegranite juice, for a while until I realized that it didn't seem to do much except add calories to my diet.These little pills go down easily, and I like knowing that just in case they really do help prevent aging and illness, I am being protected by them. Whether you feel the need to add pomegranite antioxidants to your daily regimen is up to you, but if you do, you can't beat Jarrow Formulas as a trusted brand.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes have become quite the rage.  Touted for their antioxidant benefits, the fruit and their juice have become prohibitively expensive. Moreover it is challenging to extract the seeds.This supplement contains 100% pomegrante extract making it easy and affordable to enjoy the advantages without the mess and expense. The pills are easy to swallow and I noticed no side effects.  As with most supplements of this type, they are prophylactic and their benefits are hard to guage.My experience with Jarrow has been positive. Their supplments are high quality and their customer service people are responsive. If you are looking to incorporate the goodness of pomegrante into your diet, this is an easy way to do so.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard by Jarrow Formulas is a decent supplement.  It consists of capsules containing pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid.  Other IngredientsThe only other ingredient is silcon dioxide. The capsule is made from hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.As with other Jarrow Formula products, PomGuard contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts.Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract and there are  60 capsules in the bottle.Pomegranate is an antioxidant, and is believed to support cardiovascular and arterial functions.  Of course, as an antioxidant, it can reduce free radical damage.Jarrow Formulas' recommended dose is 1 to 2 capsules per day.  The extract contains the whole fruit, that is peel, membrane, juice and seed.NOTE: Although the active ingredient in the capsules is pomegranate fruit extract, please keep in mind this looks and smells like pretty much any other gelatin capsule product.  If you are expecting something chewable, sweet, etc. this IS NOT it.The capsules are average size and not difficult to swallow.This is a good supplement if you like to take antioxidants and/or are a believer in some of the benefits attributed to pomegranate.
B0013OXA5Y I've taken various antioxidant type supplements over the past year or so and I switch between brands once in awhile to see which is more effective. As far as the Jarrow brand I've been using their supplements for a couple of years now.I like to work-out a lot and to prevent free-radical damage I take some type of anti-oxidant supplement right after my workouts. I've been taking this for a couple of weeks now and have not experienced any side-effects. Good supplement with high-quality ingredients.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice is awfully expensive nowadays, and this supplement contains derivatives of pomegranate that are just as beneficial as the juice.  Pomegranate supports a healthy cholesterol level, acts as a powerful antioxidant in our bodies, maintains a healthy blood platelet level, helps with high blood pressure, stimulates collagen synthesis (great for skin!), and more.  Jarrow has done it again.  I have lots of their formulations and consider Jarrow to be my favorite brand for supplements.  Always high quality.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are renowned for their anti-oxidant abilities but who enjoys eating a pomegranate?  They are tart and filled with seeds and are more trouble than they are worth.  Pomegranate juice is very expensive.  These tablets therefore are easy to swallow, lack that tart aftertaste, and still provide the benefits of the pomegranate.I take one in the morning after my coffee.  While I can not profess a long life or newborn physical abilities, I know I am taking in the benefits of the pomegranate daily.
B0013OXA5Y These are fairly large capsules filled with 100% powdered pomegranate extract. The powder is a purple-brown and has a pleasant scent and no discernible flavor when swallowing. I am taking one of these daily along with Jarrow Formulas Quercetin. I hope both together make a potent antioxidant combination.
B0013OXA5Y For those of us who see improved health with supplements, having to take three or six capsules a day, particularly in divided doses, is a real pain.  Thus I am delighted to be able to get what should be a therapeutic dosage in a single daily capsule.  Kudos to Jarrow.I am taking this supplement to lower bad cholesterol.  My doctor wants to put me on cholesterol-lowering medicine and I am resisting.  So I started taking this supplement two weeks ago with no side effects. I don't like the flavor of pomegranate juice so this is a better way for me to get it into my system.My annual physical is several months away and I will continue the supplement until then.  In the absence of a blood test, I have no way of knowing if it is useful.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because i heard great things about it. And i was getting tired of my acai juices. So this is nice to get teh benefits with an easy to swallow pill.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard is a pomegranate extract and the health benefits of pomegranates are wonderful. The PomGuard pill itself is a medium sized extract filled capsule. It's ok to take. I have a little trouble with the capsules going down as smooth as a regular tablet but it's not that bothersome.I didn't have any side effects or upset stomach with it.
B0013OXA5Y My husband uses this and we trust the Jarrow name. I don't like to buy brands i have never heard of just because they are cheaper.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are already well established for their healthy benefits: A powerful antioxidant, heart health, nourishes skin, and is supposed to be a great inhibitor of women troubles (PMS, menopause issues, ITUs, etc.)Jarrow formulas is a very affordable and easily absorbed product as Pom-products can be rather pricey, Jarrow gets my vote for reliable products that are easily digestible and affordable.
B0013OXA5Y Well packaged, fresh, and intact pills. Good way to sup without getting the sugar found in the juice, which is also expensive. The real fruit is not bad, but is messy. So having something in extract form is nice and Jarrow is a company I trust. No side effects for this product for me. 425mg of extract per pill.
B0013OXA5Y I have been switching back and forth between blueberry and black raspberry antioxidant supplements.  It was nice to switch things up by trying PomGuard.Jarrow is one of my favorite supplement manufacturers.  I trust the products and search for their brands first when looking for a specific supplement.I not experienced any bad side effects to these supplements.  No stomach upset and that is my biggest issue.  I finished the bottle and all was well.Current price point is excellent.  If you are in the market for an anti-oxidant or a supplement for cardiovascular health, I would give Jarrow's PomGuard a try.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow makes some excellent products, and is thoughtful in creating products like this that provide all the benefits of pure ingredients, and suitable for vegetarians and those with specific allergies. According to the label it contains no wheat, no gluten, so soybeans, no egg, no dairy, no fish/shellfish and no peanuts/tree nuts. It costs a bit more than some bargain brands, but you don't have to worry about additives or ingredients (like gelatin capsules) made from animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I really like Jarrow Formula's products, and PomGuard is one of the good ones. Pomegranate has many health benefits, many of the same benefits you get from the ever-popular Acai. It is full of antioxidants, which helps eliminate free radicals from the body. It is also supposed to support cardiovascular function, which I really need right now. The capsules aren't hard to swallow, and you only have to take one once or twice a day. It never hurts to start taking something that's good for your health!
B0013OXA5Y Love this great Jarrow supplement that provides antioxidents and heart healthy formula. Everyone loves the great healing properties of Pomegranate, but some may not like the taste of the juice. While some of the juices are not all pomegranate and the cost can be prohibitive too. Here is a reasonably priced solution. Pomegranate in an easy to swallow capsule.
B0013OXA5Y This dietary suppliment from Jarrow is a nice source of antioxidents.Each bottle contains 60 capsules.Contains 100% California Pomegranate fruit extract.
B0013OXA5Y With a family medical history that includes Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, I've been taking antioxidants for several years, including pomegranate extracts, juices, and teas. I've taken other Jarrow products, so I had no problem with changing to Jarrow Pomgard capsules. Most of the other pomegranate supplements that I've tried weren't always clear on what parts of the fruit were used, but Jarrow's formula includes the whole fruit extract - juice, peel, seed, and membrane. That's the only way to know that you're getting all the benefits of the pomegranate.I've done a lot of personal research into the alleged benefits of taking pomegranate supplements, and it's an impressive list. If only a few of the claimed benefits are realized, then it's well worth taking.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate has so many health benefits but unfortunately I really don't like the taste of the juice. Also, a lot of fruit juices have a lot of sugar which I try to avoid. Therefore a capsule such as this one--100% pomegranate extract and nothing else--is a great thing for me. Both my husband and I take this capsule for it's antioxidant properties and to help improve cardiovascular function.This capsule isn't too big in size and doesn't have a funny taste when you swallow it. You only have to take one or two a day which isn't bad at all. I also try to take a flaxseed capsule for cardiovascular health but that capsule is so much bigger in size and is actually rather difficult to swallow. I'm not great at taking pills so i'm glad that this PomGuard capsule isn't overly large.I'm very happy with this product.
B0013OXA5Y I usually pick up some pomegranate juice once in a while for its health benefits (and i like the taste), but it is so expensive.  These tablets contain 425mg of pomegranate extract and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a definite believer in adding antioxidants to your diet. I also like facial products with antioxidants. I drink teas with antioxidants. I try to eat a \"rainbow\" of foods, and include various forms of nutritional antioxidants daily.I know I don't eat enough fruit, and I don't have the patience to eat actual pomegranites. So this is kind of a treat for my body.On the days I know I'm going to eat poorly - as on holidays, when traveling, or if I'm just super busy - then I make sure to grab antioxidant supplements.Pomegranite is one of the top \"faddish\" antioxidants, but some research shows it's a good one, up there with blueberries, acai, red wine, green tea, and vitamins A and C.The bottle recommends taking these after - not during - a meal.The pills come in a clear cellulose form of capsule, containing a reddish chunky powder. The bottle smells vaguely of fruit when you sniff the inside.The pills are 3/4s of an inch and are easy to swallow.There are sixty pills in a bottle and the serving size is one pill. As a two- month supply, this is a pretty good deal. I can stretch this out a bit by changing around which antioxidant pills I take that day. I try to mix it up with other antioxidants supplements, and if I have a big fruit day, I leave it at that.Recommended as part of an array of antioxidant sources. Nice quality pills.
B0013OXA5Y When I operated natural food stores and pomegranates were in season, I'd drink the juice of one every day by squeezing it all around, pricking it with my produce knife (used to butt heads of lettuce, etc.), and sucking the juice out. More recently when I learned about the antioxidant properties of pomegranates, I tried some juices that contained pomegranate juice, but I was never that impressed with the flavor nor with the amount of pomegranate said on labels to be actually in each serving. Jarrow Pomguard allows one to get the benefits of pomegranate by simply taking a daily capsule.WebMD has an informative article on the uses, side effects and interactions of pomegranate. Those considering taking a pomegranate supplement such as Jarrow PomGuard who also take prescription medications may want to check out the section on interactions at WebMD (e.g., pomegranate can lower blood pressure so someone taking any kind of medication that can also decrease blood pressure should be aware of this, plus one should know that pomegranate can \"decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications\").Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OXA5Y I take several supplements recommended by doctor and nutritionist, and although Pomguard is not one on their list, from what I have read and researched, it is good for the body in many ways.  I don't drink pomegranate juice because the sugar content is too high, so I am putting my confidence in these tablets.  .  I have tried several Jarrow products from the amazon Vine Program and they appear to be a reputable company with few additions to their products.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice made from the fruit and rind has a higher level of antioxidants than juice made without the rind.  Since PomGuard includes the rind, hopefully this increases it's antioxidant levels as well.  According to Jarrow, \"PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule.\", so if you want the benefit of all the parts of the pomegranate in a pill, this appears to be the only option.  Jarrow also says that PomGuard has \"NO synthetic ellagic acid.\"Although I prefer to eat the fruit, by taking a PomGuard pill most days, I can eat other fruits as well, without overdoing the sugar that fruits contain (I'm a low-carb person). Since I don't eat the peel when I eat the fruit, PomGuard offers an advantage here too.
B0013OXA5Y My husband is the type of person to always worry about his heart so he eats a lot of things that promote heart health, including pomegranates. But they're very expensive so instead he started taking PomGuard and he's impressed. He says they don't have a funny aftertaste and they're just like eating a pomegranate every day for your heart.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are so full of vitamins and so healthy for you - but dang, they're expensive to buy and hard to eat!  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard has all the benefits of eating pomegranates all packed into one little pill.  The pill is not large, easy to swallow, and delivers quite a healthy punch of vitamins and antioxidants.  While I can't give numbers on how effective they are in my system, I can say that I eat them and feel great.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y It has been proven to have cardiovascular protective effects. It is good to drink the pure pomegranate juice but that gets quite expensive. These are easy to swallow capsules that have not caused me any side effects. Like all supplements you should check with your health care provider before adding anything new. You can take 1 to 2 a day after meals. I take one as I take quite a few Jarrow supplements as I trust the quality.
B0013OXA5Y I've always heard about pomegranates being good for you due to their red color and antioxidant properties.  However, I've never bought them and really don't like the idea of dealing with all the seeds.  This supplement gives you all the health benefits of poms in a little pill.  Perfect.  I trust Jarrow for many of my vitamins and supplements, so the brand was a go for me.  I've been taking it daily, and, whereas I know I can't tell a difference, I feel like I've got some daily insurance that I'm doing something for my health and trying to offset free radical damage.  Of course, a pill like this won't give you the fiber and moisture that you get from fruits and veggies, so I eat lots of them daily.  But I will continue taking this insurance on a daily basis.
B0013OXA5Y I enjoy pomegranate juice, but it's expensive. I'm a big fan of most Jarrow products, and I'm glad they have this product because I can get a large dose of pomegranate in my diet.This is excellent if you're looking for anti-aging products. It's also good for coronary health.
B0013OXA5Y These tablets are reasonable size and go down easy. Loaded with the concentrate of the most healthy fruit on the planet. Pom is great tasting fruit but is not avaialble all year round, hence I low PomGuard as I have it available all year round for good health and prevention.
B0013OXA5Y I've happily found that Jarrow supplements tend to both work well and be well tolerated by my body.  I do feel a mild boost in immunity when taking pomegranate.  (Although, I'd rather just skip these pills and eat the yummy fruit or drink the yummy juice.)These are NOT marketed or intended as contraceptives (and I am in no way qualified to recommend them as such!), however it is said that in ancient times pomegranate seeds were used as contraceptives and abortofacients.  Two very good reasons to avoid these during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, please take extra care in speaking with your doctor about any supplements you are considering.As always when reviewing a supplement, I wish to state that I am not a medical professional and remind you to seek input (and approval) from your medical provider before taking this or any supplement.
B0013OXA5Y While this won't get rid of an active prostate infection, it works very well at keeping my husband's prostate issues at bay after the infection is gone.
B0013OXA5Y Supports Cardiovascular Function- I have always been a fan of Jarrow and this product hasn't changed my mind. Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets does everything that they claim to do for me. I have used this particular product for about three months. I have blood work regularly done for my high cholesterol, among other problems. I haven't noticed any magical changes, but have noticed a slight dip in my try's and cholesterol. This is great, because my Try's and Cholesterol has continued to increase over the past twenty years and I have used every pharmaceutical medication offered since 1990, as well as watching my diet. To no avail, nothing has helped lower these or prevent the increase until using Pomguard 425 mg pills. I do have heart disease and while continuing my use of mentioned meds, I use Jarrow as a supplement because I'm allergic to niacin, the most common supplement.Provides Antioxidant Protection- I am aware that pomegranates has long been known as an method of antioxidants. I have researched the use of pomegranates and good health for a while. My 94 year old grandmother had pomegranates trees long before the research proved it is an antioxidant. The older southern people relied on home remedies to help with good health and better living.  What I am saying is I truly believe in natural supplements, much like my southern ancestors, that had a long, good life even before they knew of cancer. I highly suggest that anyone of any age use such products.
B0013OXA5Y Potential health benefits per WiKi:In preliminary laboratory research and clinical trials, juice of the pomegranate may be effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including LDL oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation. In mice, \"oxidation of LDL by peritoneal macrophages was reduced by up to 90% after pomegranate juice consumption...\".In a limited study of hypertensive patients, consumption of pomegranate juice for two weeks was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. Juice consumption may also inhibit viral infections[54] while pomegranate extracts have antibacterial effects against dental plaque.Despite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used evolving research results for product promotion, especially for putative antioxidant health benefits. In February 2010, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven antioxidant and anti-disease benefits.
B0013OXA5Y The use of Pomegranate is said to have very rich antioxidant properties, the development if. Supplement makes it easier to benefit from this fruit. The juice itself takes time to acquire a taste, which I still have not, so the pill form is a great idea!
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these for a while and feel better, more energized!! I have not had any negative side effects. Reading up on the ingredients, this is a good formula. I'm starting to really like Jarrow.
B0013OXA5Y Wow, I didn't know that Pomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity!I was taking those ( tea and red wine extract)in supplement form, along with drinking green tea (without milk or sweeteners for its antioxidant properties, definitely not \"yummy\", but best utilized when taken that way.However I have switched to this Pomguard. it is one of those things that I have not \"felt\" any difference but due to the family history of heart trouble & high blood pressure it is just smart to be proactive in this area! Not to mention it is cheaper than what I was spending on less effective antioxidants, so for me it is a great value!
B0013OXA5Y I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure but am currently not on any medication.  Fortunately, since stopping the medication, my blood pressure has been stable.  However, I don't want to take chances.  Jarrow's Pomguard is an anti-oxidant to help with your cardiovascular system and blook pressure.  So far I'm very impressed with it.  I took my blood pressure every day and it never went up while taking this supplement.  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y It's best to get your nutrients from whole foods, rather than supplements.  This isn't always practical however.  Pomegranates can be expensive and they're not always in the stores, plus they can be messy to eat.PomGuard contains a wide variety of polyphenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagiannins.  I had to look these up, since I wasn't exactly sure what these were.  I knew they were good for me, but that was about it.  These are powerful antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation.Why I like this product:* The pills are gel caps, small and easy to swallow.* The pills don't have an unpleasant smell, like several other supplements.* It's an easy way to get antioxidant protection.  Plus, each pill has a concentrated amount of the polyphenolic compounds.* The pills are easy on my stomach.  I suffer from gastritis and acidic fruits like pomegranate can make me feel very nauseous.  I can take the pills with no side effects.As with any supplement, you should check with your doctor before taking these.  These can interfere with statins or blood pressure medication.I do recommend these as a great way to add more antioxidants to your diet.  Of course, eating the whole foods is better, but this can be a nice supplement to that.
B0013OXA5Y I liked the tart taste of this fruit, but they were messy and slow to eat, and so these days, I'm quite content taking these easy-to-take tablets.  They offer all the health benefits of pomegranates without the nuisance of eating.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Most sources tell you pomegranates are a big deal super food.  They and pomegranate juice are expensive, however, and the juice may have added sugars to make it tastier so that's added calories.  This Jarrow pomegranate extract is probably the way to go to pay out less money and consume less calories.Depending on what source you read, you can find that pomegranates do everything from help you lose weight to prevent cancer.  There's not yet hard evidence to substantiate most assertions.  However, since pomegranates are rich in polyphenols and have antioxidant value, anyone gung-ho antioxidants will be happy to take this supplement.  There's little evidence you can be harmed and a good chance it may help y
B0013OXA5Y If you're like me, you know you need to get more antioxidants in your daily diet - antioxidants are said to fight against cancer (by eliminating free radicals) and improve cell and heart functions: Jarrow POMGUARD provides 60 VEGETARIAN capsules as a dietary supplement, and includes 100% California Pomegranates.  And I absolutely ADORE pomegrantes, but they available for such a short period every year, so in the meantime (and if you don't eat up a bunch of blueberries instead), this is a great way to get your pomegranate OUT of Season :)...I would definitely recommend!
B0013OXA5Y If I had to name my favorite fruit, pomegranate would make it on the top of the list.  Some members of my family are mesmerized when I spend long time cleaning the big pomegranate fruit.  Others took more practical approach.  They bought me a special tool that cleans the fruit quickly  - but I still find it pleasant to clean it manually; it is almost a form of meditation.When I saw that Jarrow company offers product called PomGuard, I had to check it out.  This dietary supplement is made of 100% California pomegranate extract. Supplement comes in a capsule and it is easy to swallow with a little bit of water.  Directions indicate that one can take 1-2 capsules a day (morning and/or evening).  Pomegranate fruit contains powerful antioxidants.  This particular supplement helps promote cardiovascular function, it reduces oxidative damage from free radicals and supports healthy cell replication.I guess if there was any other way to make this supplement, I would like it to come in a chewable form.  One of the beauty of pomegranate fruit is its juicinesss, which is obviously missing when supplement comes in a form of a capsule.  However, I am still happy my body gets to enjoy the advantages of this heavenly fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I really like supplements, which are derived from a food source, that give me extra nutrition.  As it isn't possible to eat in a single day all the things that keep one healthy, these supplements take the goodness of pomegranates and provide us with two important preventative benefits: antioxidants and heart health.  I felt great taking this product and I am sure it improved my health as well.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful Antioxidant solution. PomGuard is a multifunctional supplement helping to support cardiovascular function (blood flow/heart health) as well as a strong antioxidant. Each capsule contains 425mg of Pomegranate Extract. You simply take one capsule a day and you're on your way to better health. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking a fruit supplement.
B0013OXA5Y Every so often, we are told of a new 'Superfood'.John Kellogg thought corn flakes were a superfood in the 1800s.Red is the new health color, pushing green aside...for the moment. I already take Jarrow anti-oxidant and Resveratrol formulas, so perhaps this is overkill. Still, can't hurt, might help!
B0013OXA5Y I've taken a lot of pomegranate pills over the years they help to keep me healthy. These work as well as any others I have taken and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I drink POM and if you drink POM you know how expensive it is. This bottle is definitely worth the price to get the effects of pomegranate (in my opinion) I'd also rather take these than drink POM myself, as I'm not a fan of the taste. I like the brand Jarrow, is it my favorite? No, but this seemed to work fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow is the perfect choice for supplements, because they provide superior quality products at an excellent price that don't disappoint. This potent Pomguard formula is not an exception. It delivers a high dose of antioxidants that work magic on the body. I personally love this product. Highly recommended for its potential health quality and reasonable price.
B0013OXA5Y Pomguard is a good supplement for increasing cardiovascular health and for slowing aging because of its antioxidant properties. It puts the healing power of pomegranates in concentrate. It is easier to use than eating promogranates themselves which have a lot of seeds. Drinking the juice is okay, but this supplement is better if you are looking to avoid fructose sugar intake. According to Dr. Mercola, fructose sugar is unhealthy beyond 25 grams a day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have recently been hailed as a super-food good for the heart/cardiovascular system as well as an excellent antioxidant. Pomegranate juice has suddenly become a big item in health food stores and groceries all across the country as a result. It seems the fruit itself isn't something people like to deal with, despite it actually being much easier to prepare for eating than the tons of seeds lead one to expect. It is also a seasonal fruit, and not a cheap fruit. The solution we've been provided is a capsule containing what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients of the fruit, in particular ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Most of the supplements currently available on the store shelves contain synthetic forms of these ingredients that are almost certainly inferior to the natural, straight-from-the-pomegranate forms. Even drinks advertised as pomegranate juice usually contain only a small amount of the real stuff, so read the labels before buying!It will be years before we know if pomegranates actually provide the benefits we now expect, but it has been a popular medicinal fruit for thousands of years in several cultures. This Jarrow product is the best of the pomegranate-derived supplements I've encountered to date, so I'm going to keep buying buying and taking it.
B0013OXA5Y I'm becoming a fan of the Jarrow Forumulas product line. So far I've been taking these for about two and a half weeks and zero issue. I'm a big fan of pomegranate juice in general so I get my fill of antioxidants both fresh and preserved. These Pomguard tablets are easy to swallow and so far, no side effects. I don't feel any extra burst of energy or anything hyperbolic like that, but nor have I had anything like upset stomachs or things of the sort.  So far, so good.
B0013OXA5Y If you're reading this review, you probably already know that pomegranates are a potent source of many types of nutrients. It's hard to get and use fresh pomegranates, so if you're looking for a pomegranate supplement I can recommend this one. I can't address the results of taking it over time, but I do feel like it infuses my system with a wonderful antioxidant support and I trust Jarrow as a company. You get a high concentration of all the active portions of the pomegranate fruit.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great way to add pomengranates and their anti-oxidents to your diet. My stomach has felt better and I feel bet
B0013OXA5Y My husband and I take certain supplements every day for different needs.  We both have low blood pressure so we need to be careful with those supplements that can lower it even more.  Antioxidants are a good way to keep healthy but they can cause a decrease in blood pressure if taken in large doses.  The suggested dose is to take a capsule one or two times a day after a meal.  Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract.One capsule a day is enough for my husband and I take one capsule every other day.  This is the only way we can keep our blood pressure stable and yet get the benefit of the supplement.  This might mean that people with high blood pressure could benefit from the pomegranate extract.As with any other supplement, my recommendation is to do research before any purchase especially if considering taking this supplement in combination with others.
B0013OXA5Y I can't say with certainty but it seems like there is enough evidence out there that this supplement is beneficial to cardiac health.  Jarrow Formulas is a good brand that is well trusted.  The pills are easy to swallow for me and I have had no negative effects.  I am not sure if there are positive effects or not, but research encourages me to continue taking the product.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are a well known source of antioxidants, however, many of us are not able to have an affordable supply of them throughout the year. PomGuard is a great substitute for those times when you can't get fresh pomegranates. In fact, it might even be better, because the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel is used, instead of just part of it.PomGuard is primarily taken for circulatory health, regulation of cholesterol, healthy blood platelets, normal cell function, and stimulating and supporting healthy cartilage life. As with most vitamins and supplements, it is best taken with a meal to avoid any stomach upset. I have not had any problems with off-taste, stomach upset or repeating while consuming these.PomGuard comes in easy to swallow Vegetarian (gelatin) capsules and are made from 100% California Pomegranates. I cannot find any information stating that these are organic or non-GMO.
B0013OXA5Y I chose to rate Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 5 stars because it is a great supplement. The company Jarrow seems to have placed a lot of research into this product, I love the formulationI also appreciate them not adding any additional \"fillers\" to the product, just 100% Pomegranate Extract. It is Wheat/Gluten/soy/dairy free and vegetarian/vegan friendly.I rotate this supplement with a few others to spread their benefits longer. For instance one day I'll take this supplement and another day i may take MK-7, another day I'll take Methyl B-12, etc.Overall, a great supplement for cardiovascular function, fights free radicals and supports heathly cells!
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow talks about the many possible health benefits of their PomGuard product. Among them are: healthy platelet activity, healthy levels of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), prostate, antioxidant, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial benefits, and more.Whether or not those can be substantiated is really a question that I cannot answer in this review.What I can tell you is that Jarrow's product provides the benefits of the entire pomegranate fruit - juice, seed, and peel. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane and seed contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. The PomGuard capsule provides fruit extract from 100% California pomegranates, with nothing synthetic or artificial.I can also say that I've felt great since taking these daily. I simply cannot tell you - without a complete medical exam - whether they have actually contributed to all of the benefits ascribed to the product.
B0013OXA5Y I long ago discovered the wonderful taste of pomegranate during a visit to Israel.  It's one of their revered \"seven species\" of fruits/vegetables (along with olives, dates, etc).  In the process, I learned of the super health benefits of the fruit, especially its antioxidant properties.  Here in the Midwest, one cannot always readily buy a fresh pomegranate.  There are processed juices available, but those are often diluted and/or modified.  Now, this Jarrow Formulas Pomguard allows me easy access to the benefits of pomegranate daily, and at a reduced cost to buying the fresh fruit (granted, I'm missing the great taste experience).This supplement comes in the form of a typical clear capsule containing a brownish powder.  Recommended dose is one capsule one or two times daily after meals, with a capsule providing 425 mg of pomegranate extract from California pomegranates (and nothing else).  60 vegetarian friendly capsules per bottle. Contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, or nuts.  And Jarrow is a highly reputable manufacturer - I take several of their supplements.The label has a boilerplate \"consult your physician\" warning for people with medical conditions or taking medications.  ok.I have experienced no ill or other side effects after taking these.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great and easy supplement.  Once again Jarrow makes a quality product.  The research behind pomegranate is a little fuzzy and people use it for all types of conditions from breathing better to flu treatment to improved blood flow.  I find that it has a moderate breathing enhancement, but it is hard to say if that is weather related or not.  Either way, if you are looking for a pom supplement that is quick and easy, this one is for you.  Personal trial and opinion about what pom does for you is the best course of action.  I use it, I like it.  It helps me, maybe it will help you too.
B0013OXA5Y Good for keeping the blood pressure down. My bp has been creeping up in recent years but I believe that this, plus a couple of other supplements has helped bring it down. I absolutely love Jarrow Formulas, not only are they affordable, but also a very reliable brand.
B0013OXA5Y Taking Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful way to get the antioxidant power of pomegranates in a cost effective pill. Pomguard supports cardiovascular function, reduces oxidative damage by free radicals, and supports healthy cell replication and function.Like others who have posted reviews, I have been spending lots of money on pomegranate juice and love being able to get the same benefits for less money.Jarrow's products are top shelf products and I trust them completely.
B0013OXA8G I've been taking Jarrow formulas for years, this is a good product.  Phosphatydlserine is a fairly expensive supplement, and this one is one of the lowest priced one's I've found, in a good brand.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinal is a reduced form of Co-Q10. What that means in simple terms is that it is the reduced active antioxidant state of Co-Q10. This is the type made by cells in the body and is much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, especially as people age.As it says on the bottle, \"Jarrow Formulas QH-absorb is a proprietary enhanced stability formula, which has been clinically shown in humans to increase Co-Q10 levels up to 777% (6.14X) over baseline at 300 mg per day intake.\"This sounds good to me. These are very big black pills. Serving size, as stated on the bottle, is one per day.Each softgel contains 100mg of Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Kaneka QH is a registered trademark of the Kaneka Corporation of Japan.The bottle states that these are gluten free. Other ingredients as stated are: Medium chain trigycerides, phosphatidylcholine (from soy lecithin), beeswax, rosmarinic acid, vitamin E, and ascorbyl palm itate. Softget consists of gelatin, glycerin and water. Carob extract and caramel added. Contains: Soy.Ubiquinol is a fat soluable substance, meaning it must have fat to be absorbed. I take these with my fattiest meal of the day, to hopefully have as much absorbed as possible. Who knew that the Co-Q10 I've been taking all these years wasn't being absorbed well? I didn't!I take over 12 supplements a day, and Co-Q10 has been one of the leading ones I've always taken. I feel that this particular blend from Jarrow will probably be much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, particularly when I take it with food that has some fat in it. I like the Jarrow brand, since I've known and trusted them for years.
B0013OXABS CO Q10 has been highly touted for some time to be an extraordinarily beneficial supplement.The additional Ubiquinol QH absorb Jarrow formula takes it a step further in providing an additional path to absorption, particularly as the user gets older.It has been stated that absorption levels decline with age.With that in mind, it is anticipated that this formula will be more beneficial.Cons are the price but every CO Q10 formula, worth its 'salt', has been pricey.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a form of Coenzyme Q-10 that is better absorbed. Clinical studies have found that it holds great promise in improving cardiovascular, renal and oral health as well as male fertility. It improves energy and may help in slowing the aging process.I found the soft gels easy to swallow with no discernible side effects. At this juncture it is hard to guage any benefits. Overall Jarrow is a reliable company that produces high quality products. I do feel bet
B0013OXABS I have been taking this cardiovascularly protective supplement for years and will continue to do so.  Great product, easy to swallow gel cap.
B0013OXABS How can you judge how well a supplement is working? You can't! However, I have read that Ubiquinol is better than regular CoQ10 in general and I have trusted Jarrow over a few years, so I have nothing bad to say.
B0013OXABS This ubiquinol is a nice product at a good price.As people get older, their natural supply of coq10 drops, and they have difficulty converting coq10 to ubiquinol, which is an important to help produce cellular energy and to fight free radicals.  In fact, some benefits of ubiquinal are supposedly:  heart health, anti-aging, blood pressure reduction, fight free-radicals, boost immune system and support nervous system, much of this supported by various scientific literature.  Ubiquinol can be directly absorbed, and hence there is some literature stating that people over age 40 should consider supplementing with it.I can't speak to all the alleged health claims, but I can say that I do _think_ I have more energy due to the ubiquinol supplementation.The Jarrow pills are a decent size and swallow easily.  The price is good.  What's not to like?
B0013OXABS When it comes to taking supplements, my stomach usually says \"no!\"  In addition to this, there are many foods that I can't eat so I am always searching for new products that could help me and not throw my stomach into a turmoil.Thus far I have not been disappointed by Ubiquinol QH-Absorb 100 mg, 60 Softgels.  At the present time, I am only taking one per day but I have noticed that I have more energy.  In time, I will increase the dosage and see what happens. Give this product a try; I believe it will make a difference. Believe me, my stomach could get a job as a vitamin or supplement tester. But everyone is different so check with your health provider.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for several weeks and have noticed that my energy level is at a consistently higher level. In addition, QH-absorb(the reduced form of Co-Q10) has been shown to improve heart health and function(as well as to lower blood pressure). There are other various immune and antioxidant benefits but the supplement needs be taken consistently and over a long period in order to attain the beneficial results.
B0013OXABS CoQ10 is a top supplement that probably everyone over 40 should take. This is a very good price per dose and Jarrow products are always high quality.
B0013OXABS I consider this to one of the of key supplements on my must take daily list. Coenzyme q10 is essential for optimal cell function and decreases as we age. If you are taking a cholesterol lowering drug it is even more important to take as statins lower the amount of CQ10 the liver makes. The Ubiquinol version is superior in that it allows your body to actually absorb the stuff more efficiently. So to summarize, if you've decided to supplement with coq10, this is the product to take. It may be a little more expensive but you are more likely to get the benefits in this form.
B0013OXABS I have taken this dosage of CO-Q as Ubiquinol for a few years so I can't say that these are more or less effective. From what I've read, if you are over 40 you want to take Ubiquinol (reduced Co-Q10) rather than regular CO-Q. I was surprised to find that even though these soft gels were of the same strength as my other brand, they were very large compared to the tiny football shaped gels I usually take. They are roughly 1 inch by just under 5/8's of an inch. If you have issue's swallowing pills these are probably not for you. They also contain more ingredients than I am used to seeing, medium chain trilycerides, phoshatidylcholine (from soy), beeswax, rosmanic acid, vitamin E and ascrblyl palmitate. They are gluten free and nut free for those of you with allergies but they do not say GMO free. Though Jarrow is a good company, almost all of the soy grown in the U.S. contains GMO's. I will stop taking these for that reason.
B0013OXABS This is a highly-absorbable &#34;reduced form&#34; of CoQ10 (anti-oxidant). According to Jarrow it has &#34;enhanced stability.&#34; It is a fairly large softgel, so if you have difficulty swallowing, this might not be the pill for you. It's close to an inch long.I always like to cut capsules open to see exactly what I'm putting in my body. Inside of this one is a light greenish thin oily, slightly stinky liquid. Although it's slightly stinky, it does not create any bad burps like fish oil pills. The soft shell consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water, so not considered vegetarian if you avoid glycerin.Serving suggestion is 1 per day, although you can take up to 1 soft gel three times per day.

B0016KV73W Used it numerous times in less than 60 days! My daughter was potty trained the first weekend of November 2013. I took this with us on a trip into my office for a backup plan. She has great bladder control (can last upwards of three hours). We left the office after three hours and put her in the back of my SUV with the potty and me (not a ton of extra room but we managed....wanted to give her some privacy from prying eyes :)) she never saw this thing before. She sat right on it and did her business (#1). This portable solution fits in a large tote or purse. I have used it to attach to a regular toilet on the go (just used it tonight at a friend's house at a child's bday party). Very easy.The liners are good. No leaks. I purchased extra liners too. I haven't tried rigging a regular plastic bag with paper towels yet. Afraid of leaks.With newly potty trained tots, I think you need a convenient solution for an immediate need. Buy it!
B0016KV73W I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the \"wings\" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.  It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag). But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.  (It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.) I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.  It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!
B0016KV73W I love this potty! Much easier to use this then hold my 14 month old son over a regular toilet every morning to do his business! We part time EC, and this has been working perfectly, wish I had bought it sooner! He loves it set up on the floor, & has become much more interested in going #1 in the potty as well!To those complaining that it collapses on their little ones, you don't have it set up correctly. You need to push the legs into the potty base till you here each side click. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on potette plus set up.I purchased the silicone reusable insert for the potty so we don't have to mess with bags... Much greener and cheaper! I bought the potty & liner for $15 bucks, you really can't beat that!
B0016KV73W This is so perfect. We go to the beaches all the time and there are no bathrooms and a child learning to potty can't hold it til we find a toilet somewhere. This works perfect. Small, easy, secure. I love that it also comforts to a toilet seat to put on an adult toilet seat in a public restroom. I use it most though for our beach trips. The liner you can buy for it works great but when I run out and haven't ordered none regular grocery bags work just as well.***edit. Oct. 5th, 2012 I had to order another one since we lost or had our stolen when we were getting some maintenance done on our car and it was in our car :( but soon as i realized it was missing I was online ordering another one because this is the best invention in the world especially for long trips, beach trips, or out anywhere that just doesn't have potties, especially for a little one that can't hold it like adult can, when my 2 year old says I have to potty she has to go and go NOW so its great to have in the car when there just isn't a store or gas station around for her to go potty at. I ordered 3 packs of refills with my original purchase and still have 2 full packs left LOVE LOVE THIS product and so does my daughter she has no problem going on it***
B0016KV73W Pros-Travels easy (it fits in my diaper bag) & it has a travel bagSecures great on the pottyYou can do it as a free standing for out & about emergencies ( they have an insert you can buy)It gives my toddler confidence that he's not going to fall inConsIf you use it as a stand alone the legs have to be locked in & it was a little hard for me to snap into placeI've bought 2 - one for home & one for travel. He loves it, this was the only thing that was worth a darn besides the primo potty
B0016KV73W This seat is such a convenient thing to have! It is small enough to put in a backpack or diaper bag and it comes with a storage bag. It makes sitting on public toilets easier (for kids and parent) and could be its own potty in an emergency. The only reason that I deducted a star is one design \"flaw\" that I'm not sure if they could do anything about. The front bottom is shaped/sized so that if my son's aim isn't down enough, it will actually cause the stream to start splattering. He's usually good about it and it isn't the end of the world to clean up a little, but I think it could be better in that respect. Would definitely recommend.
B0016KV73W This is extremely handy for an outing, especially when potty training a 2 year old. It took me some time to figure out how to lock the legs in place, but it's not a big deal now. My only complaint would be that the legs are so short, so even my two year old's knees end up in his chest. But I guess that's what you get for portable.
B0016KV73W This potty was a total impulse buy for me, before we started potty training my son.  I thought it looked cool, and I was pregnant with my 2nd, so I bought it on a whim.  However, it was SO worth the money!  We are outside a LOT, especially at parks/playgrounds....and I'm not going to lie, I just can't handle the port-a-potty.  I can't do it!  So, this has really saved us from having to pack up and go home early.  We keep it in the back of our car, and just set it up whenever we need it.  We've never really used it as a seat cover, just as a travel potty.  I can fit it in my diaper bag, but it takes up a lot of room.  It would be nice if it were smaller, but for what it does, I highly recommend it!
B0016KV73W My almost 3 year old daughter falls through the opening when sitting on it. She also tells me &#34;it hurts my butt&#34;. It will be in our next yard sale needless to say. I was hoping this would work for her. I even tried putting her foam cushion from her home potty seat on the top and she still refuses to use it. The foam isn't a perfect fit and just makes it clumsy feeling to her. The opening is way too big for a typical child of 2 to 3 years of age in my opinion. My daughter is not petite either.
B0016KV73W My son is in the 97th percentile and about 2 1/2.  This thing was so tiny it was a joke.  I could see how it might be great if it was appropriately sized for your child, but it is definitely not the answer if you have a bigger than average kiddo.
B0016KV73W We initially got this for our petite 2 year old. He was already going potty in a little froggy potty (also bought on Amazon) and was doing so well but it became a problem when we would go out in public because he was terrified to use the large toilets. So we bought this and it solved the problem! So small and extremely easy clean up. He has even gone in the car with this little potty. Needless to say, he didn't end up using it a ton since he eventually got brave enough to use a normal toilet but we still keep it in our truck in it's nice little bag just in case or if we need to use while on the road. Great product!
B0016KV73W The potette is really portable and well-made, but I think I was happier with my ikea potty - it took up a little more space and didn't fold down or convert to a training seat (which is cool) but at least I didn't have to use plastic bags with it (I don't buy the potette liners - they seem pointless. I just use an old plastic bag and a rag or cloth diaper in the bottom, and then wait until I'm somewhere I can offload the poop without having to send another plastic bag to a landfill). I would love to figure out an \"on the go\" solution for the potette that didn't require a plastic bag at all. On the other hand - the potette is thoughtfully made and small enough to fit my one year old, who much prefers to use a potty than a diaper.
B0016KV73W I bought this potty to keep in the car for when we are out and about. In the &#34;potty&#34; position (legs down) it isn't sturdy at all because the legs don't lock in that position. Twice it has collapse under the my baby which has led to epic meltdowns. So in reality it's just a travel toilet reducer. Not very 2-in-1.
B0016KV73W This was the best buy I could have done for the summer vacation on the beach. We went to Europe on vacation and it is usual  there not to have restrooms available on the beach so I was worried about how to handle my 3 year old potty training phase. I bought this product and it has proven to be phantastic!!! Clean and easy to use and comfortable for the kid. Size is also quite reasonable as it fits perfectly in the beach bag. All my friends with kids same age wanted to get it too.
B0016KV73W I bought this because I needed a portable potty for my son. He is fully potty trained but doesnt tell us he needs to go until he is about to pee himself. I was really tired to hovering him over the toilet (thank goodness he is small for his age or else id drop him right in) especially with a bad back and weak arms. I was really looking into the foldup ones for convenience but saw that it was not sturdy and did not fit public toilets. I am so glad i found this. it folds up nicely and is sturdy. I am so happy i read reviews because i found on another review that to use it in a sitting position/potty you have to push it up to lock in place. Anyways the day i got this in the mail my sister took my kids and me to the park and as soon as we got there my son was doing the pee pee dance. I pulled this out, popped the legs in place, popped the baggy in it, put it behind the tree, shimmied down his chones and plopped him on there. He was a bit confused cuz the bag and all but he did his thing and it was all gravy. We also used it on our toilet at home. He loves it. And i love it. =)
B0016KV73W My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.
B0016KV73W We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.
B0016KV73W let me just say this potty seat is amazing! It's sturdy, little enough to put almost anywhere, folds down great. I bought some extra liners, but in my opinion save your money & buy the reusable liner that goes with this seat. Also wonderful quality, and come on, how hard is it to dump out & wipe with a wet wipe.
B0016KV73W This is the best baby product ever invented!  It's cheap, sturdy & fits in my kid's skip hop bag.  We have had potty training success because of this gem!  She's going on her 3rd week of PT & this weekend we took her to Disney on Ice & a weekend trip to the beach.  The crowds in public restrooms I think intimidate her but I just put this potty on the back seat of the car in the parking lot & wha la! When the crowds are smaller I use the handicap stall & set this potty up on the side & we take a potty break together.  On the beach I set up her potty in a play tent & she had her own little outhouse.  She loves her new potty & so do I!  We no longer have to fear accidents or her holding it too long till she feels comfortable.  The liners are super absorbant so you don't have a messy, leaking bag to deal with.  I won't leave home without it.  Thank you inventers of the potette travel potty.  THANK YOU!
B0016KV73W Seriously, whoever came up with this invention is even better than Henry Ford for inventing cars; hands-down this is the greatest purchase I have made for my 18mo daughter...and we've purchased a LOT!  My daughter said \"potty?\" the other day while in public, and was terrified of me holding her over the big (nasty) public restroom potty and wouldn't go...so in the diaper it was, poor thing. So we purchased this potty on the suggestion of a fellow Mom.I was skeptical, as my daughter is used to a padded seat, that sits on our big toilet (we've gone that route and not a mini-potty...she's done amazing starting at about 16mos~) so I was a bit concerned on whether or not she would understand what this was (when used as a stand-alone potty on the floor/ground):  it came in the mail, I opened it, popped out the legs and locked them in place (**you have to pull them out to standing position, then push them upwards into the seat until you hear them click**) and set it on the floor...she immediately exclaimed \"potty!!!\" and sat down to hang out.  SUCCESS!!  From here on out this new travel potty was my bff.I keep it in it's plastic bag, in our diaper bag 24/7...it paid for itself twice already: having it at my parent's house 3hrs away to pop the legs to the side and put on the big potty, when I didn't think to bring her usual potty seat, and again when we were on the beach and she said \"potty\".  I don't go anywhere without it, ever.It comes with plastic bags that will hook around it, that they pee/poo into when you'er on the go, and inside is a little \"pad\" to soak it all up...don't waste your money on more of these specialty bags...use some plastic grocery store bags, and line them with the thick maxi pads...it's the same exact thing, and a FRACTION of the cost since you can buy cheapo brand pads.BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
B0016KV73W This toilet helped make potty training so easy for us. We brought it to the park, the playground, shopping. I was a little shy using it indoors in public (although would in a pinch so long as I could find a somewhat quiet, uninhabited corner somewhere), but had NO shame whatsoever having my daughter cop a squat at the playground or wherever outdoors. And when we were running errands, I would open the back of my SUV, and have her sit there and go. I would just stand in front of her for safety and to give her a bit of privacy. Also, when I was pregnant, it helped me avoid public restrooms and having to hold my almost three year old over a toilet, big belly and all. I cannot recommend this enough.
B0016KV73W We carry this with us in the car whenever we go out.  It has a little plastic case that comes with it, but we use that to store the bags, and got a separate (washable) bag to carry the potty in.  It's fantastic.  Going out to eat and don't want to balance your toddler on the big toilet seats?  Bring this along, lay it flat and your toddler is comfortable and protected from germs!  On a road trip and don't want to risk a gas station restroom, or your toddler needs to go NOW and you're on a stretch of open road?  No problem!  You click the potette into the \"seat\" position (note that people complain about the seat collapsing, but it won't do that if you just click the \"legs\" into their place.  You MUST click/lock it in to the upright or flat position, otherwise it's not stable), put it in the back of your wagon,  or in the back seat on a relatively flat surface, or on the side of the road even, your toddler sits down and pees/poops, you tie up the bag and knot it (please don't litter - just store the bag in the back of your car, or the trunk until you can toss it in the garbage - if you knot the bag, you don't smell it), and boom, you are on your way!  My daughter loves it - she prefers going on the potty \"in the car\" rather than going into an unfamiliar restroom, and on more than one occasion, it's been a lifesaver pulling over by the side of the road for an emergency pit stop.It's all plastic and is easily wiped down by a disinfectant wipe, and takes up little room when stored flat.  You can buy refill liners for about 50 cents a bag (I got a 30 pack from Wal-Mart for 40 cents a bag), which some might say is costly, but we only use them when we go out, so 30 should last us a long time.  When we ran out of our initial supply that comes with the potty, I did use plastic grocery bags (make sure there are no holes in the bag!) and some left over absorbent pads from my pregnancy kit.  You can save money by going this route, but you either have to carry around a bag of women's panty liners/pads and grocery bags, or do it up in advance and then fold them all flat so they are ready to go.  That seems like a lot of work to me, so we just buy the pre-made ones from Kalencom.The only \"negative\" I can comment on about this potty is that it's not ideal as your primary potty seat for potty training.  I like that it's all plastic for easy clean-up on the go, but we did end up buying a cushioned potty seat for at-home potty training.  When your toddler is sitting for a long time on the potty, cushioning is nice, and our daughter found this seat too uncomfortable when sitting for long periods of time.  However, now that she is fully potty trained, she could use this seat for everyday use at home just fine.Overall, I highly recommend the Potette and it's definitely one of our best purchases for our toddler.
B0016KV73W This potty lives in my car trunk and its great for car trips and has been used more then I thought it would be.  Only minor issue is the seat sometimes wants to close while my kid is sitting on it but I just hold her and for a 30 second potty break it works perfectly.
B0016KV73W This little portable potty chair has been a life safer as we have traveled around with our almost 3 year old
B0016KV73W This travel potty is on my \"baby must-have\" list.  We've used it while traveling on both long trips and short and also while camping.  It's great to use as a booster potty on those icky campground port-a-potties.  We keep it in the car just in case!
B0016KV73W I really couldn't even tell you how many times this little potty has saved my daughter's outfits, carseat, my van, and my sanity. I don't use it in public restrooms as we have something else we use for those instead. I keep it set up in my van with a bag already lining it (we ran out of those little bags that it comes with, with the absorbent pad to help soak up the liquid, but in a pinch, sassy disposable diaper sacks work wonders!!), and that way when we get the opportunity to pull over there's no wasting time trying to set it up while she does the potty dance. Not sure how it works with boys yet, as my youngest boy has not potty trained yet, but time will tell.Here's what I like:-convenience. I don't have to worry about trying to find someplace with a public restroom to take her in. I can quickly get her on it, take out the used bag, replace it with a new one, and be on the go again in no time.-portability. It doesn't take up much space at all when it is folded up and it fits fairly well in my diaper bag, and j
B0016KV73W We have been so pleased with our &#34;travel potty.&#34;  It is so compact and perfect for traveling.  It fits easily in a backpack or large purse so you can use it anywhere.
B0016KV73W Awesome product.  I travel a fair amount and didn't want to delay or jeopardize potty training my toddler because of my fear of getting stuck somewhere without a toilet.  I used this mostly on top of public toilets for the first few months - and it was GREAT for that.  It reduced the anxiety of my little one trying to go in strange places, especially when he had to sit for a while to, ahem, produce.  We used it on airplane toilets, you name it.  Then one day we were about to get on a subway train in NYC and he announced that he had to go pee... I pulled out the Potette, had it set up in seconds, and he was able to sit and pee in comfort (if not privacy!).  You really do have to push the legs hard to snap them into place so it is sturdy - but if you do that, it is strong enough to hold my 35lb little guy without a problem.  I also love that this is super small, lightweight, and easy to carry around.  Can't say enough good things.
B0016KV73W Like many others here, I had to learn the hard way why the standalone potty won't stay put and the legs kept slipping out from underneath my toddler mid-pottying. It's because each side needs to be pushed to lock in. Then the only caveat is that the legs sometimes pop out of the potty when I pull it back out to unlock it but it's a very minor incovenience compared to having the most accessible potty ever, which is so crucial especially when your toddler is potty training...and especially on vacation...to large parks where restrooms aren't always super accessible (not to mention the lines!)...via a road trip. I can't imagine how we could've survived our last vacation without it. Best invention ever (my husband and I kept saying to one another)! I do agree/have to admit that the seat is very small and very low...but any bigger and it would be a bother to carry around. It's difficult finding the balance between portability and usability when it comes to a portable toilet, but this company certainly made it work.
B0016KV73W I had high hopes for this based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment. It's really flimsy and quite frankly too small to be of any use for my 2-year-old son. Despite following the directions, it kept tipping over every time we used it. Don't waste your money on this. I recommend the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty.  We use that now whenever we go out. The quality of the Bjorn is far superior to the Potette.  That's my .02.
B0016KV73W We have tried so many potty seats that I've lost count.  This one is by far the BEST.  It is compact and fits in my 2 year old's little backpack.  It is very sturdy, and she's comfortable because she does feel like she is falling in.  It cleans up easily, travels well, and is cute.
B0016KV73W Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.
B0016KV73W A friend had referred this product to me when she was potty training her son. It is small enough to take everywhere you go and big enough where the child is comfortable. I have two: one in the car (because who likes using the public restrooms?) and the other in my bathroom (because I have a small bathroom, no extra room for another toilet).
B0016KV73W I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0016KV73W This is really great and we have gotten lots of use from it! We have used it as a potty seat over toilet and it can also be used to keep in your car in case your child needs to use the potty. This is a great all in one potty seat and we really love it!
B0016KV73W I take this chair everywhere with me! It fits sturdily on every type of toilet seat I have tried it on. It has little rubber strips on the underside of the legs/seat support that hold it in place. It folds up small enough to fit in a side pocket of my diaper bag or a large purse. When my son uses it it puts him in the right position to entirely miss peeing on the seat (mothers of boys know this is important). My only complaint is that the splash guard in front is kinda wide. To allow him to sit comfortably I have to take one leg out of his pants and underwear, which also involves taking off a shoe. I don't mind this so much since he just turned two and is peeing in public places thanks to this potty but might be a bigger deal to other people. I have never used it as a stand alone chair but I know that the legs must be positioned to point down and then clipped into place to be sturdy. I have tried that part and found it to be very sturdy.
B0016KV73W This may be the best baby product I've bought. My daughter was recently potty trained when we had to go on a very long road trip through rural Oregon. We were very concerned that she would regress and bought this potty out of desperation. It worked wonderfully! The legs are very sturdy when locked in place and work well on uneven ground. The bags are super and we have not experienced a single leak. We've used the &#34;mergnancy potty&#34; everywhere from the back of the SUV to the park to the beach to the side of an interstate highway. It's compact enough to fit in my big purse, so it goes everywhere with us.
B0016KV73W A travel potty is an absolute must for potty training, especially in the early days.  It is literally the difference between a breakthrough success and yet another accident.  This travel potty is exactly what we need.  It's lightweight enough to fit in the diaper bag.  When the legs are snapped into place (which took me a few tries to get right), it is extremely sturdy.  My daughter feels very secure sitting on it - it's not wobbly at all.  It's a very smart design to allow it to be placed over a public toilet too, although we mainly use it as a stand-alone potty.  I keep a bag already loaded on so that it's ready to go at a moment's notice.  We have used it everywhere:  in the front seat, back seat, trunk, on the side of the road, in the park, everywhere.  The absorbent inserts in the bags are brilliant.  The bags contain messes perfectly; we've never had a mishap.  This potty seat affords us a LOT of confidence that even if the urge sneaks up on my daughter, we will still be okay.  Every potty training family needs one of these.
B0016KV73W We are loving this potty seat for our 19 month old. He is usually slow to warm up to new things, but took to this potty seat right away and has been going potty in public restrooms with no problems now. It fits conveniently in the diaper bag. Haven't used as a stand-alone potty seat yet, but can see that double duty can come in handy too. I like this item way better than my sister's quad fold dora the explorer seat for her daughter - that one is very flimsy and I think my son is comfortable on this seat b/c even though it is small and portable it is sturdier. Great buy for ten bucks!
B0016KV73W With the reusable liner we have been able to use the 2-in-1 potette plus at home, in the car, and while traveling.  Great product.
B0016KV73W Love it! Easy to transport, fits in a backpack or handbag. So convenient for potty training on the go. Came in very handy when we went camping.
B0016KV73W So happy with this purchase - and I was sceptical.  1-Because it good TOO many good reviews; and 2-My 2 1/2 year old newly potty trained daughter can be a little particular and dramatic about new things. But I was wrong and made a great choice in my purchase.  It even fits in my tote bag.  It comes with 3 pee bags and a plastic storage bag.  The extra bags and silicone seat insert/liner are separate, but well worth the extra purchase.  The potty does sit very low to the ground, and having a tall child made me think maybe she wouldn't like the way that felt but she is fine sitting low, even though her house potty's are higher.  We use the liner/insert at houses we visit because I can easily dump it and wipe; as well as the bags for in the car or at stores so I can just toss.  I prefer to use the Potette brand bags instead of using a garbage bag with paper towels as some suggested - you never know when there is a small leak.  The bags are easy to use and have little turtles in the bottom pad which make it fun for the child to tinkle on.  The pad is genius - nothing sloshes around!  Although when I have used the silicone insert in the car, I just put paper towels in the bottom and that works just as well. My only, very small, con is manuevering the legs/handles of the pot.  It is not easy.  You have to push each end of each leg/handle all the way in to click, to make it a sturdy sit-on-the-floor potty.  Then they snap out again to fold in to store, or to flip outward to use as a toilet seat.  Our babysitter has issues with this aspect so she actually pulls each handle all the way off, and folds them in and THEN snaps them in to store it. Otherwise she can't go from the locked to the fold position.  Even I have trouble.  But the more you use it the easier it is and it works so well otherwise I will deal with that.  This really is one of the best purchases I've made as a mom so far, it makes running errands with a toddler who doesn't like big toilets so much easier!
B0016KV73W Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  It looks more ring like than seat like.  This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow \"sprayage\" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids \"junk\" and the front of the bowl.  Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
B0016KV73W I got two of these bc we were traveling and boy they were so uncomfortable.  After every time my toddler used it, you can see red marks on both sides of his thighs.We've only used it on top of the regular toilet seat, hadn't try it the other way like we were in the woods or something.
B0016KV73W We are not a fan of this product.  I have the Baby Bjorn ones inside the house which my son loves but he refuses to use this one when we are out and about.  The first time he sat on it it wasn't correctly locked in place and the potty gave way and he fell down.  He's been traumatized every since and now I just bring the Bjorn one along for the ride in the trunk and wasted all of my money on this.
B0016KV73W Great if you travel with a kid in potty training period. It is small enough to be carried around. It can fit even in a larger purse. It is very stable once it is locked in the position. The only problem is unlocking it. I end up with the handles in my hand every time I try to unlock it and I have to put the handles back. I do not know how long the plastic is going to resist to this maneuver.
B0016KV73W This is a great small size and fits comfortably in my bag. I love using this when we are out in public. It folds out nicely where my 2-1/2 year old can hold on to it's handles and not the icky public toilet seat. I love how it folds up very small.  Great product
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to keep in car for going public places, but not small enough to fit in my purse or anything. It is extremely low to the ground when used as a stand-alone potty, so not very useful for that. Will do in a pinch, but my daughter is 3 and already about to outgrown ability to use it on ground.
B0016KV73W Where do I start? I love love love this toilet seat. During my search for a portable potty for my daughter I looked at many different brands and options. But after reading many reviews for this I decided to give it a try even though I worried that it might be bigger than I wanted. When it arrived I knew then its the perfect size. It is such a life saver in many ways. It helped my baby girl toilet train because the kiddie ones with a bucket that you have to throw out is just a bit too gross for me. I do not leave the house without it. I thank god every time we are out and my daughter needs to go but we're at a super disgusting public toilet. I grab a bunch of the seat covers, layer them up and slap this on top and she's ready to go. We've used it in my car too for times that a public toilet is not around which is such a life saver. This way I'm not driving 100 mph looking for the next restroom stop and panicking that she might go in her pants. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B0016KV73W My daughter likes her little \"red potty\".  I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.  I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.  (It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)  The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.  I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).  I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.  I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!  I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.  That is by far the biggest plus!  Especially since my 2 yr old likes \"privacy\" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.  It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.
B0016KV73W During potty training this has been fantastic.  My daughter learned to potty train in a potty chair, but that meant pleading with her to pee before we left the house, and rushing home before the next &#34;potty.&#34;  Once we got this, it was easy to throw in my (large) purse and off we'd go.  She felt much more secure on large public toilets.  Not only that, you have the capability to turn this into an emergency potty chair by folding the legs down instead of out to the side.  It's great for long car trips because we don't have to race to the next exit to find a gas station.  We're able to put this in the hatchback trunk and just let her go there, in the provided liners (you could also use a plastic shopping bag -without holes!).This is great to even just leave in the trunk.
B0016KV73W I really like this product. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it looked so small. But we have used it in the public restrooms and at people's houses and it works great over a toilet. The arms fold out and click into place creating a sturdy seat. The arms also click into place creating a stool like seat for using without a toilet. We have not had the opportunity to try that out yet. As a travel potty it does fit well into a diaper bad. Surprisingly compact.
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!  We keep it in the back of the car at all times.  My daughter is very afraid of &#34;big potties&#34; and this is our solution.  We buy the refill bags and it's so convenient.  I originally bought it for use on a trip and even brought it on the airplane. We still use it now.  On outings I just ask her if she needs to go (usually while exiting or entering the car) and I open up the back hatch of my car, she hops in and goes.  I keep a little pack of diaper wipes in the bag with it.  Then before walking into a store (or the park) I just tie up the bag and toss it in the garbage on my way in.  Nothing to clean up and I don't have to hunch over a public bathroom telling my daughter over and over to stop touching everything.  Sometimes we'll bring it to parks near us that don't have bathrooms.  We've been using this for about 10 months now and are only on our second pack of refill packs.  Totally worth it.
B0016KV73W Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it. We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.  Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.  Once in place it is very stable.  They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.  Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.
B0016KV73W We used this twice. It seriously was much easier to just hold my daughter over a public potty and wash our hands thoroughly than bring this in and take it with us. It's small, yes but it just wasn't fun to lug something else in and out of restaurants, the mall, etc. Plus I felt like we were just carrying germs around with us from one potty to another. It's sort of an unnecessary purchase unless you are using it for camping, the beach, etc. For public potties just use the potty.
B0016KV73W Only use this is a  toilet seat converter for my kiddos.  For this it works well and is nice & compact.  I have a Ju Ju Be Backpack and it fits inside the back zippered change mat section (after taking out the mat which I no longer need) Don't like it as a sit on potty though.  My daughter won't use it as I think it feels unstable to her.  I keep a Cool Gear Travel Potty  in the car for her to use if we can't find a toilet as it's sets up as a sturdy bench seat, it's also higher off the ground than this potette.  Works with the potette bags (or any plastic bag for that matter) so it's a fast disposal just like the pottette.
B0016KV73W Lifesaver for a potty-training 3 year old who is still mostly resistant. This removes the fear of &#34;falling&#34; into the toilet plus the handles keep his tiny hands away from the germ infested seat.  Works great with the Potty Cover or Potty Topper (provides added layer of protection / barrier).  The portability is also a plus. This is a MUST-HAVE for potty training parents.
B0016KV73W We've owned this for a few weeks now and it's simply THE BEST! Every parent with little ones potty training should get one of these! Our girl has used this potty-style in the back of our SUV, in the backseat of our sedan, on the side of the road, at the neighborhood pool, and seated-style on numerous public restrooms. I purchased the disposable bags with these and once I ran out, found a grocery store bag and 2 papertowels folded over works just as well and is more convenient and cheaper than the bags. This potty is comfortable for my girl, easy to transport (comes with a carrying bag), easy to use, easy to clean, convenient, inexpensive and has been invaluable for keeping in the car and using when the moment strikes! Great product! I might consider this my new go-to gift for new parents...even though they'd have to wait a few years until they can use it...it's that wonderful.
B0016KV73W I bought this more to use on public toilets, and the ocassional stand along use.  My son isn't comfortable using it on the big toilet AT ALL.  I don't like that it sits on the very back of the toilet.  When his pants are pulled to the ankles, his legs then have to sit out straight, making sitting very awkward.  And I also can't tell whether he is 'pointed down' because his legs are in the way of me seeing.Perhaps this would be better to use in the back of a minivan or something during a long trip.  But I don't have a huge car, and I don't find it very useful for everyday shopping, errands, etc.
B0016KV73W This is the perfect little potty for our uses: emergencies and on long car trips. I love that it can be used as a seat on a big potty, if you have that option, or on it's own with the bags. I have bought the liners that this company makes to go along with this potty because I like the ease of knowing there won't be spills or leaks if I were to use my own. I also like the ease of not having to carry around both grocery bags and something to put in the bottom of them (although that's a great idea in case I ever find myself without one of Kalencom's liner bags!).We are using this as an emergency potty for our kids ages 9, 6, and 2, although the 9 and 6 year old are able to hold it until we find an actual bathroom better than the 2 year old.
B0016KV73W After a week of potty training at home I knew I had to venture out and have my son sit on a public toilet. The potette fits perfectly on all the public toilets I've tried it on but it does require some getting used to. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age but he fits fine on it but it took a few tries to get him seated properly so he doesn't pee all over the place. I thought I would use the seat as a travel potty for the car as well but I tried sitting my son on it as a toilet and he fell right through to the floor. Since he has been trained on a real toilet with a potty seat he just wasn't used to sitting so low to the ground with nothing to hold on to.While it has been a life saver in public places, it is a pain in the butt to carry around. We rarely use a stroller so it's not an option to throw it in the basket underneath. And I was trying to get away from using a diaper bag anymore since my son is now potty trained. But this potty is just too large to fit in any purse that I own. So it's back to carrying a diaper bag for now and hopefully I can teach my son to pee standing up soon :)
B0016KV73W Pros:-has a raised upper lip so i'm not as scared of my boy peeing all over the place-sturdy ring that does not fold, so no worries about it caving or breaking or pinching-can work both as a potty seat or stand alone potty. we haven't tried the latter feature yet, but basically there are 2 folding legs on each side that fold in when not in use; fold out all the way like wings so that you can place on a toilet seat; & can fold legs 90 degrees to the potty seat itself so that it can be standingCons:-on the smaller side, but works fine for my little guy, who is on the smaller side**It's inevitable that whatever potty set you get, the yucky public toilet will be exposed to your child. So, our system is to bring a travel pack of sanitizing wipes and wipe the toilet seat and anything icky and tempting for toddler to touch (like flusher, sanitary napkin box, etc) and then place potty seat on top. Works great!
B0016KV73W It works as intended. We keep it in the car for our daughter and it can be used in public restrooms. There has been a few emergencies while she's been in the car seat. It's easy to pull over to a private spot, set up the Potette, and let her go. It's definately saved us from car accidents. Some people have complained that the legs fly out from under the seat. I have not found this to be an issue at all. The instructions show that when the legs are pulled out they need to be pushed up to \"click\" into the seat. It's solid when pushed into that position.EDIT: 12/2012 -- We still have this in our car. It's been a long time and still have the original one. It works great. No issues at all. Awesome when you are miles from a toilet and the little one says, \"I gotta go!\"
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!!! it is great for road side emergency potty breaks, fitting onto the toilets when we're out and about, also for at home when my daughter was potty training. I appreciate that it comes in it's own carrying bag so I don't have to store it in one of my own bags. Easy to clean and the bags that it is sold with are perfect.
B0016KV73W Maybe this will be more useful in traveling when my daughter gets older, but it's not working for a toilet topper. It slides around too much and doesn't stay where it needs to stay. Also, it's so thin, it's not very comfortable for my daughter. I really liked the idea of this product though. I hope we can use it in the future.
B0016KV73W I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.  I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to try this little potty for an upcoming trip!  The only problem is that our little one doesn't like it.  She is a very petite (21 pounds, 32 inches) 19 month old and the ring is too big for her.  She looks very uncomfortable on it like she feels she is going to fall through.  It also sits too low to the ground for her.  We will keep it around and hope that maybe she will grow into it and it will be a our \"go-to\" travel potty.  But for now we will search for something else.
B0016KV73W This is a great little travel potty and we have also used it as a portable toilet seat for public restrooms.There are a couple of things that could improve it though.  The legs are so short that even a 34 inch child does not look comfortable sitting on it.  Also, do not allow children to fold the chair back together.  It is easy to pinch your fingers if you are not careful.The Kalencom PLUS works as a toilet seat too for public restrooms and it does the job.  However, I do not like this seat as a portable toilet seat for three reasons. With boys the pee can hit the wrong spot and splatter; the seat is lumpy; and it slips a bit on the toilet.  This product is best used as just a travel potty and it is good for that.  It is nice you can put three of the disposable bags on it in advance and be ready for emergency potty stops.
B0016KV73W This is GREAT for our newly potty training son. Fits great on a regular toilet lid for out and about, and easy to use for stand alone times (saved us at the beach from having to stand in a long line for the restroom for him). I love it and can't say enough great things about it. My only wish (and this is being super nit picky) is that the splash gaurd would be bigger (for boys). But that is just being super pic
B0016KV73W I can't explain how impressed and happy i am with this product. I bought it for my 2 year old for a camping trip but we had an emergency and we travelled in the philippines. It made our life a lot easier because we don't have to rush and stop somewhere when my daughter needs to potty. We used it when we are out and i don't feel comfortable about my daughter using the public toilets and we even use it inside the car ( i just sit her in the back) .. This product was worth every penny, i highly recommend it if you travel a lot and good for those who are starting potty training
B0016KV73W I bought this product for my twin girls who are almost 2 and a half and we've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's the best travel potty ever! Folds very easily and can fit in a medium-sized bag. Super easy to use. Nice color. We tried another potty before this one and one of my little girls kept saying &#34;it hurts, mommy&#34;. We never had such a problem with this potty. We've traveled with it the whole summer and it's been a lifesaver on so many occasions! I can't imagine traveling without it! I do think that the liners are overpriced but that's not too big an issue -- You can always use this potty with other small plastic bags. Highly recommended.
B0016KV73W My two year old just started potty training and I knew we would need something we could use when we are out of the house. I love that it can be used as a stand alone potty or as a seat on a regular toilet. This potty usually gets used as a stand alone with the bag inserts, which I really like and are biodegradable. We haven't used it for long so I don't know how durable it will be but it does seem to be pretty good quality plastic and will hopefully last through two kids. It's sturdy when the legs are locked in place and pretty small when folded down. Our toddler seems to feel secure on it as it gets used frequently. I'm really glad we bought this and for the price you can't beat it.
B0016KV73W Bought for traveling with twin 2-year-olds.  When placed on a regular toilet, this seat bends a bit at the seams when the kids sit on it.  This makes them feel unsteady.  They rejected it completely at first.  On a second trip, they were a bit more willing to try, but still not as comfortable as the Bjorn seats we use at home.  Very small when in the stand-alone position.  Might work better once they're actually potty trained instead of just starting.
B0016KV73W We kept this in the back of the car and used it several times.  It works great, and is so easy to clean up.  Love it!
B0016KV73W We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose. My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues. My only complaint is buying the bags. They can be costly when you use it as often as we do. And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store! I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in. I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof. I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas. Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier. 
B0016KV73W We have loved this potty - it's easily portable and works great at home too.  It's our all around potty for our 2 1/2 yr old.  Some reviewers said the seat was small - we haven't found that to be the case but he does seem less comfortable on it than he is on his little potty that has a foam/rubber ring for comfort (he squirms a little on this seat).  However, now that he's not sitting on the potty just waiting to go, he does just fine on this seat for the length of time it takes him to potty.  I would have given this 5 starts if it seemed a little more comfortable for him.  
B0016KV73W Haven't used it a lot yet but so far this is great.  Has been sturdy and comfortable on toilet.  Haven't used it alone but when snapped in properly seems it will be fine.  Bought another to keep in each car.
B0016KV73W I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.
B0016KV73W I have one in each of our cars and one in the stroller. Our nanny hates going to public restroom in the part because a lot of homeless people go there so she will use the potette every day letting our daughter do her business in the park. The bags are a bit expensive but grocery bags so often have holes I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have also used it in restaurants when they have no seat liner and I still put some toilet paper on the toilet seat towards the front that the potette doesn't cover. Many times we have pulled over or exit freeway to find a parking lot where my daughter can go potty. One times she did it inside our car but she bent her leg too high and the pee kinda squirt out of the potette so I make sure she straighten her legs when she as to pee. Overall it is a great product. You do have to make sure the legs snap in place when using as a chair. IMO, even if I only use it once it is totally worth the money so my daughter doesn't have to touch any dirty toilet seat or when she needs to go while we are driving somewhere.
B0016KV73W We do not go anywhere without the potette in our car!  We have been using the same one for about 2 years now and it is fantastic.  It is small enough to fit in your diaper bag (really, smaller and lighter than you would think) and incredibly sturdy.  Those who commented that it is not sturdy are not properly snapping it into place.  I had this problem initially, but once I got the hang of it, it is sturdy enough for even a very desperate adult ;)  We usually don't bother with the bags - we just find a nice patch of grass on the side of the road (we live in the country) and let the pee hit the grass - works like a charm!
B0016KV73W Caution for boys - the splash guard is a little too short to stop spray from coming out under splash guard and back up onto their pants when used on an adult toilet, and if bag liner isn't on just right - and definitely if you try without any liner.  The reusable liner has saved us lots of trouble and made this a good park/travel potty.  Second Caution is that you have to really make sure to click the legs into place just right or it collapses and pinches small fingers when set up as stand-alone travel potty.  Even after reading directions and thinking I was doing it correctly, it took a friend with the same potty to show me how to really get the legs all the way clicked into place before we stopped having trouble.  We now love it for taking out and about as a small potty.
B0016KV73W I keep this thing in my car, and make sure I take it on every trip. Because as you know, as soon as you leave the gas station....somebody has to go potty right there and then!!! I like that the legs fold, it doesn't take up space! and then you tie the bags and you throw them away! Super clean!
B0016KV73W fantastic product! I recently brought it along to our 2 week trip to China. It was so handy I cant say enough good things about it! Product works perfectly and so convenient. In the hotel room it works perfectly as the toilet seat. When we were out, I have had to use the bag a couple of times when my son had to poo and pee. Toilets were hard to find, CLEAN toilets were very rare, so needless to say, it was a lifesaver! It was however kind of short for my 4 year old son. Even when set up, it was quite short and he was a little uncomfortable but he just had to do his thing and he was off. Still a 5 star for me. If they would make it a little more comfy for the little one would be amazing. Highly recommended for parents with toilet going kids!
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to use with the liners and to have in your car. But when put on a toilet it is a very large opening and no splash guard and not very comfortable. Since the opening is wide, it was difficult for my 2year old to sit for any long period of time. We took it on our vacation but probably won't be doing that again. It's going to live in my car and used for roadtrips and emergencies. On vacation I'd still take another more comfy seat that will stay in the hotel or the fold up kind to use in my diaper bag. The liners are great tho!! Nothing else out there like this seat plus liners.
B0016KV73W I wanted to love this potty. I read all of the reviews and was so impressed by how many people raved about it. I think it would work great for a young two year old. However, I bought this when my son had just turned three. My son is very slim at only 50th percentile for weight yet he complains that the potty is too small and uncomfortable to use. He also complains that it is too low to the ground and he feels like he will fall off of it. So, this travel potty is going in storage until my daughter turns two, when I will try it out on her.I do like the design of the potty. It is very compact and folds up nicely to fit in a diaper bag for easy travel. I did find the legs to be a bit tricky to get to pop out (to set up the seat for use) and back in (for storage). I havent used the potty that much though so maybe with increased use I will get better at popping the legs of the potty in and out.I also have to pass on a trick that has worked well for us when we are away from a toilet with my 3 year old son. If you take a large sized zip loc bag and let him pee in there it works rather well. You just seal it up or pour it out and dispose of it. Obviously, this only works well 1) for a boy and 2) for peeing only.So, in sum, because it is so small and low to the ground be mindful of this if you are buying it for a 3 year old or for a larger sized two year old. And even if your child fits on the seat, if they are used to sitting higher up on other potty chairs, such as the bjorn potty, they may feel awkward or like they are going to fall off when they sit on this low to the ground seat and they may refuse to use it. From my experience with this travel potty thus far, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but since I have it I am going to hang onto it and give it another try when my daughter turns two.
B0016KV73W Potty training is not an easy process. This 2 in 1 potty/seat helps a lot with the process. I take it everywhere with me. I mostly use it as a seat but there were a few times where I used it as a potty and it worked perfect (During a picnic, in the car once when parked..)The bags are expensive but I bought them anyway. You never know when you will need them. It's been a year and I still plenty of them left just because I use this product as a seat more often then a potty (As a potty in emergencies or places with no restrooms or with really filthy ones!!)Great buy :))
B0016KV73W My 3 year old is very afraid of going to a loud public bathroom. This has come in handy every time we go out. I do t buy the bags and found if I just use a plastic bag (like target thick bags) with some paper towels it works perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone with a toddler
B0016KV73W we are about a week into potty training and so far this is my son's preferred potty seat.  we also have a little frog potty and a seat that sits on a regular toilet, but I guess this is the one he finds most comfortable.  I bought the reusable liner and I definitely recommend it if you plan on using this seat as more than just a travel toilet.Cons: I haven't tried using this as a travel option yet.  It seems like it would be kind of difficult at first, as it takes a minute to set up, too long for a newly trained child in my opinion.  I'm not thrilled with it as a seat on a regular toilet.  My son kind of sinks into it and the hard plastic leaves red marks.  Also, it doesn't work with a potty hook and we only have one small bathroom so I need something that saves space.Overall, if my son likes it then it's a winner and I like that it has three functions.btw grocery store plastic bags work well too
B0016KV73W Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.
B0016KV73W This portable potty is wonderful -- it fits on every toilet we've tried (very old, small, round toilets can be a bit of an issue, but then you can fit it on the bowl instead of on the seat and it still works just fine), and it works as a portable stand-alone potty as well. It folds up small enough that it isn't annoying to bring it everywhere -- even on airplanes -- and is very sturdy!And with the high weight limit (96lbs), I have no worries about my son (30lbs at 22mos) outgrowing the seat before he's done potty-training.
B0016KV73W My toddler trained early (22 months) and is a little on the short side. Doing our business while we're out and about has been challenging because pulic toilets are so big. AND, I think not having an option for I'm while we're out was sending him mixed messages. I bought this today and we stopped for lunch- he announced he needed to go and he used it right away- no hesitation. In fact, he was even excited because it was just his size. It's small enough to fit in my bag and I'm going to carry it everywhere. I'm not sure how it will be for bigger kids but for my dude it was perfect.
B0016KV73W We always tell my son to &#34;point down&#34; when he pees, but it still will spray out of this. There is a gap between the set cover and the actual seat so I wish it would go down further to prevent sprays. Overall it is a decent product and good for quick trips to the potty, and taking in public.
B0016KV73W My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.
B0016KV73W This was a potty training piece of awesomeness. Flexible for traveling, and easy for our 20 month old to sit on. During her 3 day potty training weekend we kept this handy, carrying from room to room, for &#34;pit stops.&#34; It saved our floors from a lot of extra scrubbing. I call it our porta-potty as it goes everywhere with us for potty time emergencies (we've used it by the side of the road, in a park, in the back of our SUV...) and also as her toilet ring seat in public restrooms. It folds up and fits in its own carrying bag along with a spare set of training pants and small pack of flushable wipes. That kit in turn fits in my tote bag or beneath the stroller. Regular grocery bags work fine, just make sure they don't have any little holes in them!
B0016KV73W I was skeptical about this one but, as soon as the UPS man delivered it my 2  year old boy wanted to go on it.  I let him go 1 time inside but, told him after that it was an outside only potty.  We have used it at least 6 times in 2 days and I'm mostly very pleased with it.  Setup is very easy (just make sure you hear the click when locking the legs in place) but, the built in deflector is somewhat small.  Until he learns to \"hold it down\" we are going to have to take off his pants and training pants so his legs sit wide enough that \"it\" points down automatically (you Mothers of boys know what I'm talking about).  Also unlocking/folding the legs was a little hard the first couple of times but, it seams to get easier every time.  I looked at a couple different portable potty chairs before deciding on this one.  The other 2 options were both bulky and 1 didn't have a deflector and the other sealed so you had to carry the \"waste\" home and clean it out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this seat.
B0016KV73W This is the best $10 I have ever spent!One week after my son turned 2, he decided that he was going to use the toilet and no more diapers.  While I applauded his desire and determination, I had a feeling the &#34;ability&#34; might take a bit of time to perfect.  So, after seeing the &#34;special potties for using on the go&#34; in one of his potty books, I took to Amazon to find out what these on the go potties are.  For $10, I decided to try the potette plus--and have now purchased 3 potette plus-es!These things are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They are little folding 'potties' that can be set up as a small potty OR (bonus!) placed upon a full sized adult toilet seat to make it child sized.  The legs easily snap into place to set the potette up as a potty and easily extend out to use as a child's seat on the adult toilet.  It is the PERFECT size for the &#34;mommy, I have to potty&#34;, as soon as you make your turn onto a busy street--you can easily pull off into the closest parking lot or parking space, set up the potty on the car seat, floor, hatchback, folded down seat, what have you, so that junior can make his pee pee, after telling you for the 5000th time before you left the house 1 minute earlier that he did not have to go.Pros:  Fits perfectly in the diaper bag where we used to keep the changing padEasy to set up and use; for a portable potty, stick in one of the included liners (replacements are available for a reasonable price too--they look like plastic grocery bags with an absorbent pad at the bottom), and prop up the potty for junior to use (we keep it set up in the car--we fold down the front passenger seat and let junior sit on his throne on the folded seat.  It's saved us many a time from an 'unforeseen car seat incident' as grandpa would call it.  Also perfect for bathroom-less parks, the beach, or anyplace else that your little one has to go while &#34;on the go&#34;.  Once junior does his business in the disposable liner, you remove the bag, tie up the handles, toss it in the trash and go about your day.Easy to use on the adult potty.  My little guy was public restroom (or any restroom that was not at home) a-phobic.  He REFUSED to use toilets that were not his own, which made leaving the house while potty training extra fun.  After we got the potette, every toilet seat looks alike! (because the potette is nicely propped on top and that is all the little one sees).The legs/handles keep junior from grabbing those germ infested toilet seats in public restrooms to hold on--he can just hang on to the legs/handles of the potette plus and keep his precious hands free from public toilet yucks.Cons:  We didn't realize that the legs snapped up into the potette to stabilize it when used as a potty.  We learned that after a couple of wobbly attempts.  Make sure that you snap the legs in place when using as a free standing potty.Overall, it has made potty training a breeze.  We never had to spend those long dreaded weekends at home because junior was learning to use the toilet.  We just bring the potette plus with us and he's good to go &#34;on the go&#34;.  We keep 1 in each car and 1 in the diaper bag.  It seems like nothing brings on the urge to potty like getting strapped into the car seat and pulling out of the neighborhood.
B0016KV73W I carried this potty in my purse (it barely fit) while my daughter was potty training. I hardly had to use it, but it was good to have. I carried plastic grocery bags and napkins to put at the bottom of the bag to absorb pee.Negatives:- It takes more than a few seconds to set-up, so if she really needs to go, she might not make it, and you're breaking a sweat.- She has to be okay with sitting down on plastic, because the plastic bag wraps around the seat.- The folding out and collapsing of the legs could improve in designPositives:- portable- pink- can use grocery bags and then throw away immediately
B0016KV73W This seat is perfect.  After looking at all of the travel potty seat options, I chose to buy this seat for my three-year old for our recent road trip.  It couldn't have worked better.  It has fit on every public and home toilet that we have found.  My daughter feels safe on it and really likes it.  She always asks if I have it, even if we are just going out to the park or store.  Plus, she is most comfortable holding on to it while using it, which means her hands stay away from the public potty.We have also used it once in its free-standing mode.  It worked great!  As long as you clip the legs in properly, it is very secure.  Anyone who has had problems with it collapsing must not have had it clicked in right.The only drawback is that you have to buy their bags, if you are going to use it without a toilet.  But their bags are great -- they have a pad for absorbing pee, and are super easy to attach and detach.  When we run out, I will probably try to use regular plastic bags in an attempt to save money, but will probably eventually cave into buying more of their bags because they are so easy and mess-free.  Plus, since it fits on every toilet we've found, I doubt I will use it in its free-standing mode very often.Bottom line -- WELL worth the money.  Great product.
B0016KV73W I love the idea, and while my 3 year is not opposed to using it when we are out it is SO low to the ground.  I have to help him squat down so far and it looks so uncomfortable.  He has missed it comepletely and made huge messes in the back of my car.  I wish the legs could extend somehow.  Great for smaller kids I guess.
B0016KV73W This product is amazing. It gives me piece of mind that my kids (and I!) will always have where to go. Is true that you gotta make sure that the legs of the potty SNAP securely before your child sits on it (I forgot to do this the very first time and the potty collapsed on one side), so make sure it snaps in place. I attached a picture of how the potty looks on a public toilet. It is sturdy for my 2 year old... even tho I still put some toilet paper on the toilet UNDER my potette just in case LOL. Fits my diaper bag, which is normal size... I love this thing.
B0016KV73W Just got it for my potty training daugther, who usually needs to go like now.  We now take it everywhere.  We liked the bags, but ended doing what I read in a review, which is just using regular bags with paper towel on them and it works like a charm (make sure the bag doesn't have any holes like many of them sometimes do).  It has saved us from having to put our daughter to pee under a tree, having to stop and look for a restaurant or something, and things like that.
B0016KV73W Yeah, it's a great idea.  Now, does it work?  Yes!  When it comes down to it, people are talking about two things about this seat.  ONE, there might be a issue for boys because the ring is on the small side; TWO, PUSH IN THE LEGS for the stand alone position.  My daughter wobbled over the first time; so I checked everyones' comments, and now it's great.  Bottom line, great for the occasional emergency.  We all have been there in the dirty gas station thinking we will burn EVERYTHING when we get home.  Great alternative.
B0016KV73W LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My daughter is sort of leery of new things. So I was prepared to fight for her to use this. Boy was I wrong&#8230; She wanted to replace the potty seat we have in the house with this one that I bought for the car :)It is very sturdy. My daughter is 32lbs and not sure of the stat but very tall for her ago (almost 3 years) and she uses it just fine!
B0016KV73W After using this for a few months in my house for my 3yr 2mo old granddaughter, I put it away to use only for trips to the park, beach etc. and bought anotherArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Varyfor my second bathroom that she uses. Here's why:1. The portability of this product is great for use outside the home. It folds easily and compactly. It also can be used as a standalone toilet when nothing else is available.2. So what's the problem with home use? When the legs are pushed up and locked into place, this just isn't stable on the toilet seat. My granddaughter has complained that sometimes it \"pops up\", which is absolutely true. Unless your child sits perfectly in the center of the seat when sitting down, and also gets up without shifting weight to one side, this seat will indeed pop up. That problem doesn't exist when using this as a standalone potty since the legs are facing down.Bottom line: This is a very handy item for day trips, but not something I recommend as a regular potty seat at home.Update April 28, 2014: I've been taking this along when we go out to different places to eat. It's relatively compact to bring, and since I don't let my granddaughter go into a public bathroom alone (unlike when she uses the bathroom in my house), I just hold it in place so it doesn't pop up when she uses it.
B0016KV73W This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).
B0016KV73W Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.
B0016KV73W Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.
B0016KV73W Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.
B0016KV73W What a great concept and easy to use.  I have a potty training 3-year-old and a long commute each day.  My daughter goes to daycare in my office building, so unfortunately she must endure the 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes she can't make it until we get to our destination, so having this travel potty stashed in the back of the SUV has been a lifesaver.  Not only does she think it's fun to use, but even if I don't have easy access to a trash can, the liners do an excellent job on containing the urine until I can safely throw the bag away.  Some people have suggested the use of plastic grocery bags instead of buying the liners.  Unfortunately, I find grocery bags often have small unseen holes in them and do not have the wonderful absorbent pad inside.  Spend the few extra dollars to get the liners that are intended to be used with the potty - you will thank me later!  I also like the fact that the potty comes in a nice storage bag - it keeps it clean while sitting in the back of the SUV and is a great place to store the extra liners.  We don't go anywhere without this potty.  No matter how hard you try to get your toddler to use the potty before you leave somewhere that has a toilet, we all know that it will be only 5-10 minutes later when they actually decide they have to go.
B0016KV73W I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.  I LOVE this little seat.  It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!  For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.  This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a \"dollar\" store).  You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.  One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.  Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.  This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.  The \"carry bag\" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.  I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.  The seat can fit either direction.  The only \"negatives\" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).  If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).  This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.  We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.  I use the same 4 gallon bags.  This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for \"urine pads\" and bags.  The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.  The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.  Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.
B0016KV73W I bought this to potty train my daughter before she turned two. Because I was able to be consistent even when we were away from home, she was daytime potty trained in 3 weeks. We liked this so much that we keep one in the car at all times, ready to go, for those really inconvenient \"Potty-potty!\" calls on the road. We travel with this one also. Imagine a full restroom in Disneyland and not having to wait for a stall because you have this. If I had to wait for a stall, we would have had a mess to clean up. I just put down some paper towels on the ground in a corner of the restroom, pull out the Potette, let her sit on it to do her thing. There was some mommy-envy from moms in line for a stall. They asked me where I got it. My 21month old son is nearly daytime potty trained after two weeks. I must say that this is best for 18-24month olds because of its height. For boys especially, one has to be very careful to aim downward or a stream of urine could easily arch up & out.Buy this and you will not regret it when your little one is in big kid underwear and you can be fearless about getting to the potty \"in time\"!
B0016KV73W Once my son was potty trained in the house and we started to go on outings without pull-ups, I knew we were going to need to have an easy-access potty in the car  I actually traveled with the bijorn potty a few times (not a great idea.)  One day I saw a mom friend pull out a Potette for her daughter during a stroller workout at the park.  It was so compact and easy, I knew I had to get one.  So far it hasn't failed me (except the first time I used it without reading the instructions first and didn't \"click\" the legs in place and it collapsed as soon as my son sat on it.  Whoops...user error...)We've used this for long road trips, birthday parties hosted at parks where the bathrooms were far away or just plain filthy dirty, going on a hike, and at the beach.  It lives in our car, tucked in it's baggy, and behind a box of Kleenex.  I seriously don't know why anyone with young children wouldn't have one of these!***Seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from those who failed to lock the legs into the seat.  This takes a little finesse:  You need quite a bit of pressure to pop the legs in, and just the right amount of pressure to \"unlock\" and fold back in.  If you pull too hard, the legs just come detached. Best advice is to practice set-up and take-down a few times before needing to use it.***
B0016KV73W You can't beat the price for this Use-it-anywhere product!  Seriously... I am a first-time and one-time Mom to a beautiful little girl.  I also get squeamish/freaked-out with the thought of her using public bathrooms and the porta-john at the local park.  I'm not a full fledged germaphobe, but the thought of her sitting and holding onto these toilets is beyond gross!This product can be used as a potty seat over any toilet we've encountered AND... here's the best part:  this potty seat can also stand alone and be used as a portable potty chair with a fantastic bag-insert with a biodegradable gel pack to absorb urine.  I've used this for sudden announcements from the back seat declaring, &#34;I gotta make potty right now Mommy!&#34;  We pulled off the highway and found a safe spot to park the car (an office park with lots of trees and a few sparsely parked cars), I assembled the potty chair within seconds and Her Nibs was doing her &#34;business&#34; with comfort and a bit of pride (early in potty training).  We've used it as a stand alone, at the park, and the beach.  just set it up and sit her down... a little blanket or towel for privacy is a nice courtesy for everyone involved as well.  When she's finished we do a quick wipe, up with the pull-up, and I simply tie the bag handles in a knot and toss in the trash.  It's that easy.  I am now going to give this potty seat as a baby shower gift in the future (there are neutral colors).BOTTOM LINE:  Best value for the multiple-setting-use and money.  Super Easy to use.  Sturdy and Safe.  Portable:  fits in my back pack and diaper bag and comes with a plastic drawstring storage bag for hygienic storage.  A must-have item for parents and kiddos who are potty training and are on the go.
B0016KV73W I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.
B0016KV73W If you want to go anywhere for more than 30 minutes when potty training, you need something like this.  The things I didn't like about this particular device:  it is too low to the ground and the seat is small, the feet don't stay put unless you snap them in which isn't easy to do (my daughter tipped over twice before I realized how to do it), it requires buying refill bags, I'm not sure we're inserting the bags correctly, and it isn't clear which direction the kids should sit.  While small, it is too big for our older model Valco stroller basket so we have to hang it from the handlebar.  I may try another kind of travel potty, but until then we'll continue to take this on walks and in the car.  It gets the job done.
B0016KV73W While potty training is one of the least enjoyable experiences of toddlerdom, this potty is a great addition to the process.  We purchased 3 different ones and she uses this one the most.  We use it at home on our regular toilet with a step stool and when we travel.  It's sturdy, light, and obvious portable and works really well.  Out little almost always chooses this one over the other two we have.
B0016KV73W **Edit. I lost it in a public bathroom and I'm more heartbroken than I should be. I loved this toilet. It made life easy. Mess free.I went and purchased some... crappy kushie folding toilet seat cover and... I hate it. It's nothing like this one.I know it's just a potty, but I really miss it.I think it only adds to my review that I miss this thing so much. It fit 99.9% of every toilet I ran into, minus one that it was a tad too big for.. but the rubber grips still held it on there.There isn't another potty out there like this one and the sooner I get a replacement [it's been two months. -sigh.-] The better.-SIIIGH.-**I didn't buy mine from Amazon because I was too cheap to pay shipping so I found mine on Craigslist instead. Why these parents didn't like this seat I have NO clue!! It's amazing. I bought 10 bags from an ebay seller for 9 bucks thinking I was buying the potty seat before I found it on Craigslist. Got an e-mail a few days later saying they'd accidentally sent me 90. Oh no, what is a girl to do? Now I have a ton of lined bags which is GREAT for when we're out. Parks, deserted parts of the mall if we're a long walk away from a bathroom. I just love it. I threaten my mum and my son's father about ever losing it and what I'll do to both of them if either of them leaves it somewhere. x3 so far they've been very careful.I would recommend this for any parent who's starting their child on the road to potty training young. The bonuses of this seat are;1. It folds up VERY small. Perfect for in the stroller or over night bag.2. It assembles very, very quickly. Even when getting the bag on which can be a bit loud/annoying to do depending on where you are or what time it is. [3am, I don't want to hear a crinkley bag and taking my son to the regular toilet wakes him up too much. I'll be buying a potty special for my bedroom quickly. One that doesn't depend on bags to be a free standing potty]3. Great for younger children just starting to potty train. The hole itself iiiis a bit small, I admit. Nothing to little for my 1.5 year old. I started him on the potty at 14 months and found I was never making it to the bathroom in time when we were out. This has helped me calm down and know that even if I can't find a bathroom I can pull this baby out, pop a bag in and not need to worry about changing a diaper.=D \"this is definately a buy.\" - Fruit Gushers review kid.
B0016KV73W We have only had this little potty for a short while, and it has been a lifesaver, and so easy to use. You DO have to push the legs up into the seat until it clicks when you have it in \"seat\" position, not seat-topper position, to get it to be sturdy. There are no instructions on the package, so other reviews are the only reason I know this. Once set up, it is very stable, although short. But the shortness is what makes it so compact and easy to travel with, which is just fine with me. Of course, the ring is small, but I have a 2 year old the size of a three year old and she fits great. The vinyl bag it comes in it very handy to keep it contained when not in use. Some people have said they throw in in their purse, but it really is way too big to fit in a normal-sized diaper bag if you want anything else to fit in there. The vinyl bag is large enough to leave extra bags and wipes in there. The potty fits regular sized grocery sacks, so you can just put one of those on with a paper towel in the bottom and save a ton of money on the overpriced refills. I love this little potty- don't hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence about it!!
B0016KZZG2 This item works great, doesn't leak, semi-hard-to-clean, but still ok. The only real problem I have with this is not the product itself, its the fact that my son LOVES to squeeze the water bottle so the water spouts out way up in the air and then all over everything. If your child doesn't do that, I'd say yes, buy it. But beware the squeezer!! Not a good fit with that one! :)
B0016KZZG2 I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them. They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so. I wish I got other toppers instead.
B0016KZZG2 This is a good spill proof top as long as the one using it doesn't squeeze the bottle. It does leak if the bottle is squeezed. I wouldn't recommend for use with anything but water, because water doesn't stain.
B0016KZZG2 Air gets trapped and the bottle caves in. Would not recommend these. Good concept but doesn't really work well.  Waste of money.
B0016KZZG2 These are great for babies and toddlers. My twins love water. So I send them to preschool with mini water bottles & these lids. (plus my one year old can use them too) The teachers send them home with the twins at the end of the day. All my friends love them when they come to visit because their kids won't make a mess in the house when running around with their drink. I would suggest it to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q So worth the buy - super soft, great quality and washes well... get two so you always have one on hand! Again 'Carters rocks'!
B0016LVB4Q Nothing wrong with the product itself, but after purchasing and using for a couple weeks with my newborn, I realized that changing pad covers are NOT worth the trouble (and someone please tell me why I thought brown would be an appropriate color... It hides the poo?). After throwing one away because it simply wasn't salvageable, the second one was neatly folded in a closet where, 10 months later, it remains.
B0016LVB4Q Durable cover--it's held up well with multiple washings so far (3 months) and stains come out well (using Bac-Out and sometimes OxiClean). Currently using it over an IKEA blow-up changing pad, so it's a generous fit; but it fits our other change pad. The cute \"bumps\" on the fabric are going away on the area that gets the most wear--the side where my baby's bottom/back lay while changing--which is disappointing. Doesn't look as nice now, so I give it only 4 stars.
B0016LVB4Q So So So SOFT!!! Love this item so much, i purchased another one! Great quality and my little boy seems to like the softness.
B0016LVB4Q I absolutely love this changing pad cover. It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable. I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed. Definitely worth the money.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover. its very soft and is easy to get on and off the changing pad. only problem is that sometimes while changing my daughter she likes to pee and this doesn't absorb any moisture and it runs off onto the floor.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this for my son's changing pad.  We had some ugly yellow ones we got at a consignment sale so I was ready to get something that went with his decor a little bit more.This is perfect!  It washes up soft and didn't come apart.  The bumps give texture for him to feel while I am changing him.  You really can't go wrong with this cover!
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this is! The color is great, the bumps really aren't a problem and it is easy to put on and take off.
B0016LVB4Q I love these covers so much that I bought 3 of them - they will get spit up on and peed on so be sure to have at least 1 extra to put on when the other is being washed. I got 3 for this purpose. They are SO soft and add a great touch of texture and color to the room.
B0016LVB4Q So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.
B0016LVB4Q love this changing pad cover. decided to buy the carters brand after purchasing a major retail store brand cover, which was not soft at all. carters is the best for all things baby. love it, baby loves it too. its not rough on her skin, for when she rolls to the side as i change her. i would def. recommend , and would guy again.
B0016LVB4Q We've been using this pad (in Ecru) for nearly a year and it's held up really well. It's soft and the ecru is a nice color that seems to wash pretty well. I always keep it covered with one of theseCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecrupads on top of it. Makes messes very easy to clean up. I also got a similar BOPPY cover in sage. I prefer the Carter's Ecru one though.
B0016LVB4Q Changing pad cover is great.  We have 2 so we can wash one and have one on the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love the softness of this cover. Nothing much else to say since it's all in the description, but I'd definitely buy again. And of course I'd buy at amazon a million times over babies-r-us; they are such a rip off. Free shipping with prime and no tax with amazon, you can't beat that!Also, fits mySimmons Kids Contour Dressing Table Pad with Non-Skid Bottomand any other standard changing pad. Just don't buy that changing pad for the non-skid (because there is no non skid!!!!)
B0016LVB4Q The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!
B0016LVB4Q This fits well over the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad that we ordered, and is really nice and soft without being too plush. I haven't washed it a lot, but seems like the quality will hold up through multiple washings. The color was a nice neutral, not too pink or yellow as some Ecrus tend to get. Good product for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have this in fuschia too.  It's so soft, really nice to put your baby on.  The chocolate is a deep, rich color which has not faded with washing (I was this in cold with our dark clothes).  It looks nice and serves its function.  I'd love one in lime green, Carter's {:-)
B0016LVB4Q So soft and fits the changing pad well, even has cut outs for the changing pad straps. Only wish I would have got more than one.
B0016LVB4Q Another quality product from Carter's. These hold up well in the wash, and are super soft. They fit all standard changing pads very well. I would also suggest using a changing pad liner over this cover - so if your baby has a blow-out you are cleaning up, you don't have to change this cover every time!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and washes really well.  We have three of these and wash them all the time and after 9 months they still look new and actually seem even softer (and they were soft to begin with).  We have it in off white.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best changing pad ever. It is super soft and durable. Easy to wash and holds up great. Haven't had any problems with it so far.
B0016LVB4Q great quality, great color.  no complaints on this one!  I like the velour type covers for changing table over other stuff.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover; it fits perfectly and snugly, it looks nice, and it is really, really soft (and it's brown, so it does hide stains.  Unfortunately, I would also say that this is one of the least useful baby-related purchases I made - I never use it.  I did use it at first, but it got pooped and peed on constantly and I quickly realized that it was stupid to cover up the plastic, wipe-able changing pad with something I needed to wash every time.
B0016LVB4Q This showed up exactly as I expected and as pictured.  It is soft and durable.  I would definitely reccomend this item to other moms.
B0016LVB4Q Very happy with the cover! It looks great in the room and it is just so darn soft!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is soft, durable, and fits the changing pad great! If it's anything like Carter's sheets, it's going to hold up for a LONG time as well! Great product. Very happy!
B0016LVB4Q I have no complaints about this cover. It fits well and is soft. There is really nothing special about it. I might like it better if it didn't get soaked so easily.
B0016LVB4Q I am pleasantly suprised by this purchase.  The cover is very soft for the baby and (possibly more important) not cheesy looking like many others I've seen.  It blends right in with our decor.
B0016LVB4Q I agree with the other reviewers:  this is a superb cover in terms of softness, fit, quality, etc.  However, if you are on the fence about what kind of changing pad cover to get, hold off.  Ours spends more time in the washing machine because of spit up and other wonders of baby changing, so we end up using receiving blankets and cloth diapers over our changing pad a lot of the time.  If you have the money, get two.  If you would rather save some money, this is one of those items that you can scratch off of your list.  I love this particular cover, just not the impracticality of covers in general.
B0016LVB4Q Super SoftEasy to care forDoesn't shrinkNice Calm sage color (goes well in our nursery)Hasn't changed over time and I've washed mine enough timesI only bought one and it's been fine.
B0016LVB4Q I purchased this cover in Chocolate for a Serta changing pad. It is so soft, my baby loves to be put down on it. She gets all smiley and just loves the feeling. The elasticized edges fit the Serta pad perfectly. I decided to buy a back up cover in Sage and was very pleased at how the cover didn't stain. I was afraid with a lighter color that spit up and accidents might leave stains but my worries were unfounded. Great cover, I'll probably buy another soon!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so ridiculously soft, I love it!!!  The chocolate color looks slightly washed out, but I love the way it feels!!!  I am definitely buying a couple more to keep on hand so that I will always have a clean one handy, but decided to go with the baby blue color.  I am thinking that my espresso colored baby furniture may have something to do with my not liking the chocolate color. . . it's all too dark.  I know baby will be so comfy during his diaper changes.  Also fits our infant summer contoured changing pad perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B0016LVB4Q We couldn't ask for anything softer. This is an excellent changing pad cover and it holds up very well wash after wash.
B0016LVB4Q I have had these covers for over a year, and I still love them.Pros:They are soft.They match the jungle theme in my baby's nurseryThey do not show a single stain after over a year of useThey wash and dry very well. No pilling and still very soft.They are affordable.Cons:They are not organic.Overall, I am super pleased with this purchase and it is one of the few items I bought for the nursery I would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this cover to use with the  Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad, also purchased on Amazon.  I was very impressed with both products being decent value and high quality.  This is the softest material changing pad and is soo adorable to add to our nursery.  Glad I found this!
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.
B0016LVB4Q It is a perfect fit, just like people were saying in the other reviews. I actually ordered two so we have an extra.
B0016LVB4Q I love the fabric and how soft it feels, just right for a baby. I haven't had my baby yet so I don't know how will it turn out to be after several washes, although my mom just washed it for the first use and nothing happened to the fabric yet. Hope its a good buy so that I can buy more of these things in future. I think amazon has the best price too, so thanks :)
B0016LVB4Q Love these changing pad covers! I had one of these, and one of another brand. I liked this one so much, I went and bought a second, and discarded the other one I had. They're cute, soft, and have held up great so far. We have a contour pad with 3 raised sides, and they fit perfectly. My son is 10 months old, and we've used these covers since birth.
B0016LVB4Q As it says this product is very soft.  Went on very easily and looks great in the nursery, happy with my purchase.
B0016LVB4Q We've used this cover 6 1/2 months.  So glad we spent the extra few dollars for this nicer-looking cover.  It's color looks like the picture, it's durable--have washed it half a dozen times.  We use a waterproof pad liner on top of it, but it seems it would hold up well regardless.  We have the Diaper Genie changing pad and its wide straps do not fit through the strap holes in this cover.  Also, the holes are so near the cover's edge that the holes are underneath the pad.  And the Diaper Genie straps come out the side of the pad.  So we just ended up not using the holes.  Eventually I'll get around to sewing a new hole where it should be for our pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love this cover...so I bought two more to keep on hand.  It is so soft and fits my pad nicely.  Highly recommend, especially ove regular cotton covers.
B0016LVB4Q These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...
B0016LVB4Q We love love this! super soft, easy to wash & come on brown is perfect. Bought 2 but I think I'm going to get a third
B0016LVB4Q We are pleased with this product, though it is quite expensive, if I must say so. I think it's going to work out nicely with our changing pad. We got a large, 4-sided changing pad, and it fits pretty well. I mean, it doesn't hug it like a glove, but we are okay with that. It is going to provide the function that it was designed for quite nicely. I would probably not recommend this for smaller changing pads, as it may be too loose on them. I can see a baby grabbing on and pulling it right off in the middle of a changing, which might spell a messy disaster...
B0016LVB4Q THe cover is soft, easy to clean and has lasted two years and is still going strong with baby number two!
B0016LVB4Q Love this, own it in a variety of colors. These are SO soft, look great in the nurery, and still look and feel wonderful after many washes. They fit my long changing pad quite nicely. You can find cheaper pads, but to me this is worth the price, I feel it is very comfortable for my baby and it's holding up nicely.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is great. it is soft and plush. it goes great with the colors of our nursery. its chocolate color that you see in the picture is true to the color that it really is. you should always have 2 covers and i would order two of this cover in a heartbeat.
B0016LVB4Q We love this changing pad cover. We got 2. It is so plush and comfy for baby. Very soft and makes the room look nice. Looks much more expensive than others on the market. I have zero complaints and would absolutely buy this again. I've washed it over and over the last 5 months and no signs of wear.
B0016LVB4Q The pink cover was very close to the color pictured. I has remained baby soft even after repeated washing and air drying. I also purchased the same cover in off white at a local store and they both are holding up extremely well. Extremely pleased with this product!
B0016LVB4Q i will not return because its a bit of a hassle, this looks nice its a very pale pink!the fabric feels a bit thin, not sure how long it will last...worth the money tho if u don't want to spend a whole lot
B0016LVB4Q We have 3 of these in different colors/styles.  Like some other reviewers, we also use the keep-me-dry lap pads on top of the changing cover to catch accidents.  Have washed these many times and they still look great - very easy to care for and a reasonable price.  They are also super, super soft, which we love for our Little One.
B0016LVB4Q All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a \"fluke.\"  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft!  It's comfortable for the baby and is nice looking.  This pad holds up extremely well in the washing machine.  The material seems to be of high quality and like it will last for some time.  I will say if you get some stains on it get to them quickly because they will set into this pad.
B0016LVB4Q Pros:-Soft... in fact, still as soft as the day we opened it and it has been through the washer/dryer 8 times now!-It does not hold a stain! We bought this in the Ecru, and it has been covered in bright yellow baby poop about 4 times now, and each time it comes out of the washer as clean and stain-less as can be! I was sure we ruined it after the first \"explosive baby poop\" fiasco, but it does not have a SINGLE stain on it.-It still looks brand new and like I said, it has been through the wash 8 times! Normally fuzzy fabrics like this don't hold up in the washer/dryer.
B0016LVB4Q These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad is super soft but it stained so easily! Every time it got a little bit of diaper cream on it, the spot of diaper cream turned gray in the wash. After a few months it looked so terrible that I threw it out. I bought a yellow one and the same thing happened. My son is 10 months old and very squirmy so it's nearly impossible to prevent diaper cream from getting on the changing pad. I have 2 terry cloth changing pad covers (1 white, 1 blue) that do not get the same gray stains. I definitely recommend terry cloth over this material.ProsGood Size And FitNice PatternSoftConsStains Easily
B0016LVB4Q I did not think I was going to like this and only bought it because it was recommended to go with the changing pad I bought. But I was pleasantly surprised at how soft it is. Looks good and feels well made. Have not washed it as yet but I hope the color does not fade.
B0016LVB4Q I love these- soft, well made, pretty sage color.  I bought two with our first child.  Bought a third with our second.  Two would probably do, as I use the changing table less- and the living room floor more!  But, don't mind, as these are great.  Durable, too, with all the washing, and will be able to pass long to my sister when she has kids.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and has a nice snug fit over the changing pad. If this is your first child, make sure you have three changing pad covers. We started with two, but I quickly found that three made things easier and I didn't feel like I was always having to do a load of laundry because the changing pad covers were dirty.
B0016LVB4Q This was a great product at a great price. I like how it is less bulky than the fleece ones sold at Target so it is easy to store. It is soft and has held up well in the 7 months we've used it.
B0016LVB4Q This is a very nice changing pad cover. It's soft, pretty colored, and thick and luxurious feeling. My only word of advice is to check out the harder-to-find on Amazon Carter's giraffe printed one before buying this one. We got both to have a spare, but really only needed one. The giraffe one is truly awesome.
B0016LVB4Q I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B0016M10C8 I got these so my son wouldn't have his bare back on the cold plastic changing pad when we change him. My changing pad doesn't have a belt, so the slits are useless to me but they don't bother me or get in the way. These are nice and they wash well. We always have one on the pad and if he wets through it then we can quickly swap it out for the second one while the first is washing. I like these much better than the plastic thin Boppy brand ones I got at my baby shower.
B0016M10C8 I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!
B0016M10C8 These pads are of great quality. I gave it 4 stars because its not what i thought it was. i was looking for changing pads only, not changing table pads. I want to put them in my diaper bag to use when we're out and i need to change the  baby. I don't want to use them on the changing table, which is what its intended for.  I will keep them because they are really nice and thick and soft and i can still use them in my diaper bag.
B0016M10C8 I thought these changing pad covers would fit the entire changing pad... but they only cover the flat middle part (on our Graco pack'n play it's the part that is tan in the middle) which is ok, but our little guy is getting bigger and bigger everyday and his entire body doesn't even fit on it (he is only 3 months old). I like using the pad covers because they keep him from laying on the cold changing pad, but with these his feet still hang off. He hasn't seemed to mind, so I give the product a 4 instead of something lower, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't cover the entire changer!
B0016M10C8 I knew before purchasing this item that it was small. I knew that it would only cover the bottom of the pack n play changing pad to offer protection from the hard cold plastic. I have not used them yet as they were a shower gift, but they have washed well and will fit perfectly in the bottom of the changing pad and provide protection which is all I need it to do. My friends who own these say they hold up well and are a must buy.
B0016N3SF4 I like this bath set, it was a cute change from yellow ducks. drawback is the plastic rings deflated days later, but the frogs are durable
B0016N3SF4 My son is still too young to play with these but I love them at bathtime.  I use them to distract him (2.5 mo old) while his dad washes him down.  Not sure how long these will keep his attention but they're so cute.  I was concerned about how long the air would last in the rings but after 1 mo in the tub they are still filled and buoyant.
B0016N3SF4 I play with it as much as a baby does. Very nicely done. Idea of floating rings with frogs on them is just unbelievable. Would recommend for any age.
B0016N7IJ6 We've used these several times when going out to restaurants with the kids. They work really well and keep the kids occupied while we wait for the food. The only thing I don't really like is that if the kids put their food on the placemat, they can sometimes get crayon in their food! But it's either that or they put their food directly on the table, which may or may not be clean. The adhesive stays put during the meal and comes off easily. They're priced well and worth the time to use. I'd recommend them!
B0016N7IJ6 We picked some of these up at Babies R Us and we love them.  My son is now 2 years old but we've been using these since he started eating solid food.  Their biggest advantage is that (unlike Table Toppers) they are meant to color on and they are big.  I also like that they are made of paper and not plastic.Previously we had usedNeat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat 30-Count.  These Classy Kid placemats are much better than the Table Toppers for a number of reasons.These placemate are wonderful because they:-  have adhesive on all four sides of the placemat (Table Topper only has adhesive on top and bottom sides).-  are big and cover a nice size area; pretty much all the area a young toddler can reach from his high chair.-  are made to go over the edge of the table.  So if your kids likes to play with the edge of the table or even tries to chew on the edge of the table these placemats have you covered.-  Best of all these are made to color on.  They come with a pack of triangular crayons.  My son loves to color these.  It has saved us a lot of trouble when food is taking a long time to come out.-  have different settings with either farm animals, or jungle animals, or undersea creatures on them.  It gives you lots to talk about with your toddler and lots to color!We will continue to use these placemats as long as my son continues to eat food off the table.  He's getting better at using a plate but still.  We really have not found anything better than these.  Although they are a bit hard to find you can either buy them online or at Babies R Us.
B0016N7IJ6 If you take your kids to eat out you have to get these placemats! They are the best out there.Pros:They are huge! They cover every part of the table your child will touch including the side of the table!The pictures they have to color are fun and entertain my daughterThey come with crayons! Which is great into its self but not only that they are triangle shaped crayons so they don't roll off the tableThey also are easy to store in my diaper bagCons:The only con is that the bottom part that is supposed to stick on the table is not as sticky as it could be. The rest sticks fine but the bottom one you have to press very firmly to begin with and also during the meal depending on how long we stay we end up pressing two more times but its not that big of a deal because most placemats out there don't even have the option to cover the side of the table. Anyways I highly recommend this product.
B0016N7IJ6 I love these placemats. It's easy to peel off adhesives and stick these to a table. The adhesive sticks fairly well. When very determined my little one can pull up the adhesive, but it actually re-sticks pretty well. I appreciate that these are are disposable and biodegradeable. We don't use these at home, but do use them when eating out to allow our little one to eat off the table without worrying about germs! My older daughter no longer needs these, but sometimes asks to use them to color on, which can be a welcomed distractions. These are one of my favorite kid products!
B0016N7IJ6 This has been one of the few 'convenience' baby items that has really lived up to expectations. They are so easy to keep in the diaper bag (unlike some non-disposable place mats that inevitably get taken out because they take up so much room) and unfold into a nice big rectangle.They are very waterproof - we are always pleased to find that when we peel up the place mat and it doesn't show any signs of falling apart or leaking through. However, even though they may get covered in water and other liquids, we were surprised to find that we were still able to color on them. Even though my son is not yet 16 months, we can keep him entertained for at least a couple of minutes with coloring on the mats and talking about the different animals and plants depicted on them. The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus. Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon. They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them. I will update the review if we get around to it.As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off. Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)Fabulous product!
B0016N7IJ6 They're huge, they glue down on all four sides, the images give me and my daughter something to talk about during lunches out, and they're biodegradable. What more can you ask for?
B0016NHN82 My baby loves this inflatable tub!  When she was able to sit up, we started using it.  She sits more securely in it without sliding all over the whole bathtub. I love how it has a little loop holder on the back side of the tub for hanging. I use a shower curtain hook to hook through the loop holder on the inflatable tub and hang it on the towel rack in my shower. Convenient!  It's sturdy material and has remained inflated with no leaking.  I wish this tub had been available years ago when my other children were babies!  Overall - one of the best essential buys I've made for my baby.
B0016NHN82 Those plastic newborn tubs just won't cut it around the 6 month mark. Filling up a full-sized tub on a nightly basis is a waste of water. The Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub is a perfect in-between. It allows for a deep bathing experience without using much water. It is a tight fit in the bathtub, but not unworkable. Blowing it up is a pain in the neck, but once it is blow up you only need to top it off every so often. I could care less about how it is decorated, so if esthetics is important to you hopefully another review can fill that need. This is a great tub and should be a registry essential.
B0016NHN82 Love this tub. It fits perfectly in my shower stall (since I don't have a bath tub) and my 7 month old LOVES it. The bottom gets kind of slippery so he slips backwards but if you had a foam pad it would work perfectly in the bottom. I have no issues with this at all.
B0016NHN82 I purchased this item to put in our camper.  We only have a shower in there and I needed a way to bathe my child when she was a baby.  We used it from the time she was 4 months old to the time she was 20 months old.  She got too big for it them and was used to being in the shower with me by then.  This tub stored very easily for travel, was easy to clean, easy to fill with water and was easy to drain.  My child loved using this tub.  She had room to play when she was smaller.  Toward the end, she didn't have room for her boats in there with her, but it served the purpose we bought it for.  We will certainly be saving it to use with our next child.
B0016NHN82 I have a 6 month old daughter who can sit up pretty well but still needs some support once in a while. She didn't seem to really enjoy the infant tub anymore because she doesn't like to recline long, and sitting up in her infant tub was kind of awkward for us to bathe her. We had started bathing her in the big tub with one of us in the tub with her, but it was a pain to fill the whole tub (even if it was shallow) every time, and to get in with her. This inflatable tub is the perfect in-between tub for us! It hardly takes any water to fill, but still stays warmer longer than the infant tub because it holds more water. It fits in the big tub with room for us to sit behind them in the tub or on the edge if we wanted without getting wet in the tub with her. It's soft for if she starts to topple over. And it's got a slight texture so it's not just slippery plastic. A bonus for her is that her bath toys can't get too far away from her. =) The one thing is something I had read in another review: because of the width of the walls, about half the water from the tub faucet ends up going down the drain when filling unless you use a cup or something to divert the water into the small tub. I'm currently looking for a faucet extender like thePrince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/PinkorAqueduck Faucet Extender, Aquaextenders that would work for a tub faucet (with a spout cover) instead of a normal sink faucet, but in the meantime, I found that using one of the cups we use to rinse her off does well to divert the water into the tub. Luckily, the tub fills so fast, I'm not sitting there holding the cup for long. =)
B0016NHN82 We love this baby bath! Our daughter is 8 months old and was starting to get too big for the hard plastic baby bath and yet not quite big enough or steady enough to go right into the bathtub, so this inflatable tub is the perfect transition! She absolutely loves it, it is fully enclosed and has a plug in the bottom and a hook that you can hang it up to dry inside the bath with! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
B0016NHN82 We've been using this little tub for the past few months.  My son is now 9 months old and he still fits in it just fine.  I love it mainly because I don't have to worry about his bumping his head against the sides of the bathtub, and because it uses little water, I don't have to fill the whole bath tub with water and it's comfortable for him.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an infant that can sit up.
B0016NHN82 I use this for my 3 month old, we have been traveling a lot so the bulky infant tubs are not an option for us. We use this and it's great b/c it packs up in a suitcase easily and my son can lay in it with a little water. He enjoys it!
B0016NHN82 This is a very durable, high quality tub. I would definitely recommend this fine product as it's worth the price.
B0016NHN82 My 1-yr-old daughter HATED the regular tub when we tried to stop using the plastic infant tub.  Cried through every bath.  We bought this and she loves it.  We inflated it and let her play in it in the kitchen first (no water) and she climbed in and out over and over.  Once she was in the tub and in water, she splashed and played and just loved her bath again.  What a relief!  It's not very slippery on the bottom, either.  She suddenly got up on her hands and feet twice to turn herself around and didn't slip at all.
B0016NHN82 This is fabulous we have bought others in the past and none has lived up to our expectations other than this and I would recommend to anyone we bought for travel and it is so handy !
B0016NHN82 I chose this tub because the reviews said it was non-slip. They were absolutely true!!! My baby is starting to move around a lot and she has never slipped! I'm glad I bought this tub and didn't transition to adult tub from infant tub because she cried a little when i first put her in, but she got used to this tub fast. I don't ever deflate it. Ijust flip it over when done bathing to dry off.
B0016NMIOG We used this on a trip with our 11 month old daughter when we went overseas and it was exceptionally useful. The container is great and keeps things clean when you're traveling. We used these for a while even after our trip was over. At first Amazon or the company that sold it to us--by mistake sent us disposable spoons by accident but after notifying them of the mistake, either amazon or the company that sold the spoons sent us the correct product. Easy as pie and great service. Now that our daughter is 15ish month old she can't really use them anymore since it isn't deep enough to spoon a lot of food, but its ok...we still found these great when she was the appropriate age to use it.
B0016NMIOG Wasn't sure if I'd actually use these, but we find ourselves out and about and randomly stopping at restaurants or eating at friends' houses frequently, so I figured I'd try it.  Have to say, it is GREAT to just keep in the diaper bag and have handy for that.  Our toddler isn't quite old enough to be able to handle standard sized silverware yet, but these are small like the ones he uses at daycare.  Perfect to have at the ready, easy to clean, and the container keeps them clean and makes them easy to find in the diaper bag.  Every time I have whipped these out, I have received comments from friends that they have never seen anything like this and that it's such a great idea.  We originally bought because we'll be travelling to see family w/ no kids, and this will be perfect for that too.  Highly recommended as a diaper bag staple.
B0016NMIOG This travel set is helpful to keep in a diaper bag for a young kid who is just learning to use forks and spoons.  The flatware is a great size for kids' fingers, while the travel case keeps it handy and easy to find.  Then, as your child gets older, the case is the perfect size for a child's toothbrush and travel size toothpaste!
B0016NMIOG We have bought 5-6 different kinds of flatware for our toddler and the Take and Toss is our favorite.  I tend to buy the more expensive product thinking it will be superior.  For once, that is not the case.  The Take and Toss has no sharp metal so toddlers don't poke themselves while learning to maneuver their forks.  They are also the perfect size for a toddler's mouth.  It surprises me how wide some of the other flatware out there is.This travel set is my favorite!  It is on my list of must-have's and I add it to all by baby/shower gifts.  This lives in our diaper bag.  Not only is it handy to have when eating away from home, but it doubles as a toy until the food arrives.  My little guy loves shaking it and taking the utensils out and putting them back in, over and over.  It's small, cleans up easily, and is cheap to replace when a spoon accidentally gets buried under a pile of wet wipes.  Highly recommended!
B0016NMIOG Got these for a recent family vacation. I love that the container keeps them contained - clean or dirty. When we came home these became a staple in our diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I always carry these in my diaper bag when we go out for outings to the park or to eat out, and they come in very handy! The container is compact and holds just enough utensils, and keeps the utensil from soiling other items in your purse after use. The utensils are easy for my toddler to use, and I always wash and reuse them instead of tossing them. Because they are so inexpensive, it's not as much as a loss when I lose one of the utensils (which inevitably happens when you have a toddler). I boughtThe First Years Take & Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Pieceas spare utensils to use at home and replace in the container.
B0016NMIOG I bought this to keep in my diaper bag so I have child size silverware when we go somewhere. I love the case that it has. It beats having them in a plastic bag all the time! I've even pulled it out to entertain my child with. It can be used as a make shift rattle and my son loves to take the top on and off. Overall a great product!
B0016NP0ZA This thing held up GREAT... for like a week then it would never, ever stay stuck to the wall anymore. Which is a shame because the lady bug toy holder looked so cute and neat on the wall... but i refuse to drill holes. I WISH this would work like it says... but my lady bug just sits on the tub floor now after use.
B0016NP0ZA We got the Boon Pod, Ladybug and wanted it above our tub, without having to use adhesive to hang it. This is perfect. Followed the instructions to clean and let dry the surface on which it will hang. Works great.
B0016RSDYG Really beautiful, modern design. I was worried it did not work together with my mattress (nook pure) but it fits nicely. As other reviews pointed out, the paint chips easily. I attached a mobile to one side of the crib and it got damaged, but I would not complain about quality either. Happy with it. Would recommend.
B0016RSDYG I did extensive research into a modern-looking and sturdy crib that won't cost me an arm and a leg. This Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 crib fits the bill. Setup was easy and the whole thing definitely feels solid. Much better than some of those flimsy looking entry lines - including the $200 Ikea cribs.I did also consider the Babyletto Mercer 3 in 1, but ultimately went with the Modo because there is enough clearance under the Modo 3 in 1 for my Roomba to move in and out. With the Mercer, just be aware that the bottom of the drawer almost touches the ground, so you won't be able to either vacuum or sweep the area underneath the crib - and that area ends up becoming a dust landfill.
B0016RSDYG I have had my son sleeping in this crib for over 3 months and am very happy with it.  I put it together by myself in about an hour and a half.  I took my time and moved a little slower knowing it was made of soft wood.  There were a few steps that would have been easier to complete with two people.  The wood is a little soft and I did make one ding in the wood on the inside, but this would have been avoided had I waited for my husband to get home to help.  Very sturdy once assembled.
B0016RSDYG I don't think you can find better quality for the money if you're looking for a modern crib.  Love this crib.  Our daughter's nursery is mid-century modern-ish and this works perfectly in it.
B0016RSDYG My wife and I are having twins and we recently purchased two of these cribs.  We put both together last night and I have to say it was very easy to assemble and seems to be very sturdy.  Probably took us 45 minutes to put each one together at the most.  The materials seem to be very good quality and the crib actually looks better than cribs that are much more expensive.  One thing to note is that both cribs we received already meet the new CPSC standard for full size cribs even though that standard doesn't go into effect until June 28, 2011.  Babyletto (MDB \"Million Dollar Baby is the parent company) were great about responding to my email and confirming that the cribs we had conform to this new standard.  Overall we are extremely happy with this crib.Update:  We have now had our twins for just over two weeks and the cribs seem to be very comfortable for them.  They actually sleep better in the cribs than most other places, i.e. bouncy chairs, etc.  The cribs are solidly built and have worked great with no loose parts or creaks/rattles.  Overall still very satisfied.
B0016RSDYG This crib is beautiful, and I love it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it looks great in our nursery. Amazon really does have it for the best price (I looked everywhere), plus free shipping on such a large item was wonderful. It came undamaged and well packed.
B0016RSDYG I've used this crib for my daughter who is now 7 months and we've had no issues with it what so ever. That being said she's not standing up in it yet so I'm yet to lower the mattress yet. I like the style of the crib and it fit our criteria cause we were looking for a crib that didn't convert into a twin bed cause we didn't care for the look of the head and foot board when used as a crib. Plus you can 'float' this crib in the center of the room which looks great.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib quickly and the packaging was intact.  No dents, bumps, scratches in the crib pieces when we opened the box and everything was packed neatly and efficiently.  I was 5 months pregnant when the box came and I assembled the crib mostly by myself in less than an hour.  Needed my husband to help me hold a few things in place, but only because I'm somewhat clumsy!  Assembly was very easy and I love that the fasteners are placed discreetly so you don't see a bunch of shinly metal screws all over.We love the simple, more modern design of the crib and the finish is beautiful.  Very pleased with the aesthetics.  I did bump into it with the vacuum (I said I was clumsy!) the other day and leave a little ding, but I figure it's furniture for a kids room and it's going to get a little beat up.  I had read reviews that the wood was a little soft and dings easily so I was not surprised to see that my vacuum bump left a mark, but I guess I just expect that any baby/kid furniture is going to get beat up over time so that was really not a huge issue to me.As I write this I am 6 months pregnant, so we have no little one using the crib yet and I cannot review based on usage.  But based on packaging, shipping, assembly, and appearance we are very pleased!
B0016RSDYG I bought this crib for my 2nd baby, who is on the way.  The first time around, I spent WAY too much money on my DS's nursery furniture, buying all the conversion rails (from crib to toddler bed to a full-sized bed), etc.  At the time, it seemed so wise, but honestly, I don't think I want to keep the crib until my son is fully grown and ready for a full-sized bed.  But since we spent so much $ on it, I feel like I have to keep it longer than I would otherwise have wanted.  With the Babyletto Modo, the price is great.  It is very en trend with the espresso and white combination, and I don't feel like I have to keep it for more than a few years.  It is just as sturdy as my son's pricey crib, and seems like it will be durable enough to handle our next child, at least through the toddler bed stage.  I also like that it is low enough for me to be able to put a sleeping child into it even when we eventually will have to lower the mattress.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib.  It's made with solid wood (no toxic particle board) and has a lower profile, which makes it a bit easier to put the baby in when its set to the lowest setting.  It's a no frills crib, which is what we wanted, so it takes up less real estate in my son's nursery.  The wood is quite soft, and we have accidentally dinged the edges with the vacuum, which I am really bummed about.  It set up very easily and is also pretty light, so you can move it around if necessary.  Fits standard crib mattresses.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib! When I was looking for a crib I wanted a white one and a more modern one. I looked at many many cribs and most of my ideal cribs were way out of my price range. I kept coming back to this one, so finally took the plunge and made the purchase and am not disappointed!It came from Amazon in perfect condition. The step up was super easy. The directions were easy to read and follow. My husband put it together in no time at all. It is a bit lightweight, but I didn't expect it to be heavy with the price we paid.This is our first baby so I don't have any experience with other cribs but I am 5'1&#34; and this crib is a great height. I don't imagine having any problems with putting baby in/ getting baby out.
B0016RSDYG Purchased a second one for my second child. Great modern look and doesn't take over the whole room. highly recommend
B0016RSDYG This is a great crib -- streamline, compact, sturdy, strong, etc. We had it as a crib for almost two years and had no problems whatsoever with it.However, when we transferred it to a toddler bed, we found that the side rail doesn't fit in flush. See the pictures and you'll know what I'm talking about. There is a big gap and shows the mattress under the rail. Furthermore, it shows screw holes that are no longer in use. We were extremely disappointed because it looks like a piece of junk now.I would recommend this bed for anyone wanting just a crib. Skip it if your plan is to convert it to the toddler bed with rail. Or even without the rail as you'll still see all the screw holes on the bottom and the mattress will slide.
B0016RSDYG I ordered this through Amazon and it came within 2 days.  My husband and I spent about an hour putting it together.  The instructions were ok, could be better but we figured everything out.  We had enough hardware and there were no damaged pieces.  Whew!  Everything looks really good and sturdy but I haven't officially used it since the baby is not here.  However, the assembly was good and the wood wasn't as cheap as I read in other reviews. I'm happy with it so far and love the color, finish and look.  I ordered the Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress to go with this crib and it fits perfectly!  One of the reasons i picked this crib was because it is geared towards shorter women like myself and the price point was good for me.  I'm still debating on the dresser as I heard really bad reviews.
B0016RSEG8 This is a great portacrib mattress. I bought it because there have been some studies which suggest that SIDS deaths may be related to fire retardant chemicals in infant bedding and the lack of some newborns to process it well. This pad is firesafe through the use of a different, not so chemically laden process. In terms of what buyers said about the pad's thinness, newborns do not need the kind of thick mattresses that adults think of as more comfortable. (In fact, I once heard it put very well: In terms of SIDS safety, \"If the mattress looks like it would be comfortable for you, no newborn should be going anywhere near it!\") The comfort comes in whatever soft, lovely, tight-fitting material you lay over it. I used the chenille sheets by American Baby Company - although for said reasons, I wished I could find something truly organic (not just an organic surface as I saw with some products). I was impressed with the pad - it looks and feels very well made, and I don't know how on earth they got an all-cotton surface to be waterproof, but it feels remarkably impermeable without sacrificing comfort. The pad is very firm, more so than many other baby matress thingies - the other reviewer should have nothing to fear. The only concern I think people should have with the thickness of the mattress is that you need to make sure your sheets - which may be designed with a thicker mattress in mind - don't bunch up and become a crumply surface the baby could slide around in too much. If you run into such a problem, safety pin the corners of the sheet's underside together to make it tighter on top.
B0016RSEG8 I got a replacement for my original one because I felt it was too soft and had too much &#34;give.&#34; My baby is a belly sleeper and she sinks into this to the point that her face looks like it's in the mattress.  The replacement had the same issue.  They indicated it's because I was using in a Graco and the support is not intended for this, but it has the same issue even on a hard floor.  I have their full-size mattress which I absolutely love.  I would only recommend this mattress for babies who are over 6 months of age and are NOT belly sleepers. Then I would think it would be fine. I wish there was a similar option in terms of organic but the only other option is not as natural as this one is.  I felt others should know about this possibility with this  mattress because I feel it is a safety issue.
B0016RSEG8 I own a full-size Naturpedic crib mattress and love it.  It fits tightly in the crib, isn't toxic so there's no issue with off-gassing as with traditional mattresses, is lightweight enough for me to handle it easily, and is rock hard so there is absolutely no question about its safety.  When I needed a portable crib mattress I decided to try Naturpedic, despite the steep price, because I expected the same.  I was somewhat disappointed when the product arrived.  On the positive side, it fits snugly around the edges, leaving no gaps in the portable crib.  Also, it is the firmest portable crib mattress that I could find, and I tried several from Dream on Me, LA Baby, Colgate, and even Mamadoo.  Naturpedic uses the same Air-Core technology as it does in the full-sized crib mattress.  However, the problem lies in the waterproof organic cotton cover which does not fit tightly to the core of the mattress as it does with the full-size mattress.  The cover has a rippling effect and tends to bubble when the baby is placed on it.  I use it with the Grayson portable crib made by Babyletto.  The mattress dimensions match the portable crib dimensions perfectly, so that's not the issue.  The rippling issue caused me a great deal of stress when I received the product because my baby has just started rolling over onto his belly at night and I was concerned that this would create a suffocation hazard.  Because we've been staying in a hotel for a month (our home was majorly damaged and had to be repaired), I was forced to use this mattress as it was the best one that I could find, despite its flaws.  It has caused me many sleepless nights (but no scares).  There isn't a portable crib mattress that I have found that I could wholeheartedly recommend.  I still believe this is the best portable crib mattress out there.  Use this if you absolutely must use a portable crib.  Another tip, only use a tight fitting fitted sheet, preferably NOT one made of jersey, as the jersey sheets tend to stretch and, in my opinion, become a loose bedding suffocation hazard.  Instead, use the Naturpedic organic portable crib sheet or any traditional cotton sheet that matches the dimensions of the mattress, fits tightly, and has all around elastic.  And DON\"T use a mattress pad cover with it as it makes the mattress softer.  If you have the choice, stick with a traditional, full-size mattress in a full-size crib once your baby is rolling over.
B0016RSEG8 After searching for a natural organic bed for our expecting baby, I decided to take a chance on this one after purchasing the Da Vinci Crest 50 Coil mattress which was made with PVC toxic material. Even though the previous mattress fits perfectly with our Da Vinci Mini crib, when it was a sunny day and the nursery got a bit warm, there were obvious fumes coming from the mattress since it's had PVC. I didn't want to chance it so we decided to buy this one. This pad was extremely firm and doesn't have a smell. After placing the same brand mattress pad and sheets on, it was slightly snug for the crib but still works.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress is thin and is firm and I wouldn't want to sleep on it but my baby loves it. It is made of cotton so I can see that some of them may have bunches because sometimes that happens with these organic products. If you were to get one of those, I would exchange it because ours was even throughout the mattress.-Firm and safe, fits in my davinci mini crib tight and perfect-Water proof and easy to wipe off-It is just about all my 2 month old will sleep on (now 13.5 lbs and 24 in long)-Yes it works as a mattress alone, it may seem thin but it may be because we as adults would see it as very uncomfortable
B0016RVLZY I loved this product when I first opened it... no foul odor and it was much more substantial than the mattress that came with my bassinet. After a single usages by my 8lb baby, there was a huge indent which was dissapointing. I've continued to use the mattress, I just rotate it and try to fix the indentations every night!
B0016RVLZY When I purchased a bassinet for my daughter, I did not like the flimsy mattress that came with the bassinet. I began to look for a new mattress for the bassinet and found this. Make sure you measure the bassinet before ordering this item. I did and it fits well. A friend of mine didn't and it doesn't fit her bassinet.After 2 1/2 months of continuous use, the mattress is still holding up well. It is starting to take on my daughter's impression. It would be nice to \"flip it\" to even out the wear and tear on it but it does not appear that that will work. Hence the four stars.The price has gone down since I purchased my bassinet too.All in all this is a good mattress for the price and is a much better option than the standard flimsy mattress that usually comes with a bassinet.
B0016RVLZY We bought the oval bassinet mattress to replace the plastic mattress that came with a cosleeper nest. It's fine, but there's not anything to it and the price is just ridiculous. We have the reversible crib/toddler mattress from the same company and that was something like $250. It's fantastic quality, so it seems ridiculous that this flimsy little mattress that is less than 1/20 the size of the crib mattress is almost $70.She didn't use this much because she wouldn't sleep apart from me very well, but we still had issues with the mattress dipping where she lay on it, even though she was teeny tiny (less than 6 pounds) when she used it.There aren't many options for organic bassinet mattresses, so for that reason alone (if you are like us and insist on organic bedding) it may be worth getting, but the price is still ridiculous.
B0016RVM4O Yes, it seems to be comfy, and I feel better about using this than a plastic/vinyl sheet for all of the obvious reasons. But I don't really consider it waterproof. Fortunately in my daughter's first year we've had very few leakage problems at night, but the first time her diaper did fail her, I removed her sheet only to discover this \"waterproof\" pad was wet through. There wasn't a huge leak, either, my daughter's cloth diaper had just slipped out above its cover and wicked moisture up, through her jammies, and onto the sheet. But the pad still did not prevent the mattress from getting wet. Maybe it helps for minor things, drool and whatnot simply by providing bulk between sheet and mattress, but I wouldn't count on it for anything major. Really wish I had better things to say about it.
B0016RVM4O This is a great crib protector pad. (Pee pad)  It is flat which makes it easier to change.  The materials are also healthier than any other waterproof crib pad I have found.  I have a non-waterproof crib mattress so just in case, I have the fitted one and then this flat one on top of that.  I keep the fitted one on at all times and I only change the flat one.  I have 2 flat ones, one to use and one to wash.  We haven't had any leaks so the fitted one is still clean.  It does take a while to dry but that doesn't bother me.  I just put it on low heat and set my dryer for 50 minutes.  A longer drying time is well worth the benefits of having healthier bedding materials. Use low heat to make sure you don't damage the waterproof membrane.
B0016RVM4O We received the item, but the item itself does not seem waterproof. The underside does not seem to have any type of sealed backing and it looks that any type of liquid would nonetheless seep through the pad.I wouldn't recommend it.
B0016RVM4O I bought this to put over our Naturepedic Lightweight Classic 2 Stage mattress for extra protection. It seems like it's made of heavy duty canvas so am sure it will hold up to any messes. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (vs. 5 for all our other Naturepedic items - crib mattress, changing pad, cradle mattress) is because this is probably overkill if you have a naturepedic mattress already.  It's very thick and I got this instead of the FITTED crib pad because those reviews made it seem like the fitted pad took a long time to dry.  Either way, it's still great quality and would be great if you don't have a waterproof mattress to begin with.
B0016RVM4O Need to return it as it is -way- bigger than its size and we cant fit it on the crib without it bunching and causing a hazard. Just measured it - it is 31x54.
B0016RVM4O We have not had a severe leak yet so i can't speak to that yet.  but minor leaks and spit up it does great.  the fit is a bit big but when we put the fitted sheet on top we dont have any issues.  would definitely recommend this one!
B0016RVM4O I am so glad I purchased two of these crib pads.  I love that they are not fitted and it makes the crib easier to make.  I took another reviewers suggestion and  make the crib with a crib pad, sheet, crib pad and sheet.  This way if an accident occurs in the night, I can just pull off the top set.  It is also good to know that they are breathable and not vinyl.  They wash and dry well too.  I can see these passed along through a lot of babies when I am done with them.
B001708AS6 I bought these for my daughters nursery and they look great. They are a perfect pink! Buy at least two of them (depending on window size maybe more) to get the bunched look.
B001708AS6 I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.
B001708AS6 I wouldn't be surprised if every baby girl room has this! It is the cutest thing in existence. Just barely pink, it looks great with any style...sleek and modern, or antique/vintage. I'm not a fan of pastel, but on this i was sold. it's whimsical, inexpensive and well-made.
B00175ROGU She doesn't pay too much attention to it, but every kid is different I guess.  The product is fine, she just isn't into it.  Which is weird, because they had one at daycare she was totally into which is why I purchased the exact same thing!  But now she's not.  Go figure.
B00175ROGU I give this to my four year old in stressful moments. He doesn't look for it - so no &#34;binky&#34; issues - but I like to have it on hand. This was Christmas vacation so I used it a LOT because he was off-schedule and had a hard time going to sleep. This really helped a lot.
B00175ROGU Durable and fun for my 23m son. He has oral motor issues and suspected SPD and this has been great. We trace the outline of his mouth around his lips which reflexively works his facial muscles, and he loves the nubby texture on his tongue. The only improvements I'd make:*Something to attach it to his shirt safely (he likes to chew shirt buttons and sleeves)*I wish it weren't hollow. This is often used as a whistle, and his drool comes shooting out the hollow end, which is pretty gross.
B00175ROGU My son has some chewing issues and this product helps him a lot. Instead of chewing on clothes and other items he grabs this. The size is great and he likes the color and texture.
B00175YU7G This has been my baby's very favorite teether. She absolutely loves it! We started using at about 2 1/2-3 months. It's soft and easy for her to hold. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ears are a bit long for a teether. My baby has gagged on them numerous times.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a nice, soft rattle for our baby... but it's the only one we have that she couldn't care less about.  Maybe it's too \"boring\" looking for her?  She'll reach for it when handed to her, but she quickly drops it in search of something else.  Also, I personally wish I had noted it was made in China before purchasing.
B00175YU7G I got this for some friends who are trying to be eco-friendly parents.  They were thrilled with this rattle/teether.  Their little one has really taken to it.  He got it at about 1 1/2 mo and loves chewing on it.  It's easy to wash and is shaped well for tiny hands.  They always bring it whenever they take the baby out somewhere.
B00175YU7G My son liked this teether a lot, especially as an older baby.  I like the soft knit over the firm body which gives more resistance when gnawing on it.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!
B00175YU7G I loved the idea of an organic teether for my son, so I purchased this bear. However, since day one of introducing it to him, he has showed little to no interest in it at all. It is rather stiff and doesn't have the best rattle. He used to suck on the hands occasionally, but now has completely lost interest in this toy altogether. For the price, I would not purchase this again.
B00175YU7G Our baby irl has been teething since she was only 2 months old. She did not like the cold teethers but the hard ones she would bonk her head with so... we tried this one and she loves it! She is now 6 months old and we have to take the bear with us wherever we go!
B00175YU7G At first my son wasn't fond of this teether... he just never liked it. He puts EVERYTHING in his mouth but I give him the one thing I want him to put in his mouth and he refuses it! BUT, after a few months I tried it again and now it seems to work quite well. With teething it's important to have more than one type because baby gets bored with each relatively quickly.
B00175YU7G This company used to be great and then it was bought by a larger company. Says organic but it is made in China and stuffed with polyester. Not too organic if you ask me.
B0017AE3BO The brush does a good job and serves it purpose.  It's nice that it can pump out a little bit of baby shampoo/wash (whatever you put in it) but it requires a lot of pumps and doesn't really lather or anything like that.  It's really more useful to wash a baby's scalp because of the bristles and not really a necessity for infants but nice to h
B0017JB6HY My daughter was less than 5 pounds when she came home from the hospital and this swaddle wrap was the one that fit her best.  It is very easy to get baby in and out of this wrap and it was much more difficult for her to free her arm from this wrap versus the Halo Sleepsack.  She is now 8 lbs and the wrap is a little tight on her already.  There is no way this swaddle would fit a bigger infant - I would recommend getting a bigger size if your baby is 7.5-8 lbs or more.
B0017JB6HY These swaddles are great because they keep the child secure.  When my child got old enough to start rolling over, we stop swaddling the arms and just swaddle around the chest.  It becomes a routine to wrap them up and put them to bed.  My daughter actually smiles when I get the swaddle out, because she knows when it is time to go to sleep.
B0017JB6HY We have 4 of these and they are wonderful!  We swaddle under his arms because I don't like things too close to his head and he pulls his arms out anyway, but these keep him warm and happy!
B0017JB6HY not worth the money for me. I'd rather just wrap my baby in a blanket, like a burrito..she'd get more use out of that anyway. She only used this product about 4x. by the time she was around 2 months old, she was too big for it.
B0017JB6HY it was just ok - either my baby was super strength baby or I just wasn't wrapping her correctly, but she would bust out of it every single time. I did much better with a big swaddling blanket and swaddling her the old school way - i probably only tried to use this a few times and gave up.
B0017LCZEU These are great for creating memories in your home.My wife and I struggled with trying to get our child to put his hand into the print without bending his fingers (trying to grab the clay) but ultimately after trying a few times (rerolling the clay) succeeded. We bought an extra set to produce more so that instead of giving each of them (our set produced 2) to our parents and leaving her with none&#8230; she will now have this precious keepsake as well.Things to keep in mind here&#8230;-clay doesn't dry in 1 o 2 days; ours took probably 5  days and had to be flipped over so that bottom could dry-product cracks slightly depending on how it dries (read instructions carefully)-Ribbon provided is green, yellow and pink so if you have a boy and produce two of these you'll have to use the neutral color as wellGood product.. cost effective for 'imprinting' a moment in the life of your child and yours.
B0017LCZEU So the kit has the ability to make two keepsakes, which is great as it will make Christmas presents for both set of grandparents. Really easy to use. Just have to make sure the clay is soft. Made impressions of my lo's hands then left them out to dry. Once dry, I'll attach the ribbons and wrap for presents. Wonderful idea.Update: they dried really well and truly hard. Both sets of grandparents absolutely loved it and can't wait to display it. So good that I'm buying another set to keep for myself.
B0017LCZEU These did not turn out good at all even after following all the directions. They dried very cracked as opposed to a smooth surface as pictured. I do not recommend.
B0017LCZEU We haven't made these yet... they are going to be Christmas presents for the grandparents. Can't wait to make them with my son! :) (He's 8 weeks)
B0017LCZEU This is another must have, we put her little foot prints up every Christmas, I'm so glad I got this!
B0017LCZEU Used these when my baby was 2 weeks old. Very easy to work with, and they turned out great. Definitely recommend!
B0017LCZEU Finally I found one that worked! It was great. There wasn't a strict time limit so if I wasn't able to get a good print, I just started over again until it was right. It dried in a few days and stayed hard. I would do it again.
B0017LCZEU I loved making keepsakes of my baby's hand and foot. The instructions were clear, and easy to do. There were 3 ribbons to choose from. Pink, blue, and yellow.
B0017LCZEU This kit makes a great Christmas gift or a way to commemorate baby's itsy-bitsy feet and hands for yourself and loved ones. I purchased the keepsake kit for a memento of my son's hands and feet. It contains a sealed package of the molding clay, three ribbons (pink, yellow, and blue), a pointy straw for making a hole, a dinky little roller that's not up to the task of rolling out the clay efficiently, a large round cardboard cutter, and basic instructions on how to create the ornaments.I strongly advise adding parchment paper to the list, not just to protect your countertops or table, but also for allowing the ornaments to dry. The hardening period takes anywhere from 4 to 7 days, and the parchment paper ensured the back of the clay was not exposed, disturbed, or crumbly. Parchment paper also makes for easy transfer.Making an ornament is straightforward. Roll out the clay to desired thickness, fight with your squirmy baby's reflexes to spontaneously curl his toes or contract her precious little hand into a fist, press down gently for an impression while your newborn honks blue murder, and then examine the results. With some luck, you may have a reasonable impression and an infuriated spouse co-opted into this special form of infantile torment. Didn't know that babies generally refuse to spread their fingers and adorable little toes when asked? Well, now you do. My husband decided to roll out the clay again for a second impression, and a third, at my insistence because the ravenous claw marks scratched over the white surface rather resembled an attack by a very tiny, very persistent velociraptor. Not exactly what I had in mind for enshrining my 8-week-old's most precious extremities.Once you do manage to gain an impression - preferably after a bottle of wine, I'll note, but not if you're the nursing mother - then keep it inside the wooden frame for best results. Drying may be a smidge slower, but without risk of cracking or falling apart by some act of circumstance. We used a large round cookie cutter in addition to the cardboard ornament cutter provided; between the two, the metal cookie cutter worked far better for clean edges and punching through the clay. The cardboard was shorter and flimsier.The results are very attractive though. Note for an average sized 2 month old baby, two plaques is all we managed to eke out without some creative positioning.
B0017LCZEU Product worked exactly as the package stated.  I had plenty of clay to make 2 keepsakes and had a little clay left over.  You do have to press firmly on your child's hand to get the imprint but the clay was moist enough that I could try again if I didn't like results the first time.  Since my daughter is only 6 months old, I had enough room on the edges of my keepsakes to add little christmas buttons for some color.  Fun project.
B0017LCZEU I bought this and it was so easy to use!  The only hard part was getting my 7 month old to not move her hand when I was trying to make the imprint, though the foot was no problem. I think it would be smarter if next time I did it with a with a sleeping baby!  I was actually able to get four great ornaments out of this set, though I did not make extremely thick ornaments. I made 4, 1/8 inch thick ornaments,  The clay was very easy to use.  I used a bigger straw than the one given as it was much easier to thread the ribbon through.
B0017LCZEU I really enjoyed making my son's handprint and footprint from this kit. I'm glad it is something I can look at every Christmas.
B0017LCZEU very cute project. We did this with our one month old. It was very hard to do it with a one month old. came out okay. Had to give it a couple of tries. Dried well. Love the ribbons.
B0017LCZEU Our family loved getting these for Christmas!  They were pretty easy to make, although we didn't like the cutters that they provided because they left the edges really ragged.  We just formed our own little circles.  I would use them early on though because our 4-mo-old's feet were nearly too big for the ornament!
B0017LCZEU The kit itself was easy, getting my newborn to unclinch her fist to make the hand print not so much. The kit had everything I needed and I was actually able to make 4 placques!  My only reserve, was it seemed to crack a little bit when it dried.  It's not extremely noticeable, so I only took off one star.  It could have also been user error.  However, right after I bought and made this I saw a recipe for a handprint mold on pinterest with flour and water.  Might try that next time before I buy another kit.
B0017LCZEU I ordered this kit to make tree ornaments of my baby's hand and foot prints for her first Christmas.  They turned out so well!  I'm not sure why the instructions say to roll it out 3/4 inch thick though.  A half inch would be plenty to leave a print and would be less heavy.  My baby was about 10 months when we did these and was able to fit her hand in the circle provided.  I just rolled out the remaining piece free form for her foot.  There was no mess for the baby and they dried in a few days.
B0017LCZEU I don't recommend making 3 keepsakes out of one package but you can split in half and soften half at a time and it's a perfect amount.  I used everything provided in the package and they turned out great.  I made one of baby's hand and one of his foot.  Some of the reviewers were talking about putting a lot of pressure on baby's hand to make a good imprint but I found that to be untrue, i did not have to hurt a baby to make an imprint LOL.  Just make sure you soften it better and it's very soft.
B0017LCZEU It did the job, the only con is it's a bit heavy when dry which only concerns me because I'm using it as Christmas ornament.  I was able to imprint both the hand and foot of my 4 month old baby.
B0017LCZEU Was able to make three keepsakes out of this and it was pretty easy to do!  The hard part was figuring out when to do it since mine are 9 months old and it's hard keeping them still.  I tried to do their feet, but they were far too big now for that, I'd recommend that for a newborn if you're going to do it.  The issue is, they tend to move their hands a lot.  So mine weren't perfect, but really, that in itself was nice to have captured.
B0017NC77I This is very handy and I would not buy a big stroller again.  We went to the Rec center and the elevator was broken so I shrugged my shoulders and pulled my kid out, folded it down, and swung it over my shoulder.  This is definitively a great little stroller and very light.  The only thing I miss is being able to have a small diaper bag hanging on the bar while I pill my kid out.  I know you are not supposed to do that!  This will fall over because the stroller is so light.
B0017NC77I This is a fantastic umbrella stroller.  I picked this over the Maclaren Vollo and am extremely pleased.  A few things I love about it:--The sunshade is huge and can extend almost all the way down over the baby.  Also, a flap in the back protects them from the sun in that direction, while making it easy to peek down and check on them when pushing them.--The place where the straps click together has a little flap that velcros down over it.  Probably not necessary, but a nice feature.--The seat insert comes out VERY easily for washing.--The seat insert in a nice meshy type fabric that seems cool for hot weather.--The seat isn't as deep as the Vollo, meaning that smaller babies can ride in this without slumping over as much.  I know, they tell you to wait for 6 months to use these, but I was able to put my 3.5 month in here no problem because of the way the seat is made, its just more supportive than the Vollo.--Unlike the Vollo, this stroller has a built in stand, so that the stroller stands up when folded!  Wheels don't touch the sunshade or anything, so nothing gets dirty.--The fold is easy, although does require two hands.  The unfold can be done with one hand.
B0017NC77I I got this stroller for a international trip back to the USA with my 2 1/2 year old.  I needed a light umbrella stroller but didn't want to give up and get ones of those cheap 10 dollar ones.  I LOVE this stroller.  It is super light. It is really easy to fold up on my own and quickly when I am in line for security. The back basket was SO easy to get to.  I have tried to get into the backs of a Mclaren stroller before it was much harder.  This was a great buy and worth it for our trip. I love that the padding is removable for washing or for hot days.  I have noticed that since my trip my stroller doesn't stand on its own as well either.
B0017NC77I I bought this stroller because it's so light and easy on my back!Here are the reasons I love it:-Super light-Easy to maneuver, even with one hand-nice large canopy-removable seat so you can wash easily-decent sized basket-Easy to open and close-Stands up when closed (This is SO nice!)I really have no complaints right now. We use the stroller for either quick trips outside or quick errands. The terrain around my house is pretty rugged, so we use our Vista for neighborhood walks. This is really just for me to be able to pop baby in the stroller if I want to run an errand or shop in a small store. Even though it doesn't recline, we decided it probably wouldn't matter for us since I only use for quick trips.**To address some problems people have had**Before purchasing I read that some people had problems with the basket catching on the closing mechanism, but I haven't had that problem. Also, I'm 5'3\" and haven't had problems kicking the wheels. My Father-in-law is much taller than me and my husband - He's around 6' and did kick the wheels quite a bit.**Money-Saving Tip**...Uppababy usually comes out with an updated line of their strollers every year around February/March I think. Check for sales on the older versions then; there are usually not that many worthy changes to the newer ones (though, sometimes there are). I know one year the only change were the color options, and they still lowered the price!
B0017NC77I I went into a local stroller store with my heart set on buying the Maclaren volo and ended up walking out with this stroller instead.  The reasons I was going to get the Volo were1.  Lightweight--I needed a stroller to take on the subway that I might actually be able to carry up and down the stairs if i had too.  Our other stroller (City Mini) is fantastic but just too heavy for me to do that alone.2.  Mesh sides.  I wanted something that would be cool for summer since often I carry him in a Mei Tai but in the summer it just gets too hot.  I planned on getting a universal seat liner for the winter to insulate hiis back a bit.3.  Easily steerable with one hand.The reasons I ended up with the G Lite are1.  I picked up both strollers and this really did feel lighter--not by much but every bit helps.  Ultimately with all the accessories I2.  This has a cushy seat liner that is meshy and looks cool but is also a little padded.  BUT you can remove it and there is a full mesh only seat underneath, perfect for really hot days.  WIth this I don't need to worry about his butt getting too cold in winter and don't need to buy an extra piece (which only adds to the price) and I can have it be even cooler on very hot days.  Additionally the seat pad is included in the weight so the stroller only gets lighter if you remove it, while the Volo would just get heavier if you added one on.3.  The sun hood is not as big as with the Volo BUT it is pivotable so you can tilt it forward, the Maclaren can't do that.  Because of the way the back apron on the hood is set up it is easier to peek in on your baby in the stroller--I really hated that it was so hard to see him when he was in the Maclaren.  The sun hood doesn't seem like it is water resistant like the Maclaren but since I have to keep the raincover on us all the time for walking around the city it isn't a big deal.4.  I think it is easier to steer and turns more easily.5.  The basket is more accessible, though not quite as deep.6.  It folds so so so so much easier.  I always get really frustrated with Maclarens and folding, I just can't seem to do it easily.7.  I like that this can stand on it's own since our apartment isn't that big.8.  It comes with a cup holder.9.  The rain hood has a mesh panel in front of their face so you can flip the vinyl up there and some fresh air can get in.  I'm not a fan of vinyl stroller covers since you are basically enclosing your child in the very stuff we are trying to keep out of their toys, but they are a necessity.  When it is only lightly raining I always debate about whether to use it or not.  Since this sun hood really isn't water resistant it isn't really a debate with this stroller, but the lift up flap makes me feel like there is a little more ventilation going on in there.  There are also holes in the rain hood which I think are odd and I'm guessing are going to be annoying in a rain storm, but my son isn't made of sugar and I'd rather him get some fresh air and get a little damp from time to time.10.  The rain hood is lighter weight than the Volo's and since I carry it on the stroller all the time this makes the stroller even lighter still.11.  Price.  At my local store this stroller was 99 dollars and the rain hood 20 so all together it was $120.  The Maclaren is then $10 more (it came with a rain hood, but not all do).  But since I also was planning on buying a seat liner for winter it is actually a more significant amount.12.  construction.  After looking at the Uppa Baby the MAclaren fabric seems kind of cheap or flimsier.  On an old Volo that we inherited and were replacing (because it was falling apart) the seat fabric was falling off the hooks that attach it to the frame.  I would hook it back on and find it falling off again an hour or so later.  The Uppa Baby seat wraps around the frame so it seems sturdier.13.  Posture.  In the G Lite the baby sits more forward in the stroller than in the Maclaren.  But in the Maclaren he seemed more slouchy and hunched over.  His posture was better in this stroller and it seems to have better support.14.  The brakes.  I hate engaging the Maclaren brakes, these are much easier.  That is a much more safer option since I use them more frequently when it isn't a pain.And then as I pushed it home I discovered15.  Because the frame is structured so the babies weight is more toward the front of the stroller it doesn't seem to tip backward as easily.  The diaper bag I had on the handle bars stayed easily with my son in the stroller and there was no threatening to tip.  In our old Volo that was absolutely not true.  As I was pushing it I could feel it was back heavy and might tip if I let go.  I don't really recommend putting a diaper bag that heavy on the handlebars but it is nice to know this can accommodate a little more weight.Weighing the stroller with the sun cover, rain cover, cup holder, seat liner, and maclaren organizer it weighs 10 pounds.  The Volo with all these things would weigh at least 11.Everyone is different and will feel differently about these two very similar strollers, so I really recommend checking them out in person--you might change your mind too!
B0017NC77I This stroller is brilliant. It's very easy to set up, within a couple minutes you're ready to roll. The wheels turn on a dime. The handles are long enough for both my husband (6' and me 5'5\") and I to push without kicking the wheels. My daughter is 3 and loves riding in it. It's ability to stand up on it's own when folded makes it easy to take to restaurants or sports games and put it aside. The net underneath is big enough to store a kids backpack and your purse. It's great for travel, goes anywhere easily. We also have a quinny, that while I love it, this one is so much better for everyday use. It has all the benefits but is so much smaller and lightweight.Nevermind a one hand fold, this has a one finger fold. You pull the tab and it collapses, the safety keeps you from pulling the tab while anyone is in it. There's no cons for the stroller, I can't believe it's only $107!
B0017NC77I I purchased this in preparation of our up-coming airline and Disney trip and like it thus far.  Three things that really make this stroller stand out are: 1) Lightweight 2) Nice/functional sun canopy 3) Useable/accessible basket (I got rid of my Maclaren over the pathetic basket). This stroller is easy to fold and re-open and the stand up feature and shoulder carry strap are a plus.  The fold on this stroller doesn't achieve a complete flat fold like a Maclaren, but it is not far off.  My husband is 6'5\" and I am 5'5\" and we both find it easy to push without kicking the back wheels too.  This didn't happen for my husband with my former Maclaren Techo.  This stroller doesn't recline, but I am okay with that since my kids have never slept in a stroller.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and my up-coming trip will really put it to the test.  My only wishes would be 1) built to handle more weight than 40 pound child 2)Optional snap on and tilt to one side so child could exit snack tray. 3)larger wheels to handle all terrain.Update --- stroller handled airline travel well and was great at Disney.  I had the stroller basket packed with snacks, clothes and towels and it did great!  One signficant problem I had was the seat fabric bunching up and getting trapped around the locking mechanism when folding the stroller which resulted in ripping the top and bottom of the seat in addition to putting a hold dead center where the locking mechanism was.  I called UppaBaby customer service and they were FANTASTIC! I took pictures of the damage and scanned my stroller receipt and emailed it to them.  I had a replacement stroller in three days!  Now that is customer service!
B0017NNSRQ This was to match the nursery theme in our new grandson's room! Just precious! I was very impressed at how well it was made. Stitching was close and tight and just perfect for a baby!!! It was quite a bit larger than I expected it to be and just adorable. Now he's almost a year old and he loves it too!!!
B0017NNSRQ I'm not so sure what all the hype is over this monkey. When I got him he felt very stiff to the touch, not soft and cuddly like stuffed animals should be. He's cute but not what I expected in a baby/toddler toy. I sent him back and had to pay about as much for shipping as the toy cost, so no refund there!
B0017NNSRQ I bought this for my newborn daughter, though she's far too small (and unaware) for it yet. My 2-year-old son saw it, and loves it! So I may be buying a 2nd one for his little sister. Seems well-made and doesn't seem like it will fall apart quickly. As someone else noted, it has an un-removable \"necklace\" that says NoJo all the way around. Frustrating, but the animal itself is very good.Good animal, minus stupid necklace = 4 stars
B0017NNSRQ This monkey was pretty big and you cant take off the neck thing it has. Hes a cute monkey, but my kid didnt really seem to care for him.
B0017OAGHU I use this all the time for my mattress when a diaper leaks. It leaves my mattress smelling clean (a little strong-smelling, but I can live with that) and neutralizes the urine smell. No idea why it isn't carried in stores.
B0017OAGHU This is the best stain remover. Sometimes you have to scrub or soak it for a while but it gets out stains that I had trouble getting out with bleach even! I've found it in stores at Meijer, and Babies r us, and I think Walmart. Great product, I recommend it to all new moms!
B0017OAGHU I used it on a mattress. Followed instructions on bottle. Stains are still barely there, but absolutely no order left behind.I also use it on clothes.
B0017OAGHU What i love about this is that you DO NOT have to let the remover soak and sit on it. You can JUST SPRAY IT & THROW IT RIGHT IN THE WASH! NO worries, Ive actually gotten to the point where after its done washing i wont even look to see if the stain is gone, i just know its vanished! LIKE MAGIC!
B0017OAGHU Does not get those tough stains out. Great for a toddler who doesnt spill/play in dirt but if your kids are like mine, they are filthy by the end of the day and this just wont cut it.
B0017P3LQW I bought this despite the bad reviews and I wanted to wait until I had really used it before I wrote a review to see how well it would hold up.  Now that winter is coming to an end, I have to say that I wouldn't have wanted to go through the winter without the 212 blanket.  Walking and subway are my primary form of transportation and my 1yr old son and I walk about one mile home together from daycare every evening so there is no way to avoid my son being out in some cold and windy weather.  I've used the 212 Blanket every day for the last 3 months and I've been very happy with it.  I did have a minor issue with the quality (there is a pacifier strap on the inside and the snap broke the first time I tried to use it) but other than that the Blanket is still like new.  I have a lighter weight stroller blanket (JJ Cole Urban Toddler Bundle Me - Stealth) for the spring and fall but I needed something more substantial that would stand up to a New England winter.  With the 212 Blanket my son is always warm no matter how cold or windy it is.  It also does a great job of keeping him dry if there's light snow.  The convenience factor of this product is huge.  When I pick my son up from daycare I don't have to worry about getting him to sit still long enough to wrangle him into a snow suit.  I put him in the stroller and zip up the blanket 212.  If it's really windy or cold then I'll also add a hat.  If I did a coat too it would be too warm most of the time, although I have added a coat once or twice when the weather was extreme.  If it's especially windy, I find my son will pull up the blanket to cover more of his face but most of the time we walk around and all you see is a little baby's face poking out of the stroller.  I like that it's an adjustable size so I can keep him warmer by keeping it snug.  The straps are very adjustable so I imagine it would fit most strollers well.  There are extra velcro attachments on the underside to help it stay put on the stroller.  I use it with my BOB Revolution and the only \"fit\" problem is that the sunshield on the stroller sometimes gets in the way of the hood of the blanket when I'm putting my son in or taking him out.  I could probably get around that if I unzipped and re-zipped the hood while putting my son in the stroller, but it's not irritating enough to warrant the extra effort.  In the next several weeks I'll probably be putting the blanket 212 into storage.  I can't imagine having gone through this winter without our blanket 212 and I look forward to using it again next winter.
B0017P3LQW We have had this product for about a month now in NYC, and it keeps my son very  warm and also seems to improve the quality of his stroller naps when we move him from one location to another.  They don't provide instructions on how to install this anywhere, which I find kind of annoying, so you just have to try to figure it out yourself.  Hence the 4 stars.
B0017P3LQW Now that it served my son for almost four months, I can say that I like just about everything about this product - the look, the quality, the level of warmth it provides.  Highly recommend!
B0017P3LQW I walk a lot with my family and we would not be as active during the cold weather without this bunting. It has been invaluable to me and my little ones during the winter.  It is very warm; perfect for children who dislike layers. Prior to owning the Blanket 212 I used aJJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Stealth, Infant. When my child outgrew the JJ Cole bunting I knew I needed something more substantial, I found this and I am glad I purchased it. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:- Very warm.- Doesn't slide down the seat when getting my child in and out.- Adjustable length and width- Looks great- Useful front pocket- Washable- Easily converts from toddler to baby sizeThe B212 has served us well for one child through 2 winters but now that I have a second baby I wanted to use this again and I have run into a few problems.Cons:- Not very durable. The bunting has begun to unravel at the seams of the hood and where the harness straps thread through the body of the bunting.- Hood isn't removable. This is important to me because my baby gets very hot while sleeping and sweats a lot from her head and neck.- Doesn't fit all of the strollers I own. Fits the City Mini and Mountain Buggy Urban but does not fit the UPPAbaby Vista or Cosatto umbrella strollers well.- When shortened to accommodate a baby the bottom is drafty.I still believe this item deserves 4 stars and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again. I used this with my first child from 18 months to 3 years and sparingly for my now 7 month old. I did contact 7A.M customer service about the seams unraveling and while they were unable to repair or replace the bunting the response was fairly quick and very cordial.
B0017S2S86 I've been using this mattress for six months and it's great.  There are no dents or impressions in it.  I am looking forward to being able to still use this when she is a toddler.
B0017S2S86 DaVinci Emily II 2-in-1 6\" 242 Coil MattressI bought this mattress as a replacement of an older 2-in-1 mattress that my toddler used from birth (a Sealy from Babies R Us).  When it came time to purchase a new one, the Sealys were all sold out on Amazon, so I picked out this model as a \"next-best\" without remembering exactly how much I spent on the previous one.  The price seemed a little steep, but once I saw how much comparable models go for in stores, I felt a little better.It isn't as heavy as the previous mattress, and is actually a bit softer in the springs.  I am not sure what the coil count is for the other mattress.  I couldn't really detect any major difference in \"bounce\" from the infant to toddler side for either mattress.One thing I wish I'd looked into is whether it had a handle on the sides, which makes it easier for lifting in and out of the crib when you're changing the sheet.  This particular model does not, but it is still fairly easy to manage.So I guess I'd say this mattress is okay for quality, but you're probably just as well off buying a single sided mattress from the store and save your money.  There's rarely a huge difference on any of the 2-sided mattresses, and your toddler isn't likely to notice anyway.
B0017S2S86 I'm giving this product 3.5 stars. I received this along with the DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib as part of my baby registry. I specifically wanted this mattress because of the value and fit to the DaVinci Emily crib. After reading existing reviews on multiple mattresses, I was concerned about the mattress fit in the crib since last thing I want are mishaps happening to my child. So after much research again and countless hours of reading consumer reports, I figured I can't go wrong with the fit if the mattress is also by the same manufacturer as the crib. I even measure the mattress area of the crib to make sure I got the exact measurements to that of what's published on the product description!The Emily 2 Sided Mattress was exactly what I had measured in the crib BUT when it arrived and I applied it into the Emily crib,the measurements are off from what's listed on Amazon's product details and the product box that it came in by a few centimeters on all 4 sides. Most parents might be fine with this considering how many other mattresses out there are off by inches rather than centimeters but considering baby safety, I was a bit concern of her fingers or toes getting stuck between the mattress and crib rails. So in the end, did I keep this product?I did - with some reinforcements to those centimeter gaps. I took up another reviewer's advice from another DaVinci mattress and stuck some towels on the side facing the wall, which worked perfectly and kept the mattress amazingly snugged in the crib with absolutely no gaps anywhere; and with the crib bumpers, you can't even tell there were towels involved!The big plus of this mattress I must add is 
B0017S2S86 After 4-month use, it is already sagging in middle. Fortunately, I am moving and so I will have to buy a new one, of course, a different one.
B0017S2S86 I got this mattress to match my Emily crib, figuring if I ordered the two products from the same manufacturer, there won't be any guess work with sizing issues (I read some reviews in which the mattress didn't fit the crib and didn't want to run into that problem). BUT...after about a month of using the crib, I noticed one day that there was a GAP between this mattress and my Emily crib, about a 1.5 inch gap if you pushed the mattress to either the right or left! I had to stick 3 rolled up receiving blankets in the gap so as to make the crib safer. I contacted Million Dollar Baby and submitted to them copies of pictures illustrating the gap and they're sending me a new crib altogether. I don't know if its the mattress or the crib not fitting. There should not be a gap. Besides the gap, the mattress seems to have \"memorized\" my son's body as there's a slight dent in the mattress where he sleeps. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. If I rotate the mattress I'm sure that problem will be solved. He sleeps on the Infant side of the mattress. Not sure if I would recommend this mattress because of the gap issue that I have (it could be the crib! But the crib looks properly assembled.)
B000P7FVX4 Easy to cut (minimal fraying), easy to sew (fold over once and stitch), and the selvedge edge is bound neatly.This 64-70% shade version is great for shading vegetable beds in very hot summer sun.  I attached it to my PVC shade structures with PVC grip clamps and they hold onto the fabric marvelously.
B000P7FVX4 We cut to shape and installed on the underside of our lattice patio cover to further block the sun.  It does a fine job.  Wanted something easily removable when wisteria covers the top and provides natural shade.
B000RYPZQ8 I have one of these that was given to me years ago, and it is still my favorite gardening 'tool'.  The paint still looks pretty good, the hinges still work, and the cushion is still soft on my old knees.  I love that in the kneeling position, the side rails give me help in getting up.  Also, I can quickly flip it over and it's a seat for taking off my shoes or just taking a load off.  I know my green-thumb daughter will love hers.
B0013OX9NC I can't give this 5 stars yet. I'm waiting to see if I can SEE the four stars without the benefit of my glasses and hopefully, these Lutein supplements will help me do so.I like that they're easy to swallow and don't \"come back up.\"  Lutein is a great way to guard against macular degeneration so I'm looking forward (literally) to seeing the results.I will update this review soon to share the results.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a chemical found in healthy eyes. There is some evidence that adding a lutein supplement to your diet will protect your vision and perhaps improve it. Some reviewers here claim better vision. So far I can't claim that my vision has improved (but I have only been taking Lutein for about a week). The single-compound food supplement market has been growing over the last few years. Chronditin and other joint-preserving compounds have attracted serious fans. In this case, Lutein is definitely needed (as evidenced that it is found in the retina)by the eye. What isn't clear (yet) is whether or not ingesting Lutein actually makes it from the digestive system to the retina.It comes down to personal preference. For the relatively low price of this supplement, I think it is worth investing in something that appears to be helping people maintain and improve their vision. Are they really helped or just enjoying the placebo effect? I don't know. Jarrow is a reputable brand and I trust that I am getting the indicated dosage. I figure it's worth $12 (approx.) a month to try to insure eye health. If you are also inclined to try Lutein, then this product is a very good choice; the dosage is within the range that eye professionals suggest, the company has a good reputation, and the price is reasonable.I'll report back if/when I feel any direct benefits. For now, I have added it to my daily supplements.One Month ReportNo detectable changes in vision. I am going to continue using this for another 3 months. If I can't find any noticeable changes/improvements, I will discontinue. Stay tuned....
B0013OX9NC My son reviewed this product since he has a retinal/visual impairment.  The product was palatable, and easy to take as directed.  He was unable to notice any difference after three weeks in visual acuity or color differentiation.  As with many supplements and even conventional medication, it is difficult to ascertain an alteration in your body's status without objective forms of measurement before and after.It would be ideal to not only trial this product for a minimum of 3 months, but to also be able to perform visual acuity and color perception assessments along the way.
B0013OX9NC Carotenoids are a family of plant pigments found in fruits and vegetables. They are red in color, but some appear pink or yellow.Salmon, lobster, and shrimp contain the carotenoid called astaxanthin. Carotenoids are powerful anti-aging antioxidants, which protect human body cells from free radicals, which disturb the body's molecular structure. Vitamin C, vitamin E, and lipoic acid are network antioxidants.Jarrow Formulas Lutein( in 60 softgels) contains these revolutionary ingredients that will protect your health(and fight body aging). Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark, green, leafy vegatables. And in this little bottle. The average American absorbs about 2 mg of lutein per day. Don't be average. Kick up your health trajectory. Jarrow Formulas.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow name is the reason I ordered this product.  I always know that Jarrow ships only the best and I was not disappointed.
B0013OX9NC I have an aunt with macular degeneration and she was advised to take Lutein so I decided to try this brand which has been around since 1977. Before I buy from a company I always checkout who owns it. So many of the companies these days have been bought by mega corporations. It seems that Jarrow, though incorporated in 1988 is still run by Jarrow L. Rogovin from their base in Los Angeles. Other than that, the company has a message on the bottom of its page that says it supports US/Isreal relations. The Lutein comes in the form of a medium sized orange football shaped softgel which is easy to swallow. I've taken Lutein for some time so I can't attest to this brand being better or worse than others. It contains 20mg of Leutin from Marigold Petal Extract and 1mg of Zeaxanthin from the same source.
B0013OX9NC Supposedly lutein is great for your eyes and is found in eggs.  So if you have cholesterol issues or egg allergies, this is an option.  They are easy to swallow and no noticeable after taste or smell.But I cannot measure if it's working or not (can't do that with eggs either).  So if you need lutein, this is an option.
B0013OX9NC I haven't noticed any improvement in vision thus far.  Also, I have a cataract in my left eye and no improvement there either, and there have been suggestions that Lutein can improve the vision and/or slow the progression of cataracts.Despite this, I know that Jarrow makes an excellent product and the price seems very reasonable.  4 stars based on that.  Should I begin to notice improvement in any way, I'll update this review and share my findings with anyone who might be interested.
B0013OX9NC In my opinion, Jarrow makes the most high quality supplements.  Their Lutein is no different.  Lutein was recommended to me improve my vision, particularly night vision.  I believe this supplement helps with vision and keeps eyes healthy.  This supplement helps prevent macula degeneration and also helps with focus and color differentiation.  Highly recommended.  Excellent product.
B0013OX9NC I have a dry eye problem at night and thought I would try this (as a Vine Reviewer). I've been taking it for a couple weeks, but I haven't notice any difference. I had been using Fish OilNew Chapter Wholemega, 1000 Mg, 180-Countthat my Optometrist recommended, so I will probably go back to that regime along with this stuff.After doing some research on-line, I discovered that the ingredients in this product (Lutein and Zeaxanthin) are compounds called Xanthophylls, which are naturally-occuring yellow pigments (from Marigolds) and are anti-oxidants. Xanthophylls belong to a class of organic compounds called carotenoids. These compounds might reduce your risk for macular degeneration and cataracts. I am concerned about my eye health especially since I work on a computer and do close-up work throughout the day.The dosage is one and it is a very small soft-gel and easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC My son has recurring anterior uveitis.  Which I have tried to control as holistically as possible.  He takes circumin and quercitin everyday as antiinflammatory compounds. To protect the eye, they suggest carotenoids found in leafy greens.  Well, that goes only so far...it is always a battle.  So we have been supplementing with this pill that helps protect the eye and gives him the carotenoids that I obsess about him getting.His eye has been clear, with the exception of one short flare up, for almost two years.  Yay!  The original diagnosis was pretty grim and a lifetime on crappy steroids scared me for him on so many levels.  I am happy to be controlling it this way.
B0013OX9NC I have been taking this supplement for about a month. I have noticed that my eyes feel stronger and more powerful. I am also supplementing with Beta Carotene. I plan to order more of this &#34;LUTEIN&#34; supplement when this finishes. It appears to me that it is a very effective product!!!
B0013OX9NC I began taking Lutein when I became concerned about my genes...I've never had great ideas but watching my mother slowly and permanently lose her vision is scary and heartbreaking. But that's not to say only those who see their parents in this position need it: After all, my grandparents (my mom's parents) never even needed GLASSES!Simply put, this is insurance for one's eyes, especially in this time when we we are making them do far more work than generations ever before in front of glaring computer screens, e-readers, and far more TV daily.  Who knows what ill effects our generations may see that we have no idea about now as we are the first to enter the digital age?While it's hard to say the improvements on our eyes from a few months of lutein, it does appear that the Jarrow formula has a good quantity and is in pure form, and a good supplement that many doctors say we really should be taking but it's not always found in supplements. (icaps supplements add lutein because of the movement saying we all need it now.)If your vitamin supplement doesn't yet contain lutein, don't forget one of your most important organs as you nourish the rest. I was blind for a year after lasik surgery went wrong, and I can personally tell you living without your eyes is noplace you EVER want to be.  it's affordable insurance against a common issue: eye degeneration.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein 20mg I have not noticed anything positive or negative. I am in my 40's and do quite a bit of reading both on the computer and in print. I don't wear glasses and would like to prevent over stressing my eyes and if it helps taking a product like this to try and keep my eyes in good health. However, I can't say one way or the other if this product helps. It isn't hurting or bothered my eyes since I have taken it. It also hasn't created anything adverse to my normal routine or created any unpleasant side effects for me either.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I start taking lutein and recommended that I take Preservision. This has 10 more milligrams than Preservision and in the stores is about $20 less a month and is recommended by the staff at Sprouts. Then I found it at Amazon. The price at Sprouts in $19, and I saved almost $13 by having it auto-shipped, and there is no shipping cost. I am very please, especially as it is necessary to my vision that I take this. This pill itself is a gel-tab and is fairly small and easy to take.
B0013OX9NC I take one every other day due to the high dose. Little larger than expected so people with small pathways may not like these. I'm a guy that will toss up to four different pills on my tongue and swallow them all together so I have no problem taking these.
B0013OX9NC These Jarrow Lutein 20mg Softgels are marketed as being good for the eyes and, as I am concerned about my failing vision due to diabetes, decided to give these a try. A little on-line research show strong support for Lutein being good for the eyes and my optometrist sells similar supplements, so feel comfortable taking these in the dosage provided. The pills are not too big and seem to be good quality. The results can take quite awhile to manifest so it is hard to quantify that these are making any difference after two week of taking them, but hopefully they are doing what they are purported to do.Recommended!CFH
B0013OX9NC After reaching my 40's, I had noticed a change in the sharpness of my eyesight.  With a lifetime of up to that point 20/20 vision, it was pretty frustrating.  A friend and fellow herbalist recommend that I started taking Lutien and the Jarrow formulas was just the right number of milligrams that I needed at a very good price.Since taking them, my eyesight seems to be improving, though I am very certain that this is a slow process and will much likely be more pronounced over a longer period of time. So while I still do use a set of reading glasses from time to time, I do notice that it is less often.Jarrow Formulas always seems to put out excellent, very reasonably priced supplements. I have yet to be disappointed in anything that I have gotten from Jarrow through Amazon.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking these for a month now and I can't say I've noticed any difference in my vision, but there have been no side effects either. I really wouldn't expect a noticeable improvement in vision, but would take them to help prevent further degradation. These are easily swallowed, brown, ovoid capsules. I've been happy with all four Jarrow products that I've tried.
B0013OX9NC The more you lose eyesight, the more you appreciate it.  This product is supposed to help the eyes against the damaging effects of the type of UV blue light that strikes the retina.I get fewer floaters at night using Lutein.
B0013OX9NC This is a product I have been taking for about 3 months now.THIS brand is a new one to me but all in all it appears tobe the same product and the price is much lower than my last'brand name'.  I am taking this primarily because my Motherhas taken it for about 1 yr. and had her eyes tested and hervision actually got 2% better.  I have hopes of just protectingmy vision...if my vision gets better that is just a bonus!
B0013OX9NC I have been using the Jarrow Formula Lutein for about 3 weeks, during this time I have gained the ability to see through most substances (except oddly.... lead). I have also gained the ability to shoot heat rays from eyes. The only drawback.... I now have this weakness when exposed kryptonite. Crazy stuff....Ok, so Jarrow Formula Lutein has not given me the ability to see through walls, and the ability to shoot heat rays, but it does seem to have helped 
B0013OX9NC It's hard to review supplements accurately but I can give you a glimpse of my experience plus a little research. I have a delicate stomach so I sometimes get heartburn from supplements, but this one did not seem to cause that. I did not notice a benefit either but that can take a long time to show up.According to WebMD, lutein and zeaxanthin are \"linked to lower risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.\"  These compounds are found in various green vegetables such as spinach. But many of us get concerned about vision problems as we get older, so a supplement seems like good insurance.  A consumer-oriented website gave Jarrow Formulas Lutein an \"approved\" rating. They mention that the dose is one that should be helpful yet the cost is reasonable.The source of the lutein and zeaxanthin in this supplement is marigold petals! Some people are likely to be allergic because marigolds are related to chrysanthemums and ragweed. The product also contain soy, one of the top 10 food allergens. Personally I feel that the top 10 food allergens should never be used in supplements, but I suppose manufacturers like to use cheap ingredients.Proceed with caution.
B0013OX9NC Before taking these I asked my ophthalmologist while I was getting my annual exam if it would be helpful. He cautioned against expecting any improvement in my sight, but said it was not a bad idea for long-term ocular health.After taking them for a couple of weeks I have not experienced any improvement in my sight, but it seems to have helped cut down on the close-focus blurries and strain. Granted, it could just be coincidence or my imagination, but I'm pleased enough with the results that I'm willing to pick up another bottle and continue to use it.Zero side effects from usage. The capsules are somewhat large, but remain easy to swallow since they are the gel-type caps (sort of similar to vitamin E caps). They do have a bit of a musty, early smell when you sniff the bottle, but it does not translate to any negative effects, such as bad breath or gastric problems.Definitely worth trying if you're concerned about eye health.
B0013OX9NC My doc recommended this additive to replace Lutein loss. Your eyes have Lutein when you are born, but it isn't reproduced by the body. Lutein filters the ultra violet light that eyes are exposed to. I've been taking this for 5 months and the best way that I can determine if it is working is that my eyes don't seem as light sensitive. I still wear sunglasses when I am outdoors, but the effects of this product is most obvious indoors when the sunglasses are gone.
B0013OX9NC So in my experience, Jarrow is an excellent brand and I have noticed a difference in taking their products (versus other brands).  But I had never taken Lutein before.  I have poor vision made worse by some damage from an eye surgery many years ago, so I thought I'd see if this would help.  There could be more long term effect or maybe I just didn't need this herb, but I didn't notice any effect whatsoever (used 1 full bottle, one pill a day).  If you are interested in Lutein, I would try this brand.
B0013OX9NC I've been trying to take this so I can give an honest review, but it smells like something you'd step in in the barnyard.  It's bad enough getting it down, but then when I burp I smell it all over again.  And, it seems like it makes me burp more often, or maybe I just notice it more because of the stench.  I would have to say it just doesn't agree with me.  I'm still trying to take it, but yuck.  My cousin's doctor recommended this to her because she has macular degeneration and she swears by it.  I wanted to try it because I'm nearing fifty and have noticed that my eyesight is not as good as it used to be.
B0013OX9NC My Mother has a rare form of macular degeneration and has been told to let her family members know so they can be checked for the same disease.  Once checked, the optomerist told me to take lutein for my eye health and I did not have macular degeneration as of now.  This lutein formula is just what I was looking for to keep eyes healthy.  Jarrow Formula Lutein is one of the best on the market and mine came from Amazon.  If you are concerned about your eyes' health please check out this product and I think you will be pleased..Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels
B0013OX9NC I don't know if it's natural or what but the ones I received kind of smelled and like to stick together.
B0013OX9NC I got this product because  I was concerned with my eyes. I used to go tanning at the salon and I didn't always use the eye protection. And over the past few months I have noticed that when i am driving at night the lights of on coming cars seem ridiculously bright. I bought this product in hopes that it would help my eyes to heal. I have read other reviews on this product and they rave on how awesome it is, so i hope it works for me.
B0013OX9NC This is a good source of lutein and it's liquid, so it absorbs quickly. I always try to avoid tablets for supplements, as your body doesn't assimilate them as well as gels or capsules.I would also suggest anyone who is looking to improve eyesight engage in eating better and exercising. You can do this by eating produces high in lutein (like kale and spinach - organic is much, much better). Get a juicer and mix these with organic carrot and organic apples for maximum benefit and to improve the flavor.For eye exercises, the book Eye Yoga is FANTASTIC.So get your lutein supplement and supplement it with a little extra effort and you'll be happy with the results.
B0013OX9NC I have some health related issues with my eyes so I wanted to see if Lutein made a noticeable difference. I've heard lots of positive things about it. Honestly it's hard after just one bottle with this supplement to tell if it's make a difference. It was easy to take and didn't give me any adverse side effects like some can do.
B0013OX9NC I have no way to actually measure the direct effect this has had on me in the month I've been taking it. Nothing bad at least. What I can say is that, unlike other supplements, this one does not have a funky taste (it actually has no taste at all). The pills are small and easy to swallow. I've read a lot about Lutein, which is why I decided to give it a try. You should definitely do your own research before deciding to take any supplements (and check with your doctor). If you decide to go with Lutein, then this one seems fine to me!
B0013OX9NC I had Lasik surgery about 5 years ago and I try to maintain my vision as best I can.  I have been taking Lutein supplements for a short time and health magazines always recommend it for better vision.  These small pills last 2 months if taken daily and they are the size of a peanut M&M.  They are coated and are easy to swallow.  If you are looking for a Lutein supplement, this is a good buy.  I highly recommend it.
B0013OX9NC The pills are small, about the size of a pea. Or an edamame bean. They are soft and super easy to swallow. No stickiness, no smell, nothing negative. Seen no side-effects, and will wait to see if it helps my eyesight. Right on the 20/40 border for near vision, and my doctor said to try this and lets see (ha ha) what happens. Lutein was found to help prevent eyesight in a study cited by the normally very skeptical Center for Science in the Public Interest, so I've subscribed to this product now.
B0013OX9NC Daverat's Wife speaking (pls be kind RE: Typos; I have arthritis) I'm starting to experience some minor focusing issues that all people usually find they suffer in the mid 30s through their 40s and I also have a concern about Age-Related Macular Degeneration in my family, also known as: AMD.  So, I began looking at Lutein supplements and other \"Vision Vitamins'.  Specifically, I brought this bottle of plain Jarrow Lutein supplement and their jazzier soundingJarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsulesinto my doctor's office for his opinion.  He's a GP who is quite open to vitamins and food supplements for both treatment and prevention as long as he knows what's in them and can look up any potential problems they might cause.  He cleared me to take this Lutein supplement for prevention without any problems.  I showed him the other bottle and after he put HIS reading glasses on to check the ingredients out in his side effects App on his computer, he began to frown.  Long story short, he told me to toss the other ones and take THIS Jarrow Lutein for AS LONG AS I COULD AFFORD TO since it is a PREVENTATIVE and not a miracle supplement that gives you results in 30 days.  He felt everyone over 35 should adding Preventative doses of Lutein to their supplements.I like Jarrow products for price and simplicity  As long as you CHECK the formulations and ingredients dosages, they can be very effective and economical.  I regularly order theirJarrow Formulas Whey Protein, French Vanilla, 2 Poundwith my monthly Subscribe & Save items.  It's the one of the best Whey Proteins my husband and I have ever used and at such a good price.  Likewise I'm impressed with this Lutein because it contains 20 Mgs of Lutein plus the added ingredient of 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  My doctor told me that people used to say all you needed was 6 Mgs of Lutein for protection against AMD but that was the bare minimum to see any benefit at all.  He was the one who told me that 20 mgs was the current thinking and that Lutein without any Zeaxanthin is pretty much useless.  Apparently Zeaxanthin is the material that makes up the Macula of your retina and having the 2 together is the best protection.  This Jarrow Lutein has the 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in addition to the 20 Mgs of Lutein.  the two together form 1 preventative supplement to help  prevent the onset of AMD as you get older.Taking a  Daily Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement is largely a protection against Age-Related Macular Degneration.  I have Aunts who suffer from this and I wanted the protective benefits that taking a daily supplement can provide.  The people rating this based on improved vision seem to misunderstand what the purpose of such a supplement is.  You will NOT LIKELY see short term results.  This is a Supplement you take for THE LONG HAUL from mid life til you die in the hopes that it affords you some significant protection from Macular Degeneration due to age.  Studies have indicated that this dosage and formulation can have a positive effect on your risk but that's it.  Lutein is no magic pill against middle-aged myopia.  You will still need your reading glasses, I'm afraid.I am pleased that the dosage & formulation are correct, the price is economical and there are no added on, unnecessary ingredients with potentional side effects on medications such as other \"pumped up\" vision supplements have.  In fact, the major source of the Lutein in the Jarrow formulation is Marigold Petal Extract, an old herbalists remedy dating back thousands of years.  As far as we were able to see, neither my doctor nor I could find any potential interactions.  Vegans, however, be aware that there is beeswax and gelatin in the softgels.  There is also Soybean oil if that is of a concern to some. I will be adding this to my monthly delivery schedule and I'm so glad Jarrow makes basic supplements in addition to their more \"out there\" supplements for the adventurous self-helpers.Remember, taking your Lutein is like eating your carrots - you may not notice the difference for years to come but hoo-boy you'll be glad you did it one day.
B0013OX9NC This product contains Lutein and Zeaxanthin, two plant pigments that are also present in the human eye. Because of this, research suggests both are helpful in preventing eye problems. Some research also suggests Lutein may be helpful in improving skin health, taken orally, or applied directly. I make a cream out of Lutein (and other pigments like Lycopene) that I apply at night. Just be warned Lutein is a dark red dye, and a little goes a long way when mixed with creams.This is a good Lutein product, with some oil and mixed tocopherols (a form of Vitamin E, included to keep the product fresh). This is the best way to take Lutein, because it needs some fat to be absorbed properly. The price of this product, when discounted, is pretty good.My eyes are pretty good, and I had LASIK surgery ten years ago. Since I have started taking Lutein, my vision seems even crisper, but it is hard to tell if this is Lutein-related, since I take other supplements. I take this product knowing it is helping to prevent future eye problems.Overall, this is a solid product for a good price.
B0013OX9NC I've been using Jarrow products for a long time and have never been disappointed.  This is no exception.  I'm convinced that Lutein helps protect the eyes and vision protection supplements now often include Zeaxanthin.  I've read that the optimum ratio might be 5 to 1.  This product is 20 to 1, so it might be a bit light on the Zeaxanthin.  The price seems to be fair.  You can get similar warehouse brand products for a bit less and you can pay much more for name brand.  I think it's good value and good insurance for your eye sight.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is found in many dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, and collard greens, etc., and is good for maintaining good vision and prevent macular degeneration.  The macula is a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.  Lutein accumulates more in the peripheral areas of the retina while zeaxanthin accumulates more in the macula region.  Both lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to have anti-oxidative properties and protect the retina/macula from harmful blue light.  My family and I try to maintain a well balanced nutrition but it's helpful to supplement regular leafy green vegetable intake with Lutein supplements.What's good about Jarrow Formulas (JF) Lutein:>Each softgel contains 20mg of lutein (esters) and 1mg of zeaxanthin.>My family's eyes tend to be less strained and our annual eye exams indicate no vision health problems.What's questionable about Lutein supplements in general:>20mg of lutein esters usually yields approx. 10mg of free lutein.  The amount of free lutein absorbed by the retina/macula is unknown.>We've taken the JF brand of 20mg lutein supplements since 2010 and there are no noticeable differences compared to other brands' 20mg geltabs.>There's no DV or Daily (recommended) Value for lutein or zeaxanthin.  Possible side effects of excessive lutein intake.>Each geltab contains mostly soybean oil and the softgel ingredients of gelatin, glycerin, and water.Overall:Taking lutein geltab supplements is helpful but it's more important to maintain a balanced, healthy diet with plenty of leafy green vegetables, wear blue light blocking sunglasses, and don't overstrain one's eyes, etc., to maintain good vision and retinal/macular health.
B0013OX9NC I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a small, very easy to swallow pill. Still not sure if it is permanently useful for my eyes because I've only used it a few weeks but haven't noticed eye strain as much as I used to have when I'm on the computer too long,like 14 hours at a time, so it must be helping with that because I'm not using any other product that helps that. So I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working. I'll keep using it and see if it gets rid of all my eye strain problems. Since the Vine program is now requiring a review of every product before you can get more and new ones come out every 3rd Thursday of the month and the next just a week later, I will not have time to try anything for long before the review has to be written. Also will have to write reviews for products as I understand them to work for items that haven't even been delivered before the 4th Thursdays of each month comes out and will just have to update them after they come and I can actually have time to try them.UPDATE: I've been using this for sometime now and NO MORE eye strain. Feels good to be able to watch TV or be on the computer as much as I want and no eye strain and no ruptured blood vessels. I sleep better too because I don't have eye burn when I close my eyes to sleep. Great stuff....
B0013OX9NC I have been using Lutein for years as macular degeneration runs in my family. When I saw the Jarrow formula I was thrilled as I know that Jarrow makes good products. I was not disappointed. The gel was small and easy to swallow, and these pills will be replacing my previous Luteins in my daily vitamin routine.
B0013OX9NC It is common to avoid taking care of your eyes. Since taking Lutein, my eyes feel younger. I can feel the difference.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor recommended that I use Lutein and I started using these about two weeks ago. I don't see a lot of vision improvement, but am using it more as a preventative for macular degeneration. So far after two years use, no macular degeneration!I really like these particular softgels. They go down easy, don't upset my stomach and seem to be more organic than the last brand that I purchased. I will continue to use these.
B0013OX9NC I've always had exceptional eyesight (20/10), but as I've grown older I've been noticing a decline in my vision. After doing some research I decided to start taking a Lutein supplement. I wanted a supplement that contained at least 20mg of Lutein at a reasonable price. This Jarrow Formulas product fit the bill, so I ordered a bottle. I've got about a week's worth left and I can definitely say my vision has improved. I can't say it's solely from the Lutein because I also quit drinking soda/pop after finding out that Aspartame is bad for eyes. Additionally, I started taking a Bilberry supplement around the same time I began taking this Lutein. Regardless, I know my vision is improving so I will continue to take Lutein and Bilberry supplements. Thanks for reading.
B0013OX9NC My DH has terrible trouble with his eyes getting inflamed, his sight floating so his new glasses don't work that well, and just eye strain in general. He's been to any number of opthamologists and regular doctors, none of whom have been able to tell him what is wrong. All they can recommend is eye drops to keep his eyes from being too dry. I do know his father had macular degeneration, so we're going to try this formula to see if it will help him. The lutein, as I understand it, concentrates in the macula of the eye and helps with focus. The pills themselves are soft and not too large, kind of like a roundish Vitamin E capsule but a little larger, so I hope he'll take them.
B0013OX9NC I figure these would at best help with an ongoing macular issue and at worst do nothing. The seem to have done nothing whatsoever in 2 weeks. The softgels are easy to swallow - not as large as a typical vitamin and that's a good thing. They did not cause any digestive upset or issues - some supplements can have unforseen & unfortunate stomach consequences. However, there was no change any sort noted with regard to actual eye care. Oh well... at least they did no harm.
B0013OX9NC An important thing to know about Lutein is that It is best absorbed with a high fat meal.  If you are taking this and are on a low fat diet, perhaps take this with your Omegas or with some type of healthy fat. Otherwise, you are losing effectiveness of the supplement .  For those not seeing benefits, please try taking them with a high fat meal and see if it makes a difference.My diet is already pretty high in Lutein.  One bottle lasted me for two months.  During the two months that I took the supplement, I did notice an improvement in my vision.  So, although I had an adequate intake of Lutein, the extra oomph did make a difference.I would recommend giving this a try if vision health is a concern.  I learned that I could add a cup of cooked spinach to my diet each day and get the same amount of lutein.  I do think the supplements have value and Jarrow is a company that I trust. I would recommend them.
B0013OX9NC I have been using it for over 7 days...I have noted a better feel to my skin...I do not have bad eyes, but at 47 years old I do note an improvement...well worth the money
B0013OX9NC Easy on the digestive tract and if they help postpone cataract surgery then they are worth it as I am not looking forward to that.
B0013OX9NC The label tells me what it DOESN'T have ie gluten, wheat etc but fails to tell me that the SOYBEAN OIL is GMO! Over 86% of the CORN and SOY in the USA IS a GMO ingredient.  I will no longer buy this product and will search for a NON GMO product.
B0013OX9NC I'll be staying on this product for 1 year.  In the last 4 years I have developed 'floaters' in my eyes and luckily no macular degeneration.  I also had cateracts removed in 2011.I can't say I have noticed any change in vision in the last 2 months but the proof will be when I see my eye doctor in 10 months and she can tell me if my eyes have changed for the worse. If not, I will stay on the product. $60 a year for a chance to safeguard good eye health is worth it.
B0013OX9NC Lutein seems to be one of those supplements that actually has a solid backing of research to back it up.Basically it helps your eyes, and can help some conditions that effect the eyes, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, among others.The 'pill' (gel pack) is quite small, easy to swallow.  If you have eye conditions (or don't want to), this may be an easy decision.
B0013OX9NC What I like about this product mostly, is its affordable price. For someone who has been using mostly Occuvite, and Bausch and Lomb Vision Eye Vitamin, and paying a nice amount of change to keep it going, this product I was hoping, more like praying actually, could be a viable substitute for the more expensive options. I know that in the Lutein department it certainly delivers, but since I am no expert on the subject, I ask myself over and over: \"is this Jarrow Lutein as good as Occuvite, per say?\". The answer is not immediately answered because as we all know, this kind of product must be used with regularity, month after month, in order to accurately decide if its doing what is supposed to do. So, what is the product supposed to do? For one, make my eyes stronger, provide much needed nutrition to avoid serious eye loss, or diseases related to the eyes. Like any part of the body the eyes have to be provided with all the help they need, and Lutein, I keep reading, is quite a healthy boost for their performance.The price in which these soft gels are sold make them very affordable to use month after month. Also the fact that only one a day is the recommended daily use makes a bottle of 60 last two months. Yes! I can see myself being able and happy to provide this much needed nutrient to my eyes, versus more costly options. At the same time I wonder if the more expensive offerings provide a more complete package, sort of speak.Either way, it is highly appreciated that I had the chance to use Jarrow Formulas Lutein, 20mg, 60 count, and I have Amazon to thank for that. It is a great alternative to the higher priced products out there. On the other hand, is very hard to make a determination on just 30 days of using a new product, for we all know it takes regular use to fully appreciate its virtues and setbacks, but those are the rules of the game, and I was expected to render a verdict within 30 days. I could have waited a few more days, but I am sure I will like them the same when the time comes. 60 soft gels for under $10? What is there not to like? Perhaps Jarrow is the one company who thinks about the prize being more affordable, and if that is their mentality of business then I praise them, just as long as their products are as good as they certainly sound. 4 Stars for now.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' \"Lutein\" is a dietary suppliment for support of visual function and protection of the macula. The bottle contains 60 softgels which while big can be easily swallowed. There is 20 mg of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in each softgel.Since there is history of eye deterioration I thought this would be a product to try. I have been taking 1 softgel per day as directed on the package for a little over a week now, but it is difficult to almostimpossible to determine the effectiveness of the product. Some doctors prescribe lutein for their senior patients, others say that it will not harm or help your eyes. I have taken other brands of lutein in the past without any side effects. I have found that even with taking this \"Lutein\" with food as directed on the package that about an hour or 2 hours after taking the softgel I experience some stomach and/or lower G.I pain which last several hours. It is not severe pain but is discomforting. Perhaps it is a coincidental that I take the softgel and then experience pain but it has been 9 days in a row. I don't think I have ever had zeaxanthin in the other lutein I have taken and wonder if that may be the cause of the discomfort.
B0013OX9NC Love all the Jarrow vitamin supplements. Jarrow has done it again with the amazing Lutein formula for increased eye support. My 80+ father in law who had macular degeneration swears by this.
B0013OX9NC I've reached that age where it seems every printed page is getting smaller, every attempt to focus my eyes requires concentration and a few seconds, and every morning and night is a new experiment in decreasing degrees of visual acuity, which is to say, I need reading glasses more and more and I'm about to give up entirely on trying to focus on anything less than three feet away whenever I am tired (early in the morning or late at night). I mentioned this problem to a gentleman even older than I am, and he recommended a vitamin that contained lutein. Since I already take a regular multivitamin, I figured adding lutein to my current regimen might help me out just as well.What I have read about lutein is that it will not help you regain visual ability or better focus or anything like that. What it will do is prevent your macula and lens from experiencing as much of the degeneration that comes naturally with aging (maybe). The good news is, these soft gels are relatively small, about the size of a 400 i.u. vitamin E, and just as easy to take. The bad news is, well, there is no bad news other than, I cannot tell if these are helping my eyes are not. I'm prepared to say that I will err on the side of caution and maybe take this product on a regular basis if I feel my eyes are getting \"worser and worser\" than they would normally, but short of that, I don't think this is something I need to take on regular basis. At least, I can't see (sorry) taking it every day just yet.
B0013OX9NC About five years ago, I found that I needed to start using glasses for reading.  Recently someone recommended this product to help decrease my reliance on the glasses, and I have to say that so far it seems to work.  Don't get me wrong!  I haven't been able to toss out my glasses, but the fact is that my mid range and distance vision have both improved a bit since I started taking Jarrow's Lutien tablets.  I've been using two tablets a day, and where I've noticed the most improvement is in seeing with dim light.  In a dark room, before the lutien, I had difficulty reading my watch without glasses on - since beginning to take the Jarrow product, I find I can read it without the extra lenses.  Not a miracle cure by any means, but its good to have a product which produces such easily measurable results!The tablets are easy to swallow, and so far I haven't seen any notable side effects beyond the vision improvements.
B0013OX9NC I just turned 48 years young a few days ago and I have enjoyed many years of good vision.  However, I just started using reading glasses prescribed by my doctor with just the faintest magnification.  I have only been taking these a month, but many studies (and my doctor) recommend adding this supplement to your daily routine.  The Jarrow brand is one that I trust and these are easy to take.  I will be continuing to order these from Amazon.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 softgels is an excellent product.They are very easy to swallow and if you are over fifty I think you should try them,They really help aging eyes. My husband had an eye problem a few months ago when he saw the eye doctor he said it could be the start of a detached retina. Taking lutein has really improved his condition. I take it as a preventative. A bottle lasts us a month. I will not stop taking it. I would recommend you try it.
B0013OX9NC Don't let anybody tell you that they can see just as well at 70 as they did at 30. It's a smoke screen. Everybody's sight begins to diminish with age. If I can get something into my system to assist in staving off the detrimental effects of age, I'm going for it. Jarrow Lutein is specially formulated to aid vision and comes in easy-to-swallow softgels. It gives me a feeling of insurance against macular degeneration, and I'm sure it helps. Anything you can do for your eyes is a good thing.
B0013OX9NC For those with a Lutein deficiency, this is a pricey, but useful product. I wouldn't buy it unless you're convinced that you need this supplement. Eat lots of veggies instead. :)
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Lutein supplements for a couple of decades with the hope it would prevent or delay cataracts - but it appears that strategy didn't work. I am in the mid phase of cataracts anyway - age 69. According to one web site, researchers found that Lutein and Zeaxanthin reduce the probability of cataracts by about 19% for men and 22% for women, which I agree is statistically significant.  However, 19% certainly isn't anywhere close to 100%. It appears I am in the 81% category. Maybe it would have been worse or occurred earlier if I had not taken Lutein all these years. The minimum amount of Lutein necessary for good results is cited to be 6 to 10 mg per day. So 20 mg in this product should be more than minimally sufficient.
B0013OX9NC There's 20 mg of Lutein per capsule, which is more than most of the eye-oriented multivitamins on the market. Doing some research on Lutein, it is naturally found in many greens such as kale, collard, and spinach. There's no conclusive data that indicates a lutein supplement/diet would help reduce macular degeneration or prevent it, and there's no data that indicates the supplement would actually improve your vision. Preventing blue light from damaging the eye is definitely important, and that is why we have sunglasses and special optics that filter out harmful UV A/B/C radiation.I haven't noticed any side effects from taking the Jarrow lutein supplement, but I also haven't noticed any significant improvement in my vision. I did note that it contains twice the dosage per capsule of Lutein versus the Bausch and Lomb Ocuvite brand supplement.Overall: 5/5 stars
B0013OX9NC There haven't been a huge number of authoritative studies on lutein supplementation, so it's hard to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks. A quick internet search turned up one study showing that by the end of 12 months, people suffering from age-related macular degeneration who were given lutein showed vision improvement, while the placebo group did not.The Harvard School of Public Health also published a study on the benefits of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts for men and women ages 45 to 75. They found that people who had the largest dietary intake of foods containing these carotenoids have about a 20% lower risk of developing cataracts than the people who had the lowest dietary intake.However, though these carotenoids are probably beneficial for the eyes, they are not without risks. In a study conducted by the National Eye Institute over a six-year period, researchers found that beta-carotene, another carotenoid, increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers. This raises enough of a concern  about carotenoids in general that I personally would avoid taking lutein in supplement format unless I had a very specific reason to do so, and was testing my vision to check to see whether or not I had reached those benchmarks.Now, about these pills specifically: when you open the bottle, it smells really disgusting. To me personally, it smells like old shrimp, but my partner thought it smelled like old cleaning supplies stored in a cabinet in the garage. In any case, poor reviews all around on the smell. Unfortunately, when I broke open the pills, they taste exactly like they smell. I'd recommend taking the pills prior to a meal, so that you don't burp up any of that odor.When I broke the pills open, I found that it was a clear gelcap housing a thick, pasty orange oil which stained my hands yellow. If you want to take lutein in and oil form, this is a good bet. The primary ingredient is marigold petals, which you may not know is used to color the egg yolks of commercially raised chickens so that consumers are fooled into thinking the chickens have a healthier diet than they do. The gel caps themselves are smaller than the average vitamin pill.
B0013OX9NC This formula of Lutein is exactly what my opthamologist recommended I take for vision support - one a day is plenty, too, which makes this a two month supply if taken daily, but I was told three days a week, or every other day was enough, so I do the every other day.
B0013OX9NC It's hard to evaluate supplements, but at least I can say I have not experienced any ill effects :)I'll report back after a couple more weeks. The pills are easy to take.
B0013OX9NC Safe and effective luctein supplement for those who need it.  The pill is small and easy to swallow as well.  There is a lot of research to suggest these have a lot of benefits for eye health especially.  Jarrow always puts out quality products.  Never once had any issue with their supplements.
B0013OX9NC I am taking Lutein to prevent macular degeneration as it has hit members of my family. So since I am taking it in a preventative capacity, it is hard to tell if it works. But this is cheaper than the Lutein than the grocery store brand. I have really liked Jarrow's products and would not hesitate to recommend them. These pills are easy to swallow and don't have any after taste. They did not upset my stomach.Lutein is important to preserve and protect vision and this is a high quality low cost way to get it.
B0013OX9NC I take a series of supplements as part of my diet and I've recently started to take this lutein for my eyesight. The pill is not too large and easy to swallow. You may not be able to stop macular degeneration from hitting you, but these supplements suppossedly help eye health and I'm willing to try them out. These softgels contain nearly the same ingredients that other eye health supplements have. I have felt no side effects since starting to take these and hopefully they are protecting my eyes!
B0013OX9NC I know many people swear by Lutein, but it has done nothing for my vision that I actually notice. Everyone's different I guess.
B0013OX9NC I started taking Lutein after doing some research into some intermittent eye problems I was having. I noticed an improvement within several weeks, continuing through to a few months.  I have also recommended this to a family member who has macular degeneration.  I'm not sure how well this works on simply \"aging eyes\" but there is growing positive research on the effects on degenerative conditions.  I would even say that my night vision has improved.  As for the basics, I found these capsules easy to swallow, with no gastric upset or noticeable ill effects. I also have a good opinion about Jarrow in general, so I was happy to find this product at a relatively good price and with the subscribe and save option and additional discount.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is something of a wonder product for your eyes and believed to help decelerate horrific age-related disorders such as macular degeneration. I've always had a bad eyesight and after a health scare a couple of years ago I've been very careful about what I eat. There are a range of studies showing the benefits of lutein and although you can find it in dark leafy vegetables, eating spinach and kale every day can get tedious. These tablets are a reasonable alternative and although you won't notice any benefits immediately, I've noticed that when combined with diet there is a gradual but noticeable difference. The soft gels are easy to swallow and incorporate into any morning routine.As an aside, if you want to look after your eyes, you can't go wrong with a daily dose of kale, spinach, carrots and broccoli - the combination seems to eliminate floaters and improve general eye health. Although my experience is only anecdotal, I'd highly recommend increasing your lutein intake if you're having any sorts of eye health issues.
B0013OX9NC I have taken other Jarrow vitamins, and I find them to actually contain the amount they say they contain (unlike some other brands), so I am confident that these Jarrow Lutein softgels have the Lutein they claim to have. If you are looking for a lutein supplement, the Jarrow brand is a brand you can trust at an affordable price.
B0013OX9NC I am not sure if it is the lutein rather than placebo effect or a combination of the two. I am highly suggestible. In the last ten days since I started taking these daily I have been enrolled in an online seminar intensive and having to spend 10-12 hours a day online looking at screens and reading reading reading.Usually in such a situation my eyes would be killing me but I have not had much discomfort beyond some dryness. I think they are helping. I have not noticed any increased clarity or color perception.I am dead frightened of macular degeneration and I am taking these prophylacticly for that.Web MD says it may be effective for preventing macular degeneration but the only thing is is effective for, for sure, is lutein deficiency... ha!Here is a short quote from that site so you can get some idea as to your relative danger of lutein deficiency:\"Lutein is called a carotenoid vitamin. It is related to beta-carotene and vitamin A. Foods rich in lutein include broccoli, spinach, kale, corn, orange pepper, kiwi fruit, grapes, orange juice, zucchini, and squash. Lutein is absorbed best when it is taken with a high-fat meal.\"Here is the link to the site in case you want to read further. [...]
B0013OX9NC Haven't quite finished 1st bottle and not sure if I've really noticed much difference - will know more once in finish the 2nd bottle.  No complaints at all.
B0013OX9NC I will definitely be ordering Jarrow Formulas Lutein again. As a woman of \"a certain age,\" I have been becoming aware of subtle changes of my vision. I decided to take lutein because of stories I've read in the news, and this product more than filled the bill. My eyes have become dry and irritated. Of course, there are multiple reasons for this to begin, however, noticing a decline in that irritation coincides with my beginning to take this product. Of course, I have no scientific evidence to offer, however, I know what I feel -- and I do feel better. Recommended!
B0013OX9NC Lutein is vitamin good for the eyes, this Jarrow vitaimin is extracted from marigold pedals, laong w/ soybean oil, beeswax and  mixed tocopherols.The softgel consists of  gelatin, glycerinm, nad waterThe recommended dosage is one soft gel per day.
B0013OX9NC My spouse has a degenerative eye disease and was prescribed supplements to help slow down the formation of secondary cataracts as well as assist in general eye health. Of course, like many physicians, he has his own line of supplement products for sale that tend to cost a fortune.However, unlike many physicians pushing supplements, he also provides the full follow-up testing to show whether or not it was actually working...and it was as evidence by the amount of plaque build-up and impact on the lens. So far so good. Of course, the cost still left a lot to be desired.When this came up for review, we opted to give it a try as it contains many of the same active ingredients in roughly the same doses. The Lutein combined with other eye enhancing supplements all in one formula for about 1/4 the cost of what was being prescribed in-house. Now, the physician formula contained other vitamins etc but many were of an inferior quality; for example, B12 in the form of cyanocobalmin rather than the better absorbed and higher quality methylcobalmin. Given the need for B12 in the eye, this was a serious consideration for us; why spend money on something that is inferior. So, we've opted to duplicate the primary substances in the physician formula with better quality supplements available online. This provide a critical piece of the puzzle and have noticed NO difference whatsoever in outcome.It does require taking a few more pills but 
B0013OX9NC I have been a fan of Jarrow Formulas Lutein for the past month. I'm in my late 30s and very near sighted.  I discovered that my eyes were not focusing correctly on objects or books at close distance.  Imagine my horror and surprise!  Of course, I knew these focussing issues were a sign of getting older, and I didn't want to just give into that truth so quickly. That is, I thought I may as well try to help my eyes out.  So I ordered Jarrow's Lutein, 20mg.  In addition, I also started a course of Bilberry supplements. I take one pill of each at dinner time.  So it's been about a month since my freak out moment of aging and my start on Lutein.  Honestly, my issues with focussing on close objects have lessened. I will continue taking Lutein, since I do think it's helping. And with the Bilberry supplement, I think I might be able to stave off bifocal lenses for a few more years.  Of course, all of my good results could just be the placebo effect, but I value my eyesight, and so I'll take it if it is. I think for the price you are paying for Jarrow Lutein, it's quite a value. Always be sure to talk to your PCP about your supplements regimen.
B0013OX9NC I'm approaching seventy years old, which is about the age that both my mom and her brother began to go blind from macular degeneration. Also, extreme nearsightedness runs in both of my parents' families, which explains why my eyesight has never been better than 20/450. I'm also diabetic (type 2, controlled), and to top it off, I'm only a year or so away from needing cataract surgery. So I take care of my eyes and see my ophthalmologist every year. Since I don't eat very much green, leafy vegetables or eggs - two natural sources of lutein and zeaxanthin - I asked my ophthalmologist about taking supplemental lutein/zeaxanthin at my most recent eye exam. He was fairly noncommittal, but he didn't reject the idea either, so I started taking an older men's multivitamin. The vitamin has only 250mcg of lutein, however, so I started looking for more potent sources. I've read a good bit on the subject, and the Jarrow formula with 20mg dosage is in line with recommendations that I've seen. The instructions on the bottle recommend taking one softgel per day with food, and that's the amount that I'm taking. I've also read that the only known side effect of excess lutein consumption is a harmless bronzing of the skin known as carotenaemia.I haven't taken the Jarrow lutein long enough to notice any obvious benefits, but I've used other Jarrow products enough to trust the brand. Being at great risk of macular degeneration and eventual blindness is a big motivator, and I feel more confident now that I'm taking the lutein/zeaxanthin supplement.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants that are known to help protect the eyes against oxidative stress, thus helping prevent macular degeneration and other vision problems. These compounds are found to concentrate in the eyes as well as skin, breast, and cervical tissues. These compounds are normally obtained in the diet through green leafy vegetables, which most people don't consume much of. For supplements, marigold petal extract is used to get the concentrated doses of these antioxidants. Jarrow's softgels include soybean oil, beeswax, and mixed tocopherols inside the capsule of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The drawback here is that this isn't suitable for those seeking to avoid soy and the gelatin capsule makes it unsuitable for strict vegetarians. A vegetable-based capsule would make this vegan friendly, and I don't see why Jarrow doesn't implement that since they do have a good number of supplements that are suitable for vegans. I find this supplement to be a valuable one and the softgels are easy to consume, though I prefer to break it open to ingest what is inside without swallowing the gelatin. I'm next going to try Jarrow's Vision Optimizer formula and see if that is better - that one uses regular capsules with a variety of antioxidants and herbal compounds (Lutein and Zeanxathin plus much more) without any soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are tricky. They are not regulated like traditional drugs and can make all sorts of claims. Take Lutein for example. It is supposed to be important for eye health and result in improved vision. But is this truly the case? And then there is the matter of psychosomatics. You think that the supplement has improved things when, in reality, it may be just your perception that things have improved. Sometimes it is our imagination that, in itself, caused the improvement. Please keep this in mind as you read my review of Jarrow Formulas Lutein.Having offered my disclosure, I can now say that I noticed an immediate improvement in my eyesight after taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg. Not eventually, not over time, not after-a-while. Immediately.Things were fuzzy in the morning for me. I had trouble reading small fonts when I first awoke. It took my eyes several minutes, perhaps a half hour, before the haze passed out of my eyes. That was before taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. Now I see clearly as soon as I awake.This is a truly amazing result from taking any supplement. Is it real or is it Memorex? I can't say. The improvement was rather dramatic and rather fast. I will leave it up to you to decide if this is a figment of my imagination or a real improvement due to taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. All I can say is that the improvement was noticeable and real to me. Of course, your results may vary.
B0013OX9NC LUTEINI received my Jarrow Formulas Lutein from the Amazon Vine Program. I spend the better part of a day staring at a computer screen topped off with reading in the evening. Recently I noticed that when I would look up I wasn't able to see clearly. Also, I found that reading small type was impossible with out assistance. It was as though my field of vision was pixelating. I do wear glasses as I have astigmatism in both eyes, but even my glasses were not helping.When I saw Jarrow Formulas Lutein, I wanted to give it a try. The soft gels are football shaped and go down easily. There is no unpleasant after taste. With 60 softgels a bottle, I feel it's a good value.At first I didn't notice any change at all. In the meantime, I shifted to less computer time. After only a few weeks, my eyes do not fatigue as easily, and I can read the small type on this bottles label without much effort. If you suffer from eyestrain you may want to check into this product. I certainly appreciate the difference it made for me.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are tiny but powerful anti-oxidants derived from the petals of marigold flowers. We have taken supplements containing these anti-oxidants over the years - my vision is sharper and more in focus today than it was in my youth.  Jarrow Formulas provides a good quality product in an easy to swallow pill in an economical formula - that's a winner in my book.Serving Size: 1 softgel daily, with food.Lutein 20mgZeaxanthin 1mgOther Ingredients: soybean oil, beeswax, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative)Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, water.No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.
B0013OX9NC Do you appreciate your eyes?  Do you want to keep them healthy and maintain good vision for life?What are your options?Eat Kale every day.  Try it, you'll like it. eheheh.  It only takes about 3 hours to steam a big pot until its tender enough to eat.  Add 3 oz. of olive oil and some Season All and it's not all that bad.Take Ocuvite.  It's an expensive supplement for eye health made by Bausch & Lomb.  Check out the vitamin formulation of mainly Lutein & Zeaxanthin.I like spending less time and money and achieving the same results.Most health conscious folks take multi-vitamins and consume foods and supplements rich in Omega 3, antioxidants and perhaps A, C, E and Zinc along with soluble B vitamins.If you are so inclined, all that's necessary is to add a Lutein supplement.  Many companies sell Lutein supplements.I am not a scientist with a complete lab so I have to find a brand at a reasonable price that I trust and hope that it is not made in China and filled with lead paint.For now, I trust Jarrow Formulas, at least until I discover a reason not to.
B0013OX9NC I've taken other lutein supplements, but Jarrow Formulas is more reasonably priced than most.  The pills go down easy and contain 20mg of lutein each vs. 10-40mg for other supplements.  I honestly can't say how well it works, but supposedly it's effective in maintaining healthy eyes.  Leafy greens like kale and spinach are high in lutein.  I think you'd have to eat about half a pound of spinach to get 20mg of lutein though.
B0013OX9NC I've never taken supplements before except for occasional multi-vitamins and am not a fan of them in general, preferring instead to simply eat a healthy diet.  But as a voracious reader, I had lately noticed my eyes feeling tired and decided to give this product a try.Lutein is a chemical which is concentrated in the area of the retina which is responsible for our vision.  Some studies have shown that lutein supplementation increases the pigmentation in the macula, and may help decrease the risk of age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts.  Most research studies have been associated with the elderly and not supplementation among the general population, but there also do not seem to be any harmful side effects to taking it.  (The only side effect I could find to taking too much was possible bronzing of the skin, but that's probably something I could use after a long winter and with an upcoming vacation at the beach!)Lutein is found naturally in leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale as well as the yolks of eggs, and although we generally eat pretty healthy at our house I'd have to admit it could be a little better sometimes.  The Jarrow softgels, which are just over half an inch long, get their lutein from an extract from marigold petals (one of my favorite flowers) and contain 20mg.  Other ingredients are \"soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.\"  The recommendation is for one a day and they seemed to go better when taken with a meal.  I hesitate to mention it but it did seem my eyes felt a little less tired when I started taking these, although I honestly may have only imagined it.
B0013OX9NC I started taking \"eye vitamins\" when my mother's sight began fading due to age-related macular degeneration (abbreviated AREDS).  The key ingredient I look for is lutein.  Unfortunately, the typical eye vitamin is sized like a horse pill, and I have trouble swallowing big pills.  These are not only sized smaller, they are softgels, which means they go down easy!  I am glad I found these.
B0013OX9NC I intend to enjoy active health and my physical senses well into my later years. So I take a lot of supplements (with my doctor's okay), in recommended dosages. Lutein is one for the eyeballs. It is purported to protect vision in the macula and lens.Recommended daily amount is one softgel per day with food. The source for this pill is marigold petals, and there is 20 mg of lutein per serving. There is also Vitamin E as an oil-based carrier, which is nice.
B0013OX9NC Each serving Jarrow Lutein combines 20 mg. lutein with 1 mg. zeacanthin. In a 2007 article in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Associatoin) Opthamology, Dr. John Paul SanGiovanni of the National Eye Institute, Maryland and colleagues discuss a six-year study that led to the conclusion that \"Study participants reporting the highest dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin were statistically less likely to have advanced AMD\" (Age-related Macular Degeneration, which basically means age-related blindness). In a Q&A; on AMD, Dr. Burt Dubow of Insight Eye Care in St. Cloud. MN says, \"There are eye supplements available that contain the essential elements found in dark green leafy vegetables -- primarily lutein and zeaxanthin. Taking these supplements as directed may help forestall the effects of macular degeneration.\"This is one of a number of supplements I take in hopes it will do me some good without expecting undeniable immediate effects (like when I take melatonin or valerian, for example). I get a tiny amount of lutein but no zeaxanthin in the daily \"adults 50+\" vitamin I take, so I think/hope I do well for my eyes by taking Jarrow Lutein.Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OX9NC Marketed to promoted eye health , Lutein softgels claim to promote macula health. My mother suffers from degradation of the macula , and this product was recommende by her eye doctor.The effects and impact won't be known for a while , but hopefully this product will stave off the deteriorization for a while.
B0013OX9NC How important is ones eyesight?  About as important as it can be!  I want my eyes to be as healthy as I can make them. Lutein helps to keep the eye healthy.  I was happy that the Amazon Vine Program had  Lutein as an option.  I will continue to buy Jarrow Lutein to help keep my eyes healthy.
B0013OX9NC On the advice of my ophthalmologist I have been using 20 mg of Lutein daily for about four years now.  This product is recommended for macula and lens health.  The bottle contains a 60 day supply of the softgel, easy to swallow capsules.  The ingredient list is:  Lutein (as esters) 20 mg, Zeaxanthin (as esters) 1 mg, soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin and water.  The label also notes there is no:  wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, peanuts/tree nuts.  Notice that this product does contain soy.The only reason for the rating of four stars over five is because the product I've been using for many years does not include the soy.  Other than that the two brands appear identical.  On the other hand, the price for this product is quite a bit less than the one I'm using now.  When this 60 day supply is about to run out I will have to decide which factor will carry the most weight for re-ordering.
B0013OX9NC Many multivitamins have lutein, but I'd like to be sure I'm getting enough of this nutrient, which is believed to contribute to eye health. We have all kinds of eye issues in our family, and I'd love to avoid getting them. I have one minor issue, and will update the review after using this supplement after a while, after my next eye exam. Meanwhile, this is an easy-to-swallow softgel caplet with 20mgs of lutein per cap.
B0013OX9NC These Lutein pills literally smell like horse manure. The size of the pill is small but I have not been able to get past the smell to regularly take it. I am not a great pill taker and easily gag. Per other reviews they do seem to work.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of the most essential nutrients for eye health, especially as we get older. A carotenoid, it works as an antioxidant in the retina by scavenging the free radicals produced by blue light. most of us probably don't get enough lutein in our diet, so the Jarrow Formulas version is a great supplement at a great price.I've been using this product daily for over a month. I'm not really sure if I can tell that it's protecting my vision. I do honestly think that it has been helping with my night vision when I biking, but I have no way to prove that. Hopefully it'll keep improving.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended lutein years ago when I developed a macular problem. Although I have never taken the Jarrow lutein, I have taken others as a supplement. I find theJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsto be an easy to swallow capsule with no aftertaste and it is available at a reasonable price. I will continue to purchase. The only negative for me is the gelatin capsule, but I'm willing to swallow that minor complaint for the benefits.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is an important pigment (carotenoid) that is important for visual health. There are studies showing that it is important to lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration.This supplement contains both lutein and zeaxanthin, a related antioxidant.Each capsule contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin from marigold. The capsules are small and easy to swallow. To those who can't get enough lutein and zeaxanthin from dietary sources or merely need more, this is a good supplement. I like the Jarrow brand and it's sold at a good price, therefore I highly recommend this.
B0013OX9NC This is a high quality Lutein supplement for a company I trust. I would highly recommend it for anyone who takes Lutein.
B0013OX9NC Don't we all want to be healthy?  Shouldn't we want to have products available to help us maintain or improve our health?  That is what we have here.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit I had never heard of Lutein before receiving this.  That wouldn't surprise many I suppose, but I am someone that is a strong believer in healthy supplements keeping us feeling better, and keeping the doctor away much better than the proverbial apple.  But I am so glad I decided to try it, for it has helped greatly with an odd problem I had with focusing my eyes in the morning.  I work from home and stay up very late.  An early riser and greeter of the sparkling dawn I am not.  Waking up late especially over the last 6 months has seen me having this odd, focusing problem where for the first half hour or so I seem to have a blurry type of double vision.  Very subtle and not all that alarming but definitely there.  A look online at the symptom just leaves one scared to death of it possibly being a brain tumor or diabetes.  But this is not something that lasts long or fits the various other symptoms of those frightening categories at all. It always clears up after a short time and doesn't return until the next morning. (The closet I came to it being something benign is dryness of the eyes after a nights sleep.  Eye drops upon awakening helped, but not all that much)...Enter Lutein, something I came across with excellent reviews that I decided to try, feeling I had nothing to lose anyway...  Well it has been about two weeks taking this now and I already have seen a very noticeable improvement in my morning vision.  I can't really find any info online that backs up my theory that this supplement is totally responsible for the success.  But I can tell you that since starting to take this once a day I have not changed my bedtime, continued the eye drops, or done anything else that would justify my morning vision seeing such an improvement.  And the problem really has gotten much better.  In fact it has gotten too where I don't remember every morning, or are really taking much notice of my focus being blurry upon awakening now since it has all but disappeared.  As for the brand, Jarrow products are one that I am no stranger too and take other of their supplements already.  They are always delivered fresh, quickly, and are reasonably priced.  I know this Lutein is advertised as protecting the macula and makes no mention of my particular problem.  But the many favorable reviews on this stuff does add convincing testimony to Lutein being very effective for a number of vision problems.  All I know is I am one of them now, and I highly recommend Jarrow's Lutein... : )
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein (20mg) is a duo of Lutein from marigold petal extract and Zeaxanthin, also from marigold petal extract.  Though Lutein and Zeaxanthin are considered minor carotenoids, they provide benefits beyond beta-carotene.  Specifically, they \"support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.\"  Like many supplements, there is overlapping benefit in the form of potential cardiovascular support.I took this supplement for 30 days.  Overall, I did notice some benefit to my vision but it is hard to describe.  I guess the closest thing would be \"everything seems clearer.\"  I did not notice any change in eye moisture - my eyes are still generally kind of dry, but that is mostly because I stare at a computer screen all day without blinking as much as I should.  At any rate, this looks like one of those supplements that I will continue to take / add to my daily regimen.  I currently use several Jarrow Formulas supplements and I have had consistently good results with them.  I consider them a trusted brand.
B0013OX9NC Some year back I had a scare when during a routine eye exam for glasses, my optometrist said that he saw evidence that I may be going through the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). He suggested a second opinion from another specialist, so I did it immediately. The second OD did an extensive in-depth exam, and said that it was not conclusive, but among the things that he suggested was that I start taking lutein on a daily basis. I followed his advice.ThisJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelscontains 20 mg lutein and 1 mg zeaxanthin, which is a bit more potent than the Ocuvite Eye Vitamin & Mineral Supplement that I've been taking (with 6 mg lutein and 150 mg of omega-3), and is a bit more cost effective, especially since I'm already taking omega-3 on a daily basis. The small amount of zeaxanthin in the Jarrow Formulas product is found naturally in foods such as spinach, romaine lettuce, broccoli, zucchini, and various greens, and is said to help a bit with AMD, especially with those exposed to heavy smokers.Macular degeneration is nothing to mess with, especially for one who photography is an important part of my life. At the time of my initial inconclusive diagnosis, I was a smoker, and the fear of AMD made me quit.There are enough studies and clinical trials out there that have shown that there's evidence of a relationship between low plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin, and an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Some of these studies support the view that supplemental lutein and/or zeaxanthin will help protect against AMD, and that's enough for me.So does this product work? Have I seen any miraculous changes in my vision? No I have not, but I use it for maintenance, and since I quit smoking a few years ago, the combination may be why my eye health has not degraded. The small softgels are easy to swallow, and I like the idea that this is in a stronger concentration than the original that I was taking at the suggestion of my optometrist.On a personal basis, I can only suggest that you discuss it with your eye care professional first, as your results may vary.TheJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgis a cost-effective product in a softgel form. At the one per day suggested dosage, you have a two month supply compounded to replenish the vital nutrients your eyes can lose as you age. It's a good way to help with proper retinal function and supp
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a substance found in many vegetables, but especially leafy ones like spinach and kale. It's known for its contribution to eye health, since it can be found as a pigment in the human eye. It is believed to act as a light filter, protecting the eye from damage. However, lutein has also been linked (less conclusively) to cancer and heart disease prevention.While lutein is typically found in multivitamins these days, the amount is often very small. Fortunately, Jarrow Formulas provides a larger source of lutein, at 20mg (from marigold petal extract). This is the amount consumed in the diets of some non-American population groups. The formula also includes 1mg of zeaxanthin, which is similar in structure and function to lutein.Jarrow Formulas has a good reputation and adheres to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices. Since supplements are unregulated, it's good to know that Jarrow takes the quality and potency of its supplements very seriously. I feel confident I'm getting what is on the label of the bottle.The pills are peanut sized softgels that are easy to swallow. In addition, the price is very reasonable. Since lutein is fat soluble, the recommendation of one softgel a day may be a little unnecessary. One every two to three days would be more economical. But, since it dissolves in fat, it's important to take with food.Overall, I'm impressed by Jarrow's lutein formula. I take a lot of supplements daily (including other lutein formulas) and am very impressed by the quality of the product.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein soft gels are a necessary supplement for your eyes.  I really enjoy Jarrow Formulas products and this one is no exception.  The lutein comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.  Be sure to take them with a small glass of water because dry swallowing them will give back a funny after taste.  I am starting to feel the effects of lutein after taking them for a couple of weeks.  If you are looking for a lutein supplement for your daily help then you'll want to pick up a bottle today.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 SoftgelsI've been taking the Lutein for the better part of a month. So far I absolutely have noticed a difference and in a good way. I was noticing a \"darkening\" of the vision in my left eye, which I haven't dealt with, with my doctor yet. I take a lot of vitamins and added the Lutein. There is a definite brightening of my left eye vision. Yes I need to get my eyes examined anyway but in the meantime it is amazing to see a difference. I will be reporting this to my doctor and see what else is needed. Sometimes you take a supplement and notice nothing, in this case I did and it's good. There have been no adverse reactions so I'll be continuing to take this formula with the zeaxanthin.
B0013OX9NC These soft gel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I experience no undesirable flavor when consuming the pill.The capsules consist of marigold petal extract; each tablet provides 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin. The other ingredients consist of soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols. The gel capsule is made from gelatin, glycerin and water.I am unable to determine whether or not my eye health has improved, but if these extracts contribute to macular protection and visual function, as the product claims, this supplement is a welcome addition to my diet.
B0013OX9NC Got these as a substitute for the Preservision that my husband takes. These are the same shape, different color and less expensive by a lot. I expect that they will be just as helpful. Easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC I spend all day at the computer and have sensitive eyes, so I'm open to trying almost anything to protect my eyes and improve my general eye health. After using this supplement for almost a month, I have noticed no discernible improvement in eye health. I don't expect a supplement to improve my vision. But this didn't do anything at all. No reduction in eye strain. No reduction in light sensitivity. Nothing.
B0013OX9NC I had the opportunity via the Amazon Vine Program to sample, Jarrow Formulas Lutein for eye health.  I've had severe nearsightedness since early childhood. I have to have specialty contacts ordered because no retail store carries my strength in contacts.  My worst vision was 20/875 and 20/825.  After, a six month mega dose regimen of Maritime Prime Pycnogenol in the late 90's, my eyesight improved at least 100 points in both eyes -as testified to by my eye doctor.  I have had issues which include diabetes, eye infections, corneal abrasions (imagine your eyes being rubbed with rocky sand), recent diagnosis of onset cataracts and other eye conditions of which I do not recall (though very scary).I have taken the softgels and noticed none of the negative side effects reported by some other reviewers such as distasteful odor, taste or repeating.  I have a very sensitive stomach, so if it bothered me, I would notice and report it.I do not see any improvement with my vision from taking this product.  That said, I do take a lot of prescription medication which may impact this product's ability to heal or repair the eyes.  Several of my medications impact the level of fluids in my eyes, nasal passages and create dry mouth.  Since drug manufacturers are much more inclined to report the positives and not the negatives - just look at the number of class action suits against pharmaceutical and medical device companies - then I can't truly ascertain the benefits of this product.I like the Jarrow Formulas line and I may consider continuing this regime for a longer time.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is supposed to be good for the eyes. I'm hoping this will help with some seasonal allergy symptoms  that can cause fuzzy vision and mucus. But this is yet another softgel by Jarrow that downright smells bad! We just got half a dozen different softgel supplements from Jarrow, and virtually ALL of them have a very distinct and unpleasant smell. Yuck! It doesn't encourage me to want to keep taking them or buy again. Clearly it's something in their manufacturing process. Guess I'll just plug my nose and keep downing these smelly things. Do they work? Who knows? I can never tell if supplements are worthwhile. It's been said that Americans have the most expensive urine in the world, from all the over used supplements.  Not sure which side I fall on that, but I do know I'll probably never get smelly softgels made by Jarrow again. Just my 2cents.UPDATE: just found a better quality alternative:Trunature Lutein (25mg) and Zeaxanthin (5mg) Softgels, 120 Count
B0013OX9NC My mom just had cataract surgery on both her eyes and her doctor suggested to her to take Lutein to help maintain good eye health for her.  Before the surgery she couldn't see well past her nose, and after surgery her vision jumped to 20/30 vision.  She's been taking the Lutein and mentioned that the pills are easy to swallow, don't seem to have any side effects, and she's happily enjoying her good vision.  Hopefully these pills will help maintain her good sight - she's enjoying seeing things clearly again!
B0013OX9NC I wanted my boyfriend to try this supplement because he has the dry form of macular degeneration and his eye doctor suggested he take PreserVision (the one he buys does not contain Lutein) and Lutein to ward off any further eye damage.  He's taken PreserVision for 3-4 years but has only been a few weeks on this.  So far he has no side effects from either product.There's Lutein 20mg and Zeaxanthin 1 mg in each softgel. Other ingredients are soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Each softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The softgels contain soy but do not contain, wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish or shellfish, or peanuts or tree nuts. The bottle claims to support visual function and protect the macula. Dosage is one softgel per day with food. From the research I found on WebMD it appears Lutein is absorbed better with a higher fat meal.Being that my boyfriend has had no side effects and this softgel has a decent dosage of Lutein, his doctor recommends Lutein along with PreserVision and studies say that Lutein works, I consider this five stars. Of course, according to WebMD: \"There is 44 mg of lutein per cup of cooked kale, 26 mg/cup of cooked spinach, and 3 mg/cup of broccoli.\"  Therefore, if you ate a cup of kale per day you would get double the dose of what's in one Softgel here.From my perspective, any Lutein supplement that does not cause side effects and has a sufficient dosage I would rate five stars because studies have suggested it is suppose to work.
B0013OX9NC I used to buy from Puritan Pride found these gave them a try work just as good and cheaper will buy again
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein seems to be an excellent choice for vision benefits. I've taken it for several months, and while the changes are subtle, they're definitely there.My vision seems to be sharper and clearer, and by some miracle, I didn't need a change in my eyeglass prescription for the first time since I got reading glasses.Definitely worth a few bucks to give your vision a boost.
B0013OX9NC I must admit that I like products from this company, because I have had good luck with them. This is another that I would recommend if you are looking to looking to protect or improve your eyesight. I offer that this is has been a good addition to my health regimen that over time has made a slight, but noticeable improvement.
B0013OX9NC I am a 57 year old female and have worn glasses for about 20 years. I am a real estate title examiner and spend a lot of time reading legal documents on top of loving to read a wide variety of books.  In spite of recently getting new glasses I began noticing that I was having trouble focusing on specific words or letters. I guess this is due to me being near sighted in one eye and far sighted in the other eye, but to me it seemed like my eyes were constantly jumping around. Driving at night was also becoming a problem with the glare from headlights. After taking the Lutein for about two weeks I was driving home after dark and was amazed at how clear everything looked and the headlights didn't bother me at all. When I got home I found something to read an noticed that my eyes could now focus on individual letters. I am definitely happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.
B0013OX9NC This is yet another Jarrow product which I have in the house and use everyday. But I don't use it for myself, I use it for my dog. Lutein is an antioxidant which helps the eyes perform well, and keeps them from slowly degrading. Lutein is found in the macula and the lens of the eye as well as breast, cervical and skin tissue. It is naturally found in dark green, leafy vegetables like spinach, collard greens and salad greens, etc. Since these greens are not really a big part of the canine diet, many dogs succumb to an eye disease called Pannus. To help keep my dog's eyes healthy, I give her one softgel a day, along with a few other supplements. It helps a great deal and I'll never stop giving her the best.I'm on a plant based diet so I do get plenty of Lutein from organic fresh foods but if I miss a day of dark green, leafy vegetables, I will use this supplement. Lutein has been known to decrease macular degeneration & cataracts and guard against too much UV radiation sunlight. Lutein and zeaxantin also use their antioxidant abilities to keep us free from free radicals, and may help protect against atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. I like the Jarrow brand and I feel these supplements do wonders. I can highly recommend them for yourselves or your pets.
B0013OX9NC The thing about preventative supplements is that you really won't necessarily see the benefit in terms of a dramatic improvement.  I didn't start on Lutein expecting it to have any noticeable short-term impact on my farsighted/nearsightedness, or those \"floaters\" that are an early indicator for cataracts -- and it hasn't.  The question is more whether a lutein supplements, for me, can forstall or prevent macular degeneration, or whether this little pill is just doing its bit towards making my country's sewage the Most Nutritionally Supplemented Sludge on the Planet.I don't know where I stand on all that, but after reading some study literature, I am having a relative with eye issues ask the doctor about lutein on her next visit.  As for me...I don't have a family history of macular degeneration, so maybe I don't need it, but I have seen some noticeable improvement in my (aging) skin over recent weeks, particularly around the eyes - weird, considering no change in other products I use, and guess what?  A web search on \"Lutein and skin\" uncovers a fair amount of research strongly supporting the notion that Lutein improves skin hydration and elasticity.Obviously this is just personal/anecdotal and I'd be skeptical, too, except for my own experience.  I do have to remember to take this with food, as either it orJarrow Formulas Magmind Nutritional Supplement, 90 Count(which I started at the same time last month) is causing minor nausea on an empty stomach.What I might not have continued for the sake of my eyes, I may end up keeping for the sake of my vanity!
B0013OX9NC Okay, I'm not talking about goggles here I'm talking about softgels.  Very small, easy to swallow, tasteless softgels.I was taking VISION OPTIMIZER BY Jarrow which was helping with my dry, tired eyes but stopped to try this instead.  Jarrow's Lutein formula has 20mg of Lutein, twice the amount found in VISION OPTIMIZER but not much else, as in, 1mg of Zeaxanthin, and that's it.  Now, I've read that Lutein is important for eye health but I don't know how much you need.  Maybe 10mg is enough?  Or, maybe you need 20mg or why else bother.  I don't know.  What I do know is that the extra added ingredients in the VISION OPTIMIZER formula seemed to relieve my dry, tired eyes better than the plain Lutein formula did.That doesn't mean I'm going to stop taking this.  I might end up taking both just to make sure I'm getting enough Lutein to protect my macula and lens.  I'll have to talk to my doctor first.  I just know I want to do everything necessary to protect my vision.
B0013OX9NC These pills aren't too big and should be easy for most folks to swallow. Supplements can be hit or miss, but I've found the Jarrow brand to exhibit quality and be effective for what they are supposed to be used for. My eyes are starting to not work quite as well as they used to, and I feel that taking this Lutein supplement does help or ever reverses that condition. This is all subjective of course, but it has been my experience. Jarrow appears to be a quality brand and I will continue using it.~ Kort
B0013OX9NC I use the Mayo Clinic website to get information about supplements and their effectiveness in treating medical conditions. They say \"lutein and zeaxanthin may...reduce the risk of macular degeneration.\"I also like the Jarrow Formulas brand, and at the current price ($9.09), it's a great deal, especially if you have Amazon Prime. Unlike drugs, supplements generally have little or no side effects. It's always worth giving them a try to see if they help you.
B0013OX9NC Been taking for a month now, once capsule a day. No reactions taken with food or on a empty stomach. I have horrible allergy eyes and I swear these have made a difference. I haven't had a itchy eye attack for over two weeks and with the pets and my allergies I have to believe these are making a difference. In front of a computer 10 hours a day my eyes don't feel as tired either- I will re-order, having great results
B0013OX9NC These are fairly normal sized brown softgel tabs.  They are not shaped like capsules but more like elongated pills, like maybe a small berry - and they are easy to take.  They go down well without dissolving before they get there.  They don't have any bad taste and no aftertaste at all.  It's very easy to take them, and forget them.I noticed recently that I'm having a very hard time seeing smaller and smaller print, and I know that smaller than usual optic nerves anyway, so I thought this would be something I could do to try to preserve my vision.  Lutein is cited in several studies as being a helpful nutrient for the eyes.I've taken it about 3 weeks but can't tell any difference, but also I can't tell that my vision is any worse, which could mean it's working.Amazon has a good price on this compared with other sites I looked at, and Jarrow is a very good brand that I trust and have a lot of positive experiences with.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with early age-related macular degeneration. Of course, I was shocked & horrified. How helpful the optometrist was to sell me a lutein product that would &#34;improve&#34; my AMD and supposedly it did. Because of the high dollar cost of their product, I researched on Amazon for an alternative Lutein product. This product has done an even better job of preserving my eyesight.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein Softgels promise health to skin, cervical membranes, eyes.  As I age, I've got 2+ shoe boxes of supplements in my daily regimen.  I have eye problems, bone problems, and cholesterol problems.  I've learned recently that supplements besides the popular ones like calcium, Red Yeast Rice, and Fish Oil can be helpful, and give support as well.  I have a doctor who has recommended that I take less of some of the popular ones, and give others a try.I rarely eat carrots, or leafy, dark vegetables, so these are good.More from Amazon:Amazon.com Product DescriptionLutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens; as well as in the skin; breast and cervical tissues.* Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation. Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark green; leafy vegetables. While the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day; other population groups consume up to 20 to 25 mg per day.* Jarrow FORMULAS Lutein is extracted from marigold petals. Each softgel contains 20 mg elemental lutein from lutein esters; which are naturally occurring; more stable and are well absorbed. Keep out of the reach of children.At a Glance:Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin that must come from dietary intake*Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein estersFor adults of all ages who are concerned about maintaining healthy vision*Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin.Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein esters.View larger.Two \"Minor\" Carotenoids Provide Major ProtectionJarrow Formulas Lutein is a blend of lutein and zeaxanthin extracted from marigold petals and then purified into crystalline form. These carotenoids (a family of brightly colored pigments in plant foods) are less common than their better-known relative, beta-carotene, but they appear to offer more and greater benefits to the body. In particular, lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown clinically to support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.* In addition, preliminary research suggests that lutein and zeaxanthin may support the cardiovascular system and help to maintain normal cell differentiation in the tissues of the breast, cervix, colon and skin.*Healthy VisionScientists believe that lutein and zeaxanthin contribute to the density of macular pigment--the component of the eye which typically absorbs and filters out 40 to 60 percent of damaging near-ultraviolet blue light (near-UV blue light) which strikes the retina. The denser the pigment, the more the inner retina is protected from light-induced damage. Lutein/zeaxanthin also helps limit blue light damage to the inner retina by protecting against lipid peroxidation and by neutralizing free radicals.*Considerable evidence shows the importance of lutein and zeaxanthin in supporting the health of the eye lens as we age.
B0013OX9NC After nearly a half century of better than perfect vision, I finally started having difficulty reading very small script on some bottles (like this one!) last year. It's a very minor thing, but I've always been very grateful for my vision, and as an art and nature lover I sure appreciate the minutiae they constantly reveal, thus I've been trying various foods and supplements to see if they can help. Lutein is among the most common suggestions, so I gave it a try.While I've noticed only a tiny improvement in the astigmatism, I certainly have found that my color perception is stronger. Hues are more complex and there seems to be a little more definition between shades. Blues and reds are also deeper. Is this due to the lutein? Impossible to say 100% yes, as I'm also doing more oil pulling (look it up, very simple, cheap and useful for many health issues) and taking other supplements, so it may be a combinatory effect, but I feel safe in saying that this lutein is making at least some difference in my eyesight. If your eyes are less than perfect, it couldn't hurt to give lutein a try for a month and see what you think, and think about what you see.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Jarrow Lutein for a couple of weeks, and it seems to be helping some of my vision issues. My vision has been getting blurry, especially early in the morning, and I get eyestrain easily. Since I've been taking this product both conditions seem to be improving. I'll keep taking it for a while to see if things continue to improve, or whether I'm experiencing the \"Hawthorne Effect\" (thinking things are better simply because I'm doing something different).
B0013OX9NC I guess I get enough Lutein in my diet because after a month of using this per the directions I have not noticed any difference in my eye sight.  I need reading glasses and this dietary supplement has not changed that.  I also haven't had any negative effects, just no effects at all.  Maybe I need to use it for a longer period of time, I don't really know.  If you need this type of supplement, then this should be a good choice.  Jarrow is known for quality supplements, these are easy to swallow as the pill is not large at all.
B0013OX9NC I have never had good eyesight, and I have noticed increasing problems as I've aged. I'm concerned enough to take this supplement. Like beta-carotene, lutein (in the form of Marigold petal extract) helps counteract the effects of aging on vision. Furthermore, lutein is an antioxidant and aids in cell growth and repair.One capsule a day makes it possible to get the necessary amount of lutein. The capsules are easy to take and have no aftertaste.
B0013OX9NC I'm still taking this supplement so I don't know the long term results, but my eyes seem a little less tired and sore, after being on the computer all day.
B0013OX9NC I use Lutein for my vision.  It seems to help w
B0013OX9NC The softgel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I have been taking them for over a month now with no adverse effect. Occasionally the fillers in supplements can cause me to experience stomach irritation; no problem with the Jarrows Formula. Another plus, they are reasonably priced and delivered to your door.I have not see any change in my vision, but I was not having any problems to begin with. On the advice of my physician, I have started taking Lutein along with Vitamin A to help prevent the development of macular degeneration. My mom suffers from this disease and it is known to run in families.
B0013OX9NC I've notice a decrease in my vision over the last year. I think it has a lot do with regular aging and looking at the computer screen more often.  For the last month I've started using Jarrow Lutein andHerbal Eyebright Extract - 1 oz - Liquideye wash.  The eye wash worked immediately to clear up my vision.  It felt like it removed a film that was covering my eyes (perhaps the increased blood flow).  And I think that the Lutein is helping to build up my eye health at a deeper level.  I've seen my improved vision stick around these last weeks and I feel that my eyes will only get healthier.
B0013OX9NC I started taking this when I first received it. But after a doctors appointment, my physician instructed me to stop taking them. As a diabetic, she wants me to get my sugar numbers under control first. This is why I'm having trouble with my vision. So until then, to be continued . . . .
B0013OX9NC I have vision issues related to an autoimmune disease.  As of now there is nothing the various specialists I've been to can do for me.All three of the various vision-related doctors I've been to have recommended lutein and/or lutein w/zeaxanthin to help slow my vision loss.I've been trying various brands for the past year and the vision deterioration slowed, but hasn't ceased or gotten better.I tried the Jarrow formulas lutein because I've had good luck with this brand in other supplements.  The softgel is easy to swallow, they smell unpleasant, but aren't intolerable.  I haven't noticed any difference after 30 days with this brand of lutein compared to the others I've tried.  As I haven't had negative side effects I will continue to take this supplement until my doctor says to do otherwise.I've gone back to juicing greens as that has proved to be the best thing I've done for my vision and results are noticeable fairly quickly.
B0013OX9NC What can I say about a supplement?  It works to quiet the flashers in my eyes and the caps are easy to swallow.  I have Amazon ship them to me every 2 months so I don't run out.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' lutein is packaged in easy to take 20mg softgels. The science around lutein's value when taken as a supplement to help prevent AMD remains inconclusive, but there are no warnings about side effects when taken in reasonable amounts over long periods. The packaging and promotional script certainly lead one to think that lutein may be a sort of magic bullet, but I remain skeptical after taking it for a week.I would agree that a week in not a sufficient time to see what effect, if any, this supplement will have, so I am remaining neutral regarding any benefits for me at this time. I plan to continue with the remainder of these capsules and will revisit this summary at that time to update any improvements I might experience.I cannot think that anyone with AMD will see any real, rapid improvement, but if this supplement at least conveys some degree of protection, it would be worth integrating into one's regimen as it is not expensive and Jarrow seems to have a good reputation regarding the integrity of its products.Update: It's now been 2 weeks, and so far, no changes in the way my eyes feel or in my vision.Update 2: Well, after a few more weeks of taking this supplement, I can report that nothing has changed. My eyes are no better, there are still tired after a day's work, and this product may have long-term benefits but, for me, there is nothing else to note.
B0013OX9NC This is good product. Getting what you need and what you asked for. Not combined in a multi-supplements where you also get a lot of unnecessary and potentially harmful agents as well.
B0013OX9NC It's easy to swallow.  I cannot tell if it has helped my vision or any of the other physical enhancements the makers say it might do.  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years for various things, but as I can recall, I've never noticed any improvement or extra anything.  But, if doctors are telling their patients to take a Lutein supplement to help macular degeneration or other disorder, then I suspect it will help.
B0013OX9NC I'm getting older, so this seems like a good supplement to help my rapidly declining eyesight.  I like Jarrow products in general, the bottles are not impossible to open, and the capsules and soft gels always arrive intact.  These are easy to swallow, cause no indigestion or other stomach problems, and although I can't say for sure they are improving my eyesight, I feel confident that this antioxidant is  good for my health in general.
B0013OX9NC My eyes were intermittently dry, and getting more so, more frequently. My doctor suggested taking a lutein supplement as a solution. After taking one of the the Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg every morning with breakfast, I noticed the problem going away. There was definite improvement after just a few days, and it's so long in between noticing any dryness of my eyes, that I'm sure it will eventually be gone entirely. While it continues to improve I continue taking the Lutein daily as insurance to make sure my body has enough of this to complete its healing process. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OX9NC Over-the-counter supplements don't always contain the amounts  stated on their labels, so I usually check the relevant ConsumerLab report (available online by subscription) before I begin using a new supplement.  CL tests confirm that JARROW LUTEIN does in fact contain the promised 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin.  CL also found this Jarrow supplement to be among the lowest-priced (for 10mg of Lutein) of its tested brands.Lutein and Zeaxanthin are thought to reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, both of which occur more commonly in older people.  Both conditions are treatable, but macular degeneration causes irreversible loss of vision in the central part of a person's field of vision.  If you eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, you probably don't need a Lutein supplement; however most U.S. adults get about 2mg a day from their diet, while adults in other countries get about 20mg.  There isn't any standard \"daily requirement\", but the 20mg in this Jarrow supplement seems to be an average recommended amount.I particularly like supplements sold as softgels, because softgels are easier for me to swallow than compacted pills (or even capsules).  This Jarrow Lutein softgel is rather large (3/8\" wide by 5/8\" long), but it's still easy to swallow.  How well it works, I cannot say, because it's basically a preventive supplement that scientists are still studying.  However, if you want to take a Lutein supplement, this Jarrow product is a good, economical choice.
B0013OX9NC I rely on my eyes for my photography work, so it's a no brainerto take out some extra insurance and keep my vision just as healthyas possible.  Sure, I need glasses, but I've never had problems seeingor driving at night and I want to keep it that way.I believe in the old saying, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound ofCure.\"  Especially in this day and age where drugs have so manyside effects.  It's important to keep your health and well being in yourown hands.Great product and I've been using Jarrow for several decades.
B0013OX9NC Started taking Lutein when various problems made getting dark, green, leafy vegetables difficult. The recalls of spinach, romaine lettuce and bagged salads along with the Texas drought had me searching for other sources. This nutrient is essential to avoid the vision stealing macular degeneration that runs in my family. I along with many people need their vision to be independent and taking this supplement helps when the actual sources aren't readily available.
B0013OX9NC I was advised by my eye doctor to take one of these daily when I was diagnosed with macula degeneration in one eye. I bought my first bottle, 30 pills, at Walmart but then discovered that I could actually get twice the amount for the same price at Amazon. I firmly believe that they help my vision (along with the professional treatments I receive). These are NOT a prescription but help with general eye health. Though they are not very expensive it is always nice to find a cheaper price. Who says Walmart can't be beat? Just go and check out Amazon.
B0013OX9NC As you probably know, antioxidants have a variety of benefits (fight free radicals which are the primary cause of cancer, promote cellular health, promote cardiovascular health, etc etc). So the more you get, the better.This Jarrow formula contains a spectrum of antioxidants. And the price is right - at only $4.50 per month (60 softgels for $9). I'm taking it primarily for cardiovascular health, but the extra antioxidants are a great long term \"insurance policy\" to protect against free radicals and other potential problems. I'm definitely adding this to my daily vitamin regiment.
B0013OX9NC I didn't have much hope for this Jarrow Formulas Lutein, because I had a severe allergic reaction to the last vision supplement I took,Jarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsules(which actually made my eyesight worse).  Thankfully, I never experience any negative reaction to the JF Lutein, and my eyesight started improving after only two weeks.  It wasn't a drastic improvement -- but where I usually have to zoom in when I'm browsing the web four times, I'm now only having to zoom in three times with my browser.  That is something I really didn't expect.  To say the least, I'm thrilled!
B0013OX9NC Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids, important to the functioning of the macular area of the retina of the eye and found especially in green leafy vegetables such as kale. The source for Jarrow Formulas lutein-zeaxanthin supplement is marigold petals; carotenoids are what give these flowers, carrots, and egg yolks their yellow and orange colors. Other ingredients include mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) which are used in various body processes.This supplement seems to be of good quality and the bottle I received has an expiration date of 09/14 which is 20 months from now. It contains 60 opaque gelatin capsules each with 20 mg of lutein and 1 mg of zeaxanthin.  It also contains soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Sometimes descriptions for products such as Lutein sound too good to be true. I was delighted to find the claims for this product were factual and true beyond my expectations. The label says it \"Supports Visual Function and Protects the Macula.\" Dry and itching eyes have been a problem for me for some time. When the supply arrived, I took the capsule per day as directed. On the third day it occurred to me that I had not had to use eye drops or had any itching at all. It is wonderful to have my eyes feel so good. I shall continue to take the Lutein from now on. I don't know if others will have the same results, but I am extremely pleased with the improvements I have noted to the condition of my eyes. I have already ordered additional supply, and I intend to tell my eye doctor what good results I have had with Lutein..
B0013OX9NC I noticed my vision getting worse in the past few years so when I saw that lutein might help I was eager to try a bottle.  This formula offered by Jarrow contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin which may protect the macula from degradation associated with aging.  If you already have dark green, leafy vegetables such as kale in your diet then you may already be getting enough of these two nutrients.  However, the bottle states that the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day and I know that I fall into that category more often than I would like.  I have not experienced any side effects from this formula and I have already felt some improvement in my vision.  I only have to take 1 softgel per day and it is not a large capsule so I am able to get it down easily.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsis a quality supplement.  I generally have the most trouble taking soft-gels.  But these are reasonable in size, about 1/3 the size of larger \"horse pills\" common for fish oil and Omega-3 capsules.  And while the long term effects of taking these is yet to be determined, so far I have had a good experience taking these.I am in my 3rd week of using the product at one capsule per day.  For the first week I took this, I only took it every other day.  After easing it into my diet I have taken one daily with dinner.There are a number of claims associated with this product, as with any supplement or vitamin.  This substance is reported to support visual functioning and protect the macula.  I cannot verify those claims.  In fact, they may not be verifiable.  How does one prove it is not protecting your vision?What I can say is that the pills had a strong odor, almost that of fertile soil.  I was worried that they might be extant, but I have been taking them anyway with no negative consequences.CONCLUSIONJarrow generally makes quality products.  While I can't verify the advertised benefits, I can say that it hasn't done me any harm.  So if you are looking to take a Lutein supplement, this one is well worth considering.  I will update this after longer term use.Enjoy.
B0013OX9NC I am a fan of Jarrow and after reading reviews of their various products I see that others are as well. I like to read and surf online for hours a day. Lately after a few hours the words are blurred and its frustrating. Also this causes me watery and sometimes dry eyes and I googled my symptoms and found that Lutein is helpful with eye site. I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels on Amazon and after using it a month I seldom have blurred vision at the end of the day. This product claims to help several vision problems but it is not Laser surgery and it doesn't claim to be. I am near sided and haven't yet noticed improvement on seeing far away.I can tell you that it does help with my symptoms, tired and blurry vision late in the afternoon/night. I am seldom frustrated with blurry, watery, sometimes dry eyes at the end of the day. I am a believer in natural rememidies and Lutein is made from the marigold flower. I found this quote interesting &#34;Lutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens.....Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation.&#34;I don't usually use quotes in my review, but I found this the best method of describing what I'm trying to say. THIS IS NOT A SNAKEOIL type remedy. I highly recommend Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg if you have any of these symptoms.
B0013OX9NC If one is going to use this combination of supplements to enhance \"eye health\", with the concurrence of an eye care professional, this is an easy product to implement into one's regimen.  They are not too large--the size of typical vitamin E caplets, and covered with the same plasticky coating.  I personally have no problem swallowing them, since they are about one half the size of the usual fish oil 1000 mg. bubble.  While they do cling to the plastic compartment of my pill dish, they do not adhere to the other pills in the dish, nor leak.  I have noticed no aftertaste, and have no idea if they are going to enhance
B0013OX9NC I just finished the bottle today.  I took this twice a day with my eye vitamin for a month.  I didn't notice a difference.I'm going to stick to just the eye vitamin since it was basically the same.  I'm glad I tried extra Lutein.  I was hoping it would make a big difference but it didn't.  It probably is still a good thing to take.
B0013OX9NC I started taking these Lutein softgels after my eye doctor advised me to start taking them. Now, it's not really possible to review the long-term effect of taking them - I'm told that in the long run, these may help your eyesight What I can review: the softgel itself.These softgels aren't overly large - good size, but not massive. They are the size of the average vitamin, but don't have any of the sharp angles that some vitamins have that make them hard to swallow. Instead, these softgels are super smooth and slightly rounded. Finally, there is no unpleasant taste to the coating on the exterior of these softgels.
B0013OX9NC This is a nicely priced Luetin supplement compared to other brands.  I will be buying this item when out of it.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow is a company that I seem to trust. The seemingly high quality of ingredients and wide variety of supplements they produce indicate to me that they are serious about the supplements they produce.I've been taking the Lutein supplement for 30 days and cannot say that my vision has improved in any way that I can discern. However I am confident that the Lutein is beneficial over the longer term for my vision and will help somewhat in slowing or helping to prevent macular degeneration. At least that's my hope.I'm had no ill effects taking this Lutein and it is now part of my daily vitamin ritual.
B0013OX9NC OK I admit I don't eat enough vegetables, but I am allergic to tomatoes, onions make me gassy and greens just taste horribly bitter to me. I decided to try these to supplement my diet and I have to say since I started I have been fealing much better.The eysight benefits would be a bonus, my vision is 20/10 in one eye and 20/80 in the other, so any help would be good.Overall, I think I will keep taking this one.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow brand, if you are unfamiliar, is well respected in the natural food community. e.g., it's sold at my local organic food co-op. These lutein and zeaxanthin antioxidants may be of particular interest if you are concerned about macular degeneration, and the like.Luteins are no joke. Macular carotenoid researchers are actively exploring up-to-date and evidence-based hypotheses and the supporting research data into the role of the macular carotenoids in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), vision, and cognitive function. You can search on the web for macular carotenoids.
B0013OX9NC I was disappointed for not seeing USP on the label, because this would give me some sense of knowing what is in each supplement. There are too many products that say they are the greatest since slice bread was invented, but they don't have what is listed on the label. I did a test by soaking one softgel in a glass of water for 30 minutes, and I found that the softgel did not dissolve after 30 minutes. I would not recommend this product.
B0013OX9NC I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Jarrow lutein is the first lutein supplement I've tried. According to Wikipediea, this particular supplement is \"one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids.\" You can get it only from plants.Carotenoids are micronutrients that have implications for eye health and cancer prevention. Some foods that contain them are sweet potatoes (which I consume nearly every day), carrots, and kale (which I consume every day). It's also found in egg yolks, and I consume 5 to 8 dozen eggs (non-factory type) a week (I never engage in the stupidity of discarding the yolk). The rest of my diet is almost completely fruits and vegetables (I do consume brown rice and raw oats).While I've never had my lutein level checked, it is almost certain I don't have a deficiency. Given this, what can I possibly offer regarding my experience with this supplement? I will show you in a moment.First, let's note that the typical American diet is woefully deficient in carotenoids. Look in the typical grocery cart, and this becomes sadly obvious.If you are on a grain-based, rather than green-based, diet you probably have a lutein deficiency (along with other problems, including low testosterone). Supplementing with lutein for a couple of months while you get your diet in order will definitely help your body recover from the effects of the lutein deficiency it's been through.You may not notice any difference, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. Adequate lutein is mostly a preventive thing, as far as I can tell. So the effect you will have by supplementing with lutein is you'll stop ongoing damage in its tracks. The cancer cells that were staying alive longer and longer in your body will die quicker and quicker, rather than morphing into a tumor. Your retinas will stop, and probably reverse, decline that was going on due to lutein deficiency. To protect the precious macula of the eye, you need lutein. Taking this supplemente provides that protection. So, good news there.Since my diet already provides me with more than enough lutein, what can I possibly tell you from trying this supplement from Jarrow? Several things:Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Jarrow does properly seal the bottle for consumer safety, but they do this intelligently under the assumption the customer might actually want to consume the supplement contained therein.Capsule quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart. This is bad. So I shook the heck out of the Jarrow container. No capsule failure, there. I've also seen capsules so thick that they don't look like they'll ever dissolve. I can pinch these and tell they aren't going to last long in my stomach's acid bath. Interestingly, these are a one-piece capsule rather than a two-piece. I don't know the implications of that for delivery; if you're interested ask a licensed pharmacist.Nausea effect. My major test was to try this with and without food, to see if it made me feel nauseated. Nope. I feel just fine, no matter when I take this.Dosage. If you look on Wikipedia, you'll see a chart showing how much lutein is in certain foods. I regularly eat almost everything on that list, including (in the summer), dandelion leaves (which I pick myself from my own yard). Raw kale (how I eat my kale) gives you 40 mg per 100 gms of kale. That's about 3.5 ounces of kale, which is about what I eat in a day. This supplement provides 20 mg. So, it's a safe dosage.If you are on the typical American diet, you need to replace grain with green. This is a foundational step in personal health care. During the transition phase, while your body is detoxing and nutrient absorption is probably encumbered, add a lutein supplement to your program. This looks like a good one, to me.
B0013OX9NC I love marigolds, they are so sturdy, cheap, easy to grow, and look fantastic in my garden. Despite this I have no intention of eating them!!!! I'm glad Jarrow researchers have done the work for me to extract lutein from the marigolds and package it in a stable formula softgel. I've been taking Lutein for years, and other than slight astigmatism which is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, my eyes are perfect and bright. This is now my formula of choice to keep my eyes healthy as I get older.
B0013OX9NC These small gel caplets are easy to take and had no bad aftertaste. I only took it a few weeks, but I honestly thing it helped with my eye strain, which had been severe. I'll continue to take it and update this review if I have other benefits from it.
B0013OX9NC I've had some problems with my left eye over the past year. Now being 20/30, I've grown more interested in taking supplements that could help prevent further problems with my eyesight.I'm not sure if the Lutein has done its job, but I'm been pleased with the product itself. The pill is tiny and easy to take. The instructions on the pill bottle say that you should take it with food, but I didn't feel any stomach discomfort if I didn't take it on a full stomach. I've had issues with many multivitamins in the past that make me fill queasy if I didn't eat enough food, but this wasn't a problem.I like the Lutein product enough to give it a chance after my current supply runs out. The product is easy to take and I hope it delivers the results that it says it does.
B0013OX9NC This supplement is pretty good.  The soft gels are a great size for swallowing and go down easily. I guess they are working, it's always hard to tell for sure, but they seem to be good.
B0013OX9NC My vision began deteriorating 5 years ago. My eyes had trouble focusing. I learned about a natural means of improving my eyesight called \"Bates Method\" and have been practicing ever since (The Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without Glasses). I also learned in another book \"Relearning To See\" about using blinking, shifting, and centralization. By putting the principles from Bates Method and from the book \"Relearning To See\" into practice, my eyesight began to improve over the years.I thought I'd try some lutein supplements since lutein promotes macula health and prevents macula degeneration. The macula is responsible for focusing. I am hopeful that the Jarrow Formulas Lutein will provide the necessary nutrients to the macula to help me further improve my vision.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor had recommended a Lutein supplement for my eyes/vision problems, then  in my research and talking to my general physician.. She thought it would be a good idea because of my high potential for arthritis.As many people know Lutein is good for maintaining healthy vision as we age, but it also lowers risk factors in getting arthritis and &#34;may&#34; even help with cardiovascular disease.I choose the Jarrow formula because I have used many other products by them and I have come to trust their brand because they have been using more natural ingredients and less fillers than other brands I have looked into.Most of their products have been soft gels,  this product is as well which makes it much easier to digest because I have a relatively weak stomach.In closing my vision has become more comfortable. I feel like I have been straining and squinting a lot less which may have been a placebo affect but my physicians agree that regardless of all that this is still a good supplement to add to my diet.
B0013OX9NC I'm not a doctor. I have no way of doing serious research as to whether these are what they say they are: both chemically whether they are as good a source of Lutein as they claim, and physically whether they really effect my eyes. I have used a number of Jarrow products, though, and feel pretty confident that their formula is a good one. Experientially, too, I have noticed something of a difference fairly quickly after using them.I read a lot and write a lot, and am on the computer for work far more than I'd like to be. I am near-sighted and wear glasses for driving and watching movies and such. When I'm reading, though, I have to take them off. I think that the combination of taking my glasses on and off throughout the day, looking at the screen and at books and at writing a lot of the time, all of that creates a lot of eye strain, and it's noticeable to the point where I have to just close my eyes sometimes for a while in the evening. I've noticed, though, that after taking these for a week or so, I was feeling less eyestrain. I had less blurriness. I could work longer. I can't, for sure, say that it's due to this supplement. Still, it feels noticeable enough that I'm going to keep using it. If you're like me, or for any reason worried about your eyes, it's worth a try.
B0013OX9NC It never occured to me that food supplements could do anything for my weakening vision, due to age.  I was sceptical at the claims, but decided that I should take advantage of the chance to try Lutein through Amazon Vine and I'm glad I did.  The improvement isn't exactly marvelous, but it's definitely there and worth the money to continue using.
B0013OX9NC On a routine visit to my eye doctor, he did the test where they dilate your eyes and shine a ray of light (directly from the sun, it would seem) into your eye so they can take a look around.  He pronounced that I have Drusen, which apparently are the first sign of Macular Degeneration.  After I got back up off the floor, I asked what the treatment is for this affliction.  He said basically there is no cure and the best you can do is minimize or delay the effects through diet and supplements with certain vitamins and nutrients.  He recommended switching from regular multi vitamins to a \"silver\" version for \"mature\" adults, adding Fish Oil daily and taking an eye-specific supplement with Lutein.  I stocked up at my local warehouse store and chose Ocuvite with Lutein but figured if a little is good, then more must be better so I threw this Jarrow Formulas Lutein into the mix.  It also contains Zeaxanthin, which was another ingredient in the sample the doctor gave me.  Please note this product does NOT have all the other ingredients of Ocuvite, Preservision etc since they contain Zinc copper and other vitamins.  Make sure Lutein/Zeaxanthin fulfills your doctor's recommendation before choosing this as the only eye supplement you'll take.  I'm taking it in ADDITION to Ocuvite.I haven't noticed nor do I expect any immediate effect from taking this supplement.  Frankly I'll only know if what I'm doing DOESN'T work and even then, it may not be known for years.  In the short haul, I'll say these tablets are an easy to swallow soft gel with no particular taste.  Wish me luck!
B0013OX9NC This product is a supplement for vision. However, after taking this product for a while, the effectiveness does not seem to occur. The tablets look normal in color and they taste pretty fine. It would be better if the manufacturer mentioned about the time it takes to achieve its effect.
B0013OX9NC I broke my glasses a few days ago, so went in for a prescription today for a new pair.  I felt like it was time anyway.  I had also been noticing that my old prescription, from two years ago, didn't feel right anymore, and suspected that my vision had declined and I might need a stronger prescription.The optometrist told me that this is not the case -- that my vision today is actually much better than it was two years ago, and that I needed a weaker prescription, not a stronger one. (This is the reason things had been looking distorted with my old prescription.)She also said that my eyes were focusing much better than they used to, and bringing together the two separate images into one image more effectively. Two years ago, the doctor has prescribed a prism correction, but I no longer need it.I can think of four explanations:1) I take Jarrow lutein every day (three capsules)2) I take astaxanthin every day (three capsules) (also very good for eyesight)3) I've been doing eye exercises.4) I eat organic/free range egg yolks regularly, which are also rich in lutein.There's no way of knowing for sure which is the explanation, or if it's a combination of all of the above.  But I have noticed that when I stop taking lutein (when I run out), in a few days I'll notice that it's harder to read fine print.  When I resuming taking lutein, my vision starts seeming better to me, within a day.  It's a dramatic difference.
B0013OX9NC I really care about my eye health. I read a book or two a week, and have been for many years. Needless to say, reading is very important to me, so my eye health is critical.  I started taking Lutein about a year ago, but only 6mg from a different company.  I have been taking this 20mg. capsule for a couple of weeks and like most supplements, it is difficult to access the effectiveness.I was diagnosed with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, which makes my eyes dry in the evening.  Lutein seems to help. I can say, I have had no side effects and the capsule is easy to swallow. I'm giving it 5 stars because Jarrow is a quality manufacturer and the price is excellent.I bet deer have wonderful eyesight because they always eat all my Marigolds!!!
B0013OX9NC I've been taking lutein/zeaxanthin supplements for many years.  These are less expensive than many of the other brands, and seem to work just as well.  I will use this brand again, and will also look at the rest of their product line.
B0013OX9NC Lutein, known as 'the eye vitamin,' isn't a vitamin at all. It is a carotenoid...a powerful antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, particularly leafy greens and those that are yellow or orange.  There is considerable evidence that when obtained naturally from diet, it can prevent loss of vision caused by age-related macular degeration, cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa.  It's found in the color pigment in the human eye, in the retina and the macula, where it serves as a light filter, preventing sun damage in the same way that a sunscreen protects the skin.You can forget the old wives' tales, by the way. Carrots are good for vision, but many vegetables are better.  And some cooked carrots are better than raw. The cooking process releases the lutein. Research also indicates that Lutein is absorbed best when taken with a high-fat meal.Researchers at Harvard found that eating 6 mg of lutein each day lowered the odds of developing macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, by 43 percent. Other studies show that adding sufficient quantities of lutein to your diet can cut your chances of developing cataracts by up to 50 percent. Getting that daily minimum isn't difficult: one cup of cooked spinach will provide 26 mgs.  All of the studies are based on lutein derived from  natural sources, as part of the regular diet.  Whether the same benefits can be accrued from taking Lutein supplements is not proven. But what the heck, it can't hurt.  I have compromised vision in one eye and am not going to risk anything happening to the one that's still in good working order.I did some poking around on the internet and found a list of lutein-rich foods (figures show amounts of Lutein per 100 grams).Nasturtium (yellow flowers, lutein levels only) - 45,000 mgs per 100 gramsNasturtium (leaves only) - 13,600Kale (raw) - 39,550Kale (cooked) - 18,246Dandelion leaves (raw) - 13,610Turnip greens (raw) - 12,825Turnip greens (cooked - 8440Spinach (raw) - 12,198Spinach (cooked) - 11,308Swiss chard (raw or cooked) - 11,000Collard greens (cooked) - 7694Watercress (raw - 5767Green peas (raw - 2593Romaine lettuce - 2312Zucchini - 2125Brussels sprouts - 1590Pistachio nuts - 1205Broccoli - 1121Carrot (cooked) - 687Carrot (raw) - 256Corn- 642Eggs (hard boiled) - 353kiwifruit - 122All of these options are fairly tasty, with the exception, of course, of the zucchini, which should be banned by any civilized society.Because the jury is out on how effective lutein is when taken in the form of a nutriceutical supplement, I can't rate this product in terms of efficacy or results.  But if you comparison shop and do some research, you'll find that the Jarrow products contain appropriate levels of active ingredients, the price is reasonable when compared to similar products with comparable formulas. They are known to provide high quality products using the latest technology. So, until we know for sure whether or not Lutein in capsule form does any good, I'm going to give it five stars. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I'm buying it for insurance purposes...I would rather err on the side of protecting my vision than risk losing what I have left.There is also some speculation that lutein may help prevent colon cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. More good reasons for eating pistachio nuts and fresh corn! And remember, for best results, the meal should include fat...so be sure to add plenty of butter to your corn on the cob.(Please don't lecture me about how good zucchini is for us. I don't care. It tastes like a damp towel. I won't eat it. However, if you have discovered some some miracle of cooking magic that makes the stuff edible, please share it. But I'm talking good...asparagus good, pumpkin good. Potato good.  Not crookneck squash good, because that stuff is  worse than zucchini.)
B0013OX9NC Well, I've reached the age at which a quarter of people show signs of macular degeneration and that average certainly doesn't improve the older one gets.  Since a daily glass of red wine to prevent this eye condition has been debunked (at least for now), I'm happy to have this lutein/zeaxanthin supplement, which, although not as pleasant to ingest as the wine, is certainly better than 3 cups of collard greens. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to try this brand of the supplement.  It seems to be quite satisfactory but there's really no way for me to know if it works, except by having my eyes checked annually.  So far I've had a clean bill of eye health.
B0013OX9NC One a night for two weeks and my vision has not improved. Maybe I should have bought the combo with Billberry or whatever it's called.
B0013OX9NC I think it is impossible for me to say whether this is helping my eyes or not.  All I can say is that it has caused no problems.  I was taking one each day, but then read on WebMD that \"Even high dietary lutein intake of 6.9-11.7 mg/day appears to be safe. Lutein supplements 10 mg/day for a year have also been safely used.\" and switched to 1 every 2 days as the 20 mg in each softgel pill may be more than I need.I don't take a lot of supplements and only ordered these because WebMD said they are POSSIBLY helpful with:Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Consuming lutein as part of the diet might help to prevent AMD, but it's not known whether taking lutein supplements works as well. There is also some information that taking lutein supplements (10 mg per day for 12 months) might help decrease symptoms of AMD, but more research is needed. Lutein supplements don't seem to keep AMD from getting worse.Reducing the risk of developing eye cataracts, when high amounts of lutein are obtained from the diet. It is not known if lutein supplements offer the same benefit.Given the low risk and possible benefit, I am glad to be taking these.
B0013OX9NC Ordered this because my doctor said I need to take it for my eyes.  I guess it works.  But I got a better deal at my local drug store.
B0013OX9NC I have nothing bad to say about Jarrow Lutein. I've found that it seems to work just as well as I would have expected, and there is no bad taste/aftertaste from the pill going down. It's easy to swallow, and the Jarrow brand seems reasonably priced (not the cheapest, but right about in the middle of the pack). As far as effectiveness, I've only been using it a few weeks now and I'm not going to say I've seen a drastic improvement in my eye health or vision, but I have no complaints and certainly haven't experienced anything bad from using it. Overall I can recommend this product as a seemingly solid Lutein supplement.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I take lutein for my eyesight. As I grow older my eyesight gets progressively worse. Lutein is meant to support good cell growth and slow the effects of aging on the eyes.  I hope it works but just using it for a short time so far it's impossible to tell. I can say that the pill is small and easy to swallow and I've had no side effects.
B0013OX9NC Eyes need lutein, an antioxidant compound found in tomatoes and other vegetables.  So enjoy tomatoes in your salads -- except that tomatoes grown in poor soil and under less than optimal conditions may not have enough lutein to do the job.  That's when a supplement such as this by Jarrow can help.  The fact that a small amount of zeaxanthin is also included is a bonus to protect your eyes.I've been using Jarrow supplements for about a year, and have found them to be helpful and have also found that their lists of ingredients appear to be accurate representations of what's actually in their capsules. I recommend considering products from Jarrow before going to those of other companies.
B0013OX9NC Macular Degeneration runs in my family so my doctor recommended that I take Lutein supplements to try to avoid the same issues.  These are very easy to take with no bad odors or unpleasant aftertaste.  They are not too big to swallow and do not cause any side effects.  I have found Jarrow to be a reputable manufacturer of supplements and their prices are usually quite fair.  Quality is consistent and superior to many higher cost brands.
B0013OX9NC I'll say right off the bat: I don't notice much, if any, difference by taking these. But I do trust the research, which says that lutein is very good for your eyes. So I take them regularly. I haven't noticed any adverse effects, and perhaps over time they will have a positive effect on my eyes.
B0013OX9NC I've used the Jarrow Vision Optimizer that boasts more ingredients:- Vitamin C, E, niacinamide, B1, B2, B6, Selenium, Taurine, Quercetin, Blackcurrant Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Gamma Tocopherol, Grape Seed Extract, Eyebright, Ginkgo Biloba, Lutein, Zeaxanthin.It might appear that the Vision Optimizer is better than this one (the Lutein and Zeaxanthin), but oh, there's something to consider before letting judgement fall.  The Vision Optimizer capsules are big and harder to swallow, and the serving size is 3 of the capsules per day!Also, the Vision Optimizer has only 10mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin.This Jarrow Formula, has 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin and the capsules are much easier to swallow and the service size is only one.So, if you need more Lutein, this is the one. If you don't like large capsules, this is the one.If you want a more comprehensive protocol, the vision optimizer has a wider range of ingredients that are believed to help the eyes in many ways.
B0013OX9NC This Lutein supplement is a great addition to a healthy diet: taken once a day with water, this is helpful for improvements in skin, eyes, and other tissues...decent price, good product, would recommend!
B0013OX9NC My eyes/vision used to feel &#34;just not right&#34; until I started taking this product. After about 2 weeks of starting with this product, my eyes don't bother me any more. The way I can tell is that I'm no longer thinking about my eyes / vision a hundred times a day! These days I forget that I sued to have an issue with my eyes. In addition to this product, I also use eye drops (lubricant) once a day.I have good vision but since turning 50, I have started using reading glasses.
B0013OX9NC I really do not know how this works, though research says it does. However, if you get Lutein, make sure it comes with a mix of Zeaxanthin. The two together apparently bond together to provide what our eyes need to grow stronger. As I said, I cannot see a difference yet, but I'm only 1/3rd through the bottle. I'm hoping it does something useful.I will come back to review this again, once I have completed the bottle.
B0013OX9NC When I take this Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  I can see better and my vision got clear.  When I forgot to take it one day or two...my vision get blurry....Then I took it and got clear in few hours.  I guess Lutein is very essential for our retina.
B0013OX9NC These  are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or aftertaste.  I believe that Lutein helps eye health - the evidence is pretty overhwelming.After 2 weeks, I haven't personally experience any improvement in my eyestrain/blurriness.  I was hoping for some improvement to the blurriness that sets in after I've been staring at a computer screen for too long.So maybe 3 stars for Lutein, but 5 stars for this supplement if you already know that Lutein does work for you.I will continue to take these because I believe the medical literature that it's good for my eyes, even if not for the specific blurriness issue.
B0013OX9NC It is a small palatable pill and rather easy to take.  As for whether it is useful for my eyes, I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working.  I doubt that the effect could be felt in a short period of time. I will give this a try and see if I can see better.
B0013OX9NC My eye guy recommended that I take Lutein, and use a supplement that has at lease 10 mg of Lutein. This has twice that, plus you get 60 softgels. Plus it's under $10, so it's less expensive and has twice the active ingredient than other brands. It's also a small softgel, so is easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC From time to time, I have taken supplements to help my vision.  I want to try to prevent my eyesight from getting any worse so I am open to trying what the FDA doesn't want you to know it works.  A few months ago my eyes would get tried after the long work days so I was thinking of getting something for my eyes again as I do not want to get a new pair of glasses yet.  I tried these and my vision is doing well, even after a long day.  While I cannot say these helped for certain, I am glad my eyes are doing a little better.
B0013OX9NC My relatives have serious vision issues as they age including glaucoma & macular degeneration. My own eye exams include the higher $ retinal imaging record as a preventative detection measure. Since lutein has been in my regimen for yours, the retinal images have been unchanged for the good or diagnosed as better.Improved absorption of lutein through more current technology is all good.
B0013OX9NC I'm in my 40's and I work on the computer for hours and hours.Recently, my eyes started getting terribly tired in the evening.  It was hard to focus and my night vision while driving seemed to be compromised.  I had an eye exam and my doctor said my eyes were in great shape.  He said some of his other patients were taking Lutien and why not give it a try...Well, I've been taking Lutein for several weeks and it HAS helped!  My focusing is better and things are so much less blurry towards the end of the day.  At night, my eyes are much less tired.  I am surprised and happy to have such a great response.  Placebo?  Maybe.  But, I'm not stopping these to test it out.  They have really made a big difference for me and I'm very pleased to be able to see more clearly and with less strain.
B0013OX9NC I did my homework when I decided on adding a Lutein supplement. I've been taking Jarrow's Lutein formula for over a year now. And I can tell that it helps my eyes because they get worse when I forget to take it! I trust this brand for purity - something you have to check out with vitamin companies.Important: The softgel has a great shape that goes down easy with no aftertaste.Take it and be healthy!
B0013OX9NC I tried these because they worked for my Dad. He swears they help with his near sightedness. So far I have not seen a change in my own vision or eye health though. Fortunately, I have not experienced any side effects from these either. Since they are easy to swallow and cause no ill effects, I'm going to try them for another month or two to determine if this is the type of supplement that must be taken for awhile before having an effect. Also, my ophthalmologist recommends this supplement.
B0013OX9NC i take lutein for eye health- jarrow is a good brand that i trust.  this lutein was at a good price and i believe it is a quality product.
B0013OX9NC Population studies link low levels of lutein and Zeaxanthin to higher incidence of macular degeneration. But the proof of lutein and Zeaxanthin supplements preventing macular degeneration is weak. Since you have only one life, and there are no other means with solid evidence to prevent macular degeneration, I would take these supplements if there is a family history of macular degeneration.Supplement industry, with its powerful lobbying, has managed to prevent its regulation by FDA and so I am always leary of taking supplements and when I do, I only stick to well known brands like Meijer, Costco, Walmart, etc trusting that they have interest in the quality control of what they put on their shelves.Jarrow makes lot of supplements and there is no way for me to personally determine the quality and purity of their supplements. Meijer brand of Lutein has 25 mg lutein and 5 mg of Zeaxanthin compared to 20 mg and 1 mg respectively in Jarrow brand, which as of the date of this review, is half the price per softgel compared with Meijer brand. Jarrow has 60 softgels per bottle (15 cents/softgel) compared to Meijer's 30 per bottle.So if cost is a priority, then this is a good deal. But quality is unknown. On Jarrow web site, I saw no proof of their quality control.
B0013OX9NC Lutein has numerous benefits for your vision. These softgels are the best around in price per mg and a way better bargain that what you will find in Wal-Mart or drug stores. If you're in the market for lutein this is a good option.
B0013OX9NC If you read the information on the bottle this supplement comes in, it tells you that it is not designed to cure, treat, or prevent any disease, though it does talk about how its active ingredient supports tissue in the eye, uterus and other areas. When you decide to start taking any supplement, it's important to know that you are essentially gambling your money on a potential benefit rather than receiving a guarantee. Chances are you can never know if taking such a supplement will assist in health maintenance. My feeling is that, if you are at substantial risk of diseases associated with the tissues such supplements are supposed to support, it may not be a bad gamble to take them. This is why I obtained this supplement.My family has a history of uterine and cervical cancer as well as cataracts. Though I do eat a well-balanced diet which includes food rich in Lutein (broccoli, spinach, eggs with yolks), I figure that with my family's history, a little extra can't hurt and might help. At a price of $9 for nearly a two month supply, this is a pretty economical supplement and it is easy to take. The gel caps are moderate in size and can be taken with food.No one can promise that any supplement is going to perform in a particular way for you, but if you have a family history of any of the problems Lutein might assist the prevention of (macular degeneration, cataracts, etc.) and especially if your diet is lacking, this may be a good option as a supplement for you.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit, I prefer Jarrow products over other brands. They're of excellent quality at a reasonable price, making them one of the best values in nutritional supplements around. The 20mg Lutein softgels are easy to swallow and don't have any odd odors or lingering flavors. They're easy to take and don't upset my somewhat sensitive stomach, even if taken on an empty stomach. If you're looking for a Lutein supplement to help keep your eyes healthy, Jarrow Formulas comes highly recommended.
B0013OX9NC I like the convenience and price of having these Lutein auto-shipped every other month. I take one daily for eye health but found remembering to get them and finding a reasonably price 20mg formula a hassle. Very happy with having them automatically show up every sixty days and getting a discounted price is great.
B0013OX9NC This spring I have been suffering with seasonal allergies that have been worse than usual, especially with my eyes being watery. After a bout this year with a horrible sinus infection brought on by allergies, that even after antibiotics hasn't completely went away, I've been taking vitamins more. Since my own personal diet lacks in the area of not enough dark, green and leafy vegetables and I have a job that keeps me indoors over 12 hours a day, vitamin therapy has been helping.After just one week of taking this Lutein once a day, I can tell the difference in my eyesight and the noticeably reduction in eye watering and eye fatigue.These vitamins are not hard to take for me, and usually I have trouble swallowing pills. They have almost like a softcoat on them which makes them easier to take.Overall, I'd highly recommend these to maintain the health of your eyes, especially if your diet lacks in green, leafy vegetables.
B0013OX9NC If age-related macular degeneration (AMD) runs in your family, especially late onset AMD, please consider this supplement.I first heard about it in various AMD publications years ago, that I poured over when a dear friend became legally blind due to it.Studies have shown that it to be beneficial, so many studies that there was a study to study the studies!!! If memory serves, it was the University of Beijing, but I could be wrong. In any case, the data from a number of studies was examined, along with carefully analyzing if the study has valid data, and it determined that there was a significant benefit for AMD.A minimum of 6-10 mg per day of lutein is suggested, I've been dropping a Jarrow softgel 20mg in a Vitamix smoothie that I share with my spouse.If you don't like kale, which has one of the highest concentrations per serving of Luiein and zeaxanthin, please consider a supplement.
B0013OX9NC I really like this brand, the bonus is also that the pill is small to take and easy to swallow. After taking these for 2 weeks, I have not noticed a difference. Not sure if I need to take the whole bottle? It can't be harmful so I will keep taking, and possibly order another hoping to see improvement.
B0013OX9NC The product is excellent for eye health. Lutein and Zexanthin is great for promoting eye health. So, this is a good source for those two important vitamins.But, I wished I had read the ingredients list closer, because this product DOES contain soy. If you have a sensitivity to soy, like I do, then you'll want to avoid this product.
B0013OX9NC There is no improved vision here, but after a few days, eyes are significantly less tired after lots of computer time, so it is enough benefit for me. Will keep buying for sure.
B0013OX9NC For those of us over 50 the first line of defense against macula degradation is having your eyes checked every two years (your doctor will probably suggest every year). They have a machine that looks in your eye and gives a colorful display that tells the doctor any signs or concerns. Once my doctor said we should keep an eye on it but two years later he said it hasn't changed and I look ok for now. So while I am not off the hook it appears I won't have problems for a while. And while there is no gaurantee taking a few supplements like this one may help prevent that test from getting any worse.
B0013OX9NC I have no complaints about this product. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I've had no adverse effects from taking them. But neither have I noticed any positive effects attributable to taking the supplement.When I try a new supplement, I like to have a specific goal in mind. Dry eyes have become a serious problem for me, and I'd heard that lutein supplements could help alleviate the problem. I've been taking this product for about a month now, and so far, no luck with relieving dry eyes. I'll keep taking it till the bottle is gone, but I'm not likely to purchase more.With nutritional supplements that promise to prevent future problems, you just have to take it on faith that you're reaping the benefits. There seems to be a lot of well-documented literature about the benefits of lutein and zeaxanthin to promote eye health and prevent macular degeneration. All I know for sure is that it doesn't help with dry eyes.If you've studied the claims and you believe lutein will help you, this product is likely to be satisfactory for you. The only exception would be if you're averse to using a product with soybean oil that is not specified as non-GMO.
B0013OX9NC I am doubtful of a lot of supplements that state they do this or that, especially when the company can't back up their claims with scientific proof.  Lutein supplements are the real deal.  Twelve years ago I got Lasik eye surgery; my eyesight was 20/200 in one eye; 20/400 in the other.  Lasik perfected my vision to 20/20.  I've been taking Lutein ever since and my eyesight has remained perfect, at age 62.  Of course, I can't claim Lutein was solely responsible, but I think it had a lot to do with this.  I like this particular brand because you only have to take one softgel that's easy to swallow once a day.  I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.
B0013OX9NC After having a bad experience with the new age fad of sungazing, I found lutein to be effective in getting my vision back to normal. Beforehand, I was starting to have trouble reading bookprint of whatever size for any length of time. Thanks to lutein, my vision has improved so it is not blurry anymore. Jarrow makes a quality form of lutein.
B0013OX9NC I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this item as the Vine program now insists items be reviewed within 30 days, but I'm happy with the product. There's no way to determine if it has or will benefit my eyesight or anything else in less than 4 weeks. I've tried several Jarrow products and do generally recommend them.
B0013OX9NC We use a zeaxathin product from Life ExtensionLife Extension Super Zeaxanthin with Lutein and Meso Zeaxanthin Plus Astaxanthin and C3g, 60 Softgel,as a part of a health program for vision support, so I thought I'd give the Jarrow Brand a try since it was available to us to try as a part of the Amazon Vine program.I like Jarrow Formulas, as I tend to do well with this brand because of the purity. This product has:No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts. It does contain soy.While it's a good product, after comparing the ingredients with the Life Extension Zeaxanthin, we plan to stick with the Life Extension product. It's got a greater concentration of zeaxanthin from two different sources, a greater concentration of lutein, and C3G that helps support night vision.So this one is fine, but not our first choice.
B0013OX9NC I don't think you can go wrong with Jarrow.If they offer a supplement, it works as described.I have tried many (20+) Jarrow products and I have yet to be disappointed.Give Jarrow a try.This supplement really works.Jarrow formulas are worth it.They come from top quality sources and they are and work exactly as described.
B0013OX9NC I take various supplements every day, and this is one of them. Based on research studies, which I summarize below, I added lutein to my plan. Lutein ia a naturally occurring carotenoid. It is found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and also in eggs and animal fat. Lutein is utilized by our bodies as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption.It potentially helps protect our eyes from damage caused by unstable atoms known as free radicals, which can interact with and break down healthy tissue. Lutein may also help to protect our eyes by filtering high-energy blue light. By filtering blue light, the pigment protects underlying cell layers from potential light damage.Also, oral or topical lutein improves skin hydration, elasticity and lipid content.Other research has found lutein can inhibit the thickening of the walls of carotid arteries and LDL-induced plaque on human artery cell walls. Therefore, it is suggested that lutein has strong cardivascular properties.One of the largest case-controlled studies has shown that high intake of lutein from fruits and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of melanoma. Scientists believe these xanthophyll carotenoids prevent melanoma by protecting the skin against sun damage. Korean researchers have found that carotenoids such as lutein and can reduce colon cancer growths. It is currently being studied for breast cancer inhibition.
B0013OX9NC I am not one to believe all the hype about something, and while I wholeheartedly believe in natural foods and  proper supplements made from beneficial botanicals, I know they take time to work. This is why I am in disbelief about how quickly the Jarrow Lutein worked! I (for the last year or so) have used magnified readers when using the computer for long hours, or reading smaller fonts in books or in poorly lit situations. I resigned myself to this new, middle-aged need, begrudgingly.Was I surprised, when in less than a week of use, I did not need to put my glasses on to work. I remembered to get them out of my desk drawer (habit) and never remembered to put them on because I just started working at the computer. No strain, no headache, after hours and hours!
B0013OX9NC I've started taking eye vitamins, even though I'm not sure if they are truly beneficial or not.  I am assuming they are, and these Jarrow ones are very easy to swallow and are nicely priced.  Eye vitamins in the grocery store and drug store cost a lot more.  In fact, they are some of the most expensive vitamins out there!
B0013OX9NC Not sure what I could update here after finishing the first bottle.8 more words required but I have nothing to add.Will update later.
B0013OX9NC At the insistence of my mother, who began taking Ocuvite about 8 yearsago and has excellent eye health in spite of a family history ofcataracts, I recently started taking eye supplements. Initially I wasput off by the cost of Ocuvite, especially since it only had 5mgLutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin, plus contained other supplements (like VitA & C) that I was already getting. Instead, I started with a storebrand combination gel tab - Simply Right's Lutein 25mg & Zeaxanthin5mg.I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try this Jarrow brand as part ofthe Amazon Vine program, but I plan to go back to my store brand assoon as this bottle is finished. There are a few reasons:(1) PRICE. I get more for my money with the store brand. My storebrand has 120 gel tabs per bottle and costs less than 60 gel tabbottle of this Jarrow brand. Moreover, my store brand contains 25 mgLutein and 5 mg Zeaxanthin, whereas this Jarrow brand contains less ofboth - 20 mg Lutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin.(2) GEL TABLET SIZE. My store brand's tabs are smaller. This actuallywas a surprise, since there are less active ingredients (mg's) in theJarrow brand. This leads me to suspect that the Jarrow brand containsmore filler & suspension oil. In addition, the Jarrow brand usessoybean oil, which I have been advised to avoid.(3) RATIO OF LUTEIN TO ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has a lower ratio ofLutein to Zeaxanthin. Lutein & Zeaxanthin appear together in natureand are used in combination in eye supplements. Ocuvite and my storebrand have a 5:1 ratio, whereas this Jarrow brand has a 20:1 ratio.Although higher ratios occur in nature, many eye specialists arerecommend lower ratios in supplements.(4) AMOUNT OF LUTEIN & ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has more Lutein andZeaxanthin per tab. Zeaxanthin is especially important for the centerof the the macula. As a result, many recommend higher levels ofZeaxanthin. For instance, the American Optometric Association recentlyreported on scientific evidence that suggests 2mg of Zeaxanthin dailyis needed for eye health. This Jarrow brand has only 1mg ofZeaxanthin, and my daily diet does contain the other 1mg.For all these reasons, the Jarrow brand of this supplement is gettinga middle rating from me, and I am going back to my store brand whenthis bottle is finished. I tried it, and I have no reason to doubtthat it's doing what it's supposed. Based on the research I've done, Icertainly don't think it's the best supplement on the market. However,I also don't think it is the worst. Not taking anything, for instance,would be worse.The American diet is deficient in Lutein and Zeaxanthin, so it isimportant to care for our eyes and to supplement our diet asnecessary. However, I'd encourage everyone to do their own research bycomparing ingredients and prices, even seeking out the advice of aphysician, before committing to a particular brand for the long-term.Moreover, shoppers also should also be aware what eye supplements areintended to do. Specifically, Lutein & Zeaxanthin will not restorelost vision, change visual acuity, or correct dry eyes. Instead,Lutein & Zeaxanthin help protect against eye disease, includingmacular degeneration and cataracts. There are excellent medicalresources available at Web MD and the American Optometric Association.Do your own research. Talk to your doctor.
B0013OX9NC My husband and I have been taking Jarrow's Lutein for the last several weeks.  These softgels contain 20 mgs of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  The floaters my husbands has in his eyes seem to be getting better.  In terms of protecting the macula I assume this is a product that needs to be taken long term to prevent macular degeneration as an older adult.  The cost if used daily  (as sold by Amazon) is $.15 per pill.  Bausch and Lomb advertises a Lutein/Zexanthin/Omega-3 version of Occuvite on television though I have not yet been able to find that triple supplement combination online.  This product is easy to swallow and has no aftertaste or other ill effects at least in our family.
B0013OX9NC My husband has been taking Lutein for years now since finding out it was supposed to be good for eye health.  He is very near sighted and had a detached retina in one eye, so he does anything he can do to keep his vision from getting worse.  He normally takes 40mg a day, so this bottle of 20mg, 60 softgels will last him a couple weeks.I don't believe that this product is something that will improve vision short-term; it needs to be taken continually.  With age, lutein in the eye diminishes and need to be replenished.Jarrow Forumulas seems to be a good product and the price seems good, especially with the subscribe and save.
B0013OX9NC Lutein (and Zeaxanthin) are medically known and with much evidence shown to reduce the risk of AMD (Age-related Muscular Degeneration) and cataract.Due to this reason, I have been keeping my daily intake of vegetables (with Lutein) at about 10-20 mg per day. This has also been a recommended intake for both eye and health benefits as Lutein is a powerful anti-oxidant.However, when we travel, vegetables tend to be a neglected dish and we are glad that with the Jarrow Formulas Lutein softgels, we are able to supplement it to our diet.The pill is medium-sized, has a slight odor and is easy to swallow. One pill carries 20mg Lutein and 1mg Zeaxanthin. A good product to bring during travels or as regular intake to supplement a high protein/low veggie diet.
B0013OX9NC For the last year and a half, I've been concentrating on doing everything I can to prevent my eyesight from deteriorating further. Lutein with Zeaxanthin is one of the basic components of my plan. Although I also take other products, I alternate the rest from day to day. Lutein is the only one I take everyday and I credit the majority of my improvement to this product.The Jarrow formula has the same proportion of the two ingredients that is found in nature when everything is working right. It is a small, easy to swallow capsule, no smell, no aftertaste, and it works. It is also safe, no side effects at even more than this concentration, and no drug interactions.I am obviously doing something right. In the 18-month period, I've had three sets of eyeglasses: the ones I had before I had to start taking prednisone every day. My eyesight was noticeably affected pretty soon after starting and the eyeglass prescription that had been almost unchanged for years became almost useless. I had to get new ones made that were a much stronger prescription. After my latest checkup, those were too strong, and I am almost (not quite, but close) to my old prescription.In addition to this Lutein/Zeaxanthin product, I also take bilberry, choline (a B vitamin) and, twice a week, beta carotene and the AREDS formula. (Note: the last two I take with restraint because both vitamins A & E can have side effects in excess and I'm uncomfortable taking 500% or more of something on a daily basis).My eyesight has, not only not deteriorated further, which was what I'd hoped for, it is almost back to where it was before. I am very happy and relieved, and I am going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with macular degeneration several years ago. I immediately started taking lutein (from various providers) and it seems to me there's been no significant deterioration in my eyesight, which leads me to believe it is beneficial. Of course, this is all so subjective. There's absolutely no way for me to know this definitively.The Jarrow Lutein compares favorably with other brands I've taken, and the price is comparable to what I usually purchase from Sam's Club or Costco.
B0013OX9NC The softgels, to me, are easy to swallow.  This product contains 20 mg of Lutein, which is more than some of the other brands, but also less than some.  Be sure to read the labels before making your purchase to find out the desired milligrams vs. price.
B0013OX9NC Almost ten years ago, my father lost his vision to Rapid, Wet Macular Degeneration.  He did all the right things.  He went to the best Ophthalmologists in our area.  But, unfortunately, he was one of the small percentage of people whose progression can not be stopped, even with the right treatment.  I learned through his diagnosis and treatment that Macular Degeneration is highly genetic.  Even though I was only about 40-years-old at the time, I started to take a much more educated and pro-active role in my eye care.  My own Ophthalmologist recommended that I begin taking supplements which contain Lutein to support my eye health.  For the past ten years, I have been taking a well-known eye care supplement brand; but I have always been bothered by the fact it contains other supplements which I already take for other conditions.  I have always felt I was taking more of certain supplements than I could ever benefit from.  Then, I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  It contains only the supplement I really need for my eye care, and not other supplements which I am already taking in other forms.  This is just what I have been looking for!  Thank you, Jarrow Formulas!
B0013OX9NC We tried the Jarrow Lutein 20mg, and there it is a fine quality product. Jarrow is known for its quality ingredients. The reason we aren't giving this 5 stars is that the increased dosage doesn't seem worth it. We normally take a lower dose (and therefore less expensive) and there is no noticeable difference in taking these. So I'd be hard pressed to say: \"spend extra for the higher dose\". But if you are new to Lutein, and can find these at a good price, by all means use them.
B0013OX9NC I have used several and still use Jarrow products. I seem to have had an allergic reaction to the Jarrow Formulas Lutein. This product is made from Marigold petals. My reaction was tightness in the lungs, small hives on my neck and swollen and sore joints in my hands after taking the recommended dosage for 4 days. I am not going to be too quick to blame this product, but every indication leads me to the Lutein. It could have been coincidence, some other external cause or this product. I take several vitamins, minerals and other food supplements including some from Jarrow. I have never had a problem with them and have taken them for from 3 months to several years. All things seemed to be the same except the addition of Lutein. I stopped taking the Lutein after 4 days, and 2 days later all symptoms were gone. Since everyone has different reactions to the same foods, etc. each must judge for oneself.
B0013OX9NC After my left retina detached I learned about vitamins that promote good eye health. Lutein is perhaps the most important. We have used Jarrow before for other supplements and trust the brand. I am hoping to prevent a future detachment by taking lutein daily.
B0013OX9NC I have been reading a lot about Lutein supplementation and have been interested in trying it for a long time. My sensitive stomach issues, however, always prohibited my decision to purchase.  I have been pleasantly surprised by these softgels.  I do not experience an upset stomach or heartburn as I have with many other supplements.  This is a very big deal to me.I believe it will take quite a while to fully realize the potential benefit of taking Lutein, but I'm willing to stick with these Jarrow softgels over the long haul. (Subscribe and Save is definitely the way to go.) The company has an excellent reputation and wide range of products, though the brand has proven impossible to find in stores - at least in my area.Like all supplements, some will notice a difference and some will not. (You can say the same with a lot of prescriptive meds as well.) Overall health, lifestyle choices (activity level, nutrition, etc.), age, and compliance with suggested daily use will all play a role the outcome.
B0013OX9NC Approaching age 60, and suffering from common deteriorating eye performance, this supplement is right up my alley.  After a little over a week, I think I am already seeing some improvement in reading performance and night vision.  The long term benefit is pretty widely accepted on this stuff.The lutein in the Jarrow Formulas supplement is extracted from marigold petals, and purportedly supplements the body as an antioxidant, acting in much the same manner as spinach (an excellent vegetable choice).  Lutein specifically combats aging and degeneration of the macula (delicate light/color sensing area in the rear wall of the eye).  As a general tissue health enhancer, lutein is also believed to enhance cardio and skin health and complex tissues such as cervical and breast tissue.Each medium size and easy to swallow Jarrow's softgel contains 20mg lutein.  Recommended dosage, one per day.Contains no gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish.  Interestingly . . . I have gotten used to always seeing a boilerplate warning on Jarrow Formulas supplements containers warning pregnant women, people under medication, etc.  However, there is no warning of any kind on this container.Jarrow has an excellent reputation.  Lutein has widely recognized benefit and this deserves to be a key item on my vitamin shelf.
B0013OX9NC In just 3 days I saw an improvement in my eyesight.  It also helped my dry eye syndrome.  Good purchase, and I have recommended it to a friend of mine for her eye problems.
B0013OX9NC My doctor actually recommended I try something for my eyes, so when this came up I felt it might be good. It seems to take the blur from my vision some, which is a good thing considering. For a while i had a lot of trouble with my nightsight and thought it was an issue of my vision getting worse or me getting older. Now I'm thinking it might be correctable and am thinking of starting to use these more regularly.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of those supplements which can't be accurately quantified in an informal way since it's a preventive nutrient. The claims for it suggest that it maintains eye health and promotes good cell regulation.  Thus, if you don't get cancer or suffer macular or retinal issues while taking it, it might be the lutein and then again it might be that you just aren't getting any of those things. Bottom line here is that anyone with a health problem that might lead to one of the things that lutein is supposed to prevent, might want to consider taking a lutein supplement.  I take it because I'm diabetic and eye health is a real issue for us.The Jarrow formula contains about twice the recommended dosage of lutein, and while up to about 11.5 mg a day is generally thought to be safe, I'm taking a capsule every other day to be on the safe side.  More isn't always better, particularly when you're dealing with a nutrient that's not water soluble. To risk being indelicate, you'll pee out any water soluble nutrients your body doesn't use.  You'll store the fat soluble ones and they can build up, which is why being cautious with dosages of vitamins A, D, E, and K is so important.
B0013OX9NC Sometmes when I'm tired or working late my vision gets kind of blurry, taking 1 or 2 of these almost immediately clears my vision a bit. Though I dont have any profound clinical vision prolem, I can't help but think this can also be a prophylactic
B0013OX9NC I've noticed that Vitamin A has a positive impact on my skin, so I was eager to give Lutein a try because, as they say, it's like a super vitamin A.To better test the results, I temporarily cut out my usual intake of Vitamin A supplements to see if the Lutein would do even better or worse. For two weeks I took the recommended dose of 1 capsule per day (with a meal). I did not see any improvements, although I did not see any negative reaction either. The capsules swallowed easily and my body gave no upset complaints to the supplement.After the two weeks, I decided to see if taking two capsules per day would make any difference. It did not, that I could see. No noticeable skin improvements and no upset stomach or reaction.Unfortunately my eyesight is already great, so I wasn't able to monitor any potential effects it may have on the eyes (which is its main benefit, as they say).Overall, I deem it about as good as Vitamin A in regards to supplements that improve the tone and texture of skin. Although I didn't notice any miracles, having stopped taking my usual A supplement, I believe I would have noticed a negative reaction if the Lutein was less effective than A, so I believe it was doing something. Since the price is great and Jarrow is a trust-worthy company (one of my favorites), I feel these supplements deserve a positive rating.
B0013OX9NC I have tried to rotate a lot of these Jarrow products, because my kitchen drawer looks like a drugstore.  I have just begun taking these and I haven't seen a difference in my vision. My eyes are ok in the morning and I only use glasses for driving and at night when my eyes are tried and can't focus.  We will see if these pills help me as I take them.
B0013OX9NC This formula has excellent amount of Lutein, 20mg, and price is very good, about 1/2 the price for same formula of 'brand name' in CVS.  Please take with food as softgels are fat-soluble.  I already take a lot of different vitamins a day, and was glad this addition is just one small softgel.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgAmerican Optometric Association says there is no recommended daily intake for lutein and zeaxanthin, most recent studies show a health benefit for lutein supplementation at 10 mg/day and leaxanthin supplementation at 2 mg/day.Lutein (LOO-teen) and zeaxanthin are important nutrients found in green leafy vegetables as well as other foods such as eggs. Many studies have shown that lutein and zeaxanthin reduce the risk of chronic eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.AMD and cataract incidence are growing. Worldwide, more than 25 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration and the formation of cataracts. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over age 55 in the Western world and the incidence is expected to triple by 2025.This is captured from the American Optometric Association website.  I wasn't sure how to rate something like this as how do you know that it is working unless you conduct a double blind study with statistically viable numbers over a decade.  Since I don't have a decade or population to conduct such study, I am dependent on my own research.  My ophthalmologist has recommended taking Lutein.  This product provides that at a reasonable price of $9.99 at Amazon.  The star rating is based on value for the money, it does NOT say this will work or is working since I have no way to prove that.  However considering the consequences of blindness, I will take whatever steps necessary to possibly prevent it.
B0013OX9NC After a 23andMe genetics test indicated an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, my ophthalmologist suggested that I add a zeaxanthin supplement to my diet.Will it help?  Beats me...and one person's experience is hardly definitive.  But as long as it doesn't cause any unpleasant side effects (and I haven't had any), I don't see any downside, especially when the upside is some protection against MD.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg are an excellent source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. As we age, our eyesight diminishes and isn't what it used to be. The combination of ingredients in this product are formulated to help improve and sustain the eyesight and eye health as we age.Knowing what I've witnessed many relatives go through all sorts of diminished vision and other eye problems as they aged, I'm determined to do what I can to avoid as many of the same problems as best as I can.I want to live as long as possible and have the eyesight to enjoy watching it all happen around me!
B0013OX9NC The \"typical\" American diet is deficient in many compounds. We don't eat enough veggies and we miss out on a lot of the good foods necessary to keep our bodies running at optimal health. Lutein is one compound sorely missed by many, unless you are a big salad eater. My eyes are already pretty bad (most likely from a childhood of eating crap) and I don't want them getting any worse. I plan to incorporate this into my busy (and sometimes veggie deficient) lifestyle.
B0013OX9NC After eye surgery I have had trouble with halos around lights. The doctor said it would probably take 6 months to have them go away, if then. I started taking this supplement and in less than a month the halos are hardly there. I will continue to take the 1 recommended capsule a day and hopefully it will continue to work.The ingredients in here are some of the same that are in green leafy vegetables which also help vision, so evidently this will add to any natural foods you are taking to improve your health.
B0013OX9NC After reading so much about Lutein and its Properties I decided to get \"Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels\" Lutein Supplements are use to Treat or Prevent Eye Diseases, such as Cataracts and Macular Degeneration known to be build up in the Retina and Lens of the Eye, Lutein is thought to Protect the Eye from Injury induced by Free Radicals. Even though I only been taking it for just a month I know I can see everything a little Brighter...Really! I was Amazed how Bright and Crisp Clear I can see everything, you get results within 3 Weeks, to the Point that I got Lutein Capsules for my Entire Family. I was surprised by the Size of the Softgels, they are a little Big for my Taste, but easy to Swallow. To increase your Lutein intake without the use of Lutein Supplements, include Lutein-Rich Foods like Kale, Spinach, Cabbage, Green Beans, Mangoes, and Papayas in your daily Diet. I like taking Lutein which is part of my daily routine intake Recommended!... Thank You D.D.
B0013OX9NC I received these pills from Amazon so I may review them for you.  I have been having a bit of a problem with my eyes, tired, dry and just feeling off.I have only been taking these a short time but I must review them now, but in this short amount of time they have helped me a little. My eyes are less achy and a funny thing happened I have always had a dark ring around my eyes, and this has happened with another product also,and it happened with this one too, the ring came back giving life back to my dull eyes. Since this product does not cause any side effects I will continue to use them.  I like the way my eyes look and beginning to feel.
B0013OX9NC In today's world, bombarded as we are with UV, pollution and etc, not to mention living longer, eye health is important. Lutein has been shown to be a effective tool for vision health. Jarrow is one of the most respected brands in the business. This is also a pretty good price and easy to take, with no nasty \"vitamin burps' afterwards.\"Looks like\" you'll want to get some, then.
B0013OX9NC I had to give up wearing contacts 10 years ago (even the brands made for dry eyes). A year or so ago I started taking a more expensive brand of lutein and it made a pronounced difference in eye dryness, so I could again wear contacts on a limited basis. I've been taking the Jarrow Lutein for 6 weeks and it seems to be working just as well.
B0013OX9NC This little softgel is about the size of a navy bean and it smooth and easy to swallow. The inside ingredients contain marigold petal extracts, Lutein and Zeaxanthin. The softgel shell is made of gelatin, glycerin and water. Even though there is no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg , fish/shellfish or peanuts/tree nuts, this is not a vegan product because of the gelatin. It is said to be good for the Macula of the eye and to support visual function. I hope it works, as I had a hard time reading the micro small print on the label. Take one a day with food.
B0013OX9XW I've suffered with muscle cramping, mostly in my legs, but also in other areas, for decades.Since I began taking this supplement, I have had fewer episodes of awakening in the middle of the night with severe leg cramps.I still have to use nitroglycerine periodically for angina but not as much as I was using during the month or so before I started on NattoMax.I haven't noticed much difference in my blood pressure.
B0013OX9XW In many ways Nattokinase is the roto-rooter of the circulatory system. Derived from natto, a fermented soybean dish popular in Japan, it is reputed to have clot dissolving functions.  Additionally, it is believed to support the circulatory health.My mother had a stroke and that type of condition runs in her side of the family. Although to date, I am free of those issues, I thought this might be a good preventative. The capsules are small and easy to swallow with no discernible taste or smell. I have experienced no side effects from taking the recommended one a day. Much harder to assess is whether or not I have been enjoying any benefits. Good health is usually taken for granted. But seeing the results of circulatory problems and clots in others, taking these capsules seem a small price to pay to avoid those undesirable consequences.Obviously, these should not be used it you are on any type of blood thinning medication. But this seems to be an easy and natural way for people with a predisposition to clotting and other circulatory issues to maintain health and viability.
B0013OX9XW So far from what I have experienced is Jarrow's products are consitent.Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, 30 CountJarrow Formulas NattoMax is a highly purified Nattokinase with vitamin K removed. Nattokinase is naturally occurring in traditional Japanese food (natto) fermented by Bacillus subtilus natto.NattoMax is concentrated without solvents. Each capsule offers 2,000 Fibrinolytic Units. Nattokinase is a fibrinolytic enzyme that supports healthy circulation by its effects on serine protease-mediated digestion of fibrin.*Its hard to tell super fast because vitamins are vitamins. These seem correct and honorable.
B0013OX9XW Natto is attributed to help reduce blot clotting.  As with any supplement, please seek the advice of your health care provider before taking anything.  Jarrow Formulas, who makes this product, advises that anyone taking blood-thinning products avoid this product.NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract.  Other ingredients are cellulose and magnesium stearate.  The capsule is made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.  The natto is extracted without the use of solvents.The product contains no wheat, gluten, dairy, soybeans, egg, fish, shellfish, peanuts or tree nuts, and is suitable for vegans.  While it doesn&#8217;t contain soybeans, natto is, in essence, a soy product, so if you are sensitive to soy, take note.  While teh label reads 'no soybean', natto is fermented soybean.The bottle contains 30 capsules, with a dosage of 1 per day unless directed otherwise by your doctor.According to studies, natto consumption can aid circulation, and deter blood clotting.  It also can help lower blood pressure, based on some studies.I began taking NattoMax a few weeks ago, after finding my blood pressure, while not high, was higher than usual.  After taking it, I have noticed my bp a little lower.  I am certainly not suggesting natto as an alternative to good diet and exercise, or medical care, but it is a good supplement to consider.
B0013OX9XW This is truly a Godsend!  Not only does this act as a blood thinner, but it is a good alternative to prescription drugs that make the same claim.  Naturally you will want to talk to your doctor before you start any supplement regimen.  That having been said, Jarrow is a trusted name in health related products.  The results you will get from this will most likely be good.  You don't tend to suffer from side effects from this supplement.  I have read accounts by others who have now started enjoying pain free lives and having blood clots busted up inside of them and become history once they started taking this.  I HEARTILY recommend it!
B0013OX9XW I have been taking this for a couple of weeks and have not felt anything noticeable. At the same time I have not experienced any bad side effects either. But this is one of those supplements where you need to take it consistently for a long time before the effects begin to kick in. And this supplement is vegetarian based with no artificial ingredients.
B0013OX9XW This falls into the category of stuff I'm not quite sure about, because there's no completely obvious test I can do on my own to see if it's changed things. It's not like I have my own bloodwork lab going on.There's certainly a lot of reason to believe that excessive clotting is a bad thing, though I'd probably be careful not to take this if you're about to donate blood or platelets or something, since you do need to do some clotting in that kind of situation. If you're concerned about stroke risk or similar issues, this seems to have some pretty good science behind it for why it's worth taking.I haven't found the pills to be gross or exceptionally difficult to swallow or anything like that which would lead me to say this is something to avoid, at least!
B0013OX9XW These are easy to swallow and don't have a scent associated with the gel coating. I can't really tell if it's working or not so I take off one star for that.
B0013OX9XW As you likely know, Nattokinase is an enzyme created from Natto which is derived from boiled soybeans.  Supposedly, it's a folk remedy for a variety of issues, mostly related to circulatory disorders.  In short, it's a blood thinner, although it may have other beneficial properties.Candidly, I don't &#34;feel&#34; any different, but I will assume that it's doing some good.  Supplements are quite hard to rate, but supposing that it works, it seems like a good product at a good price.  4 stars.
B0013OX9XW I've taken natto before for circulatory issues so I thought I'd try Jarrow brand this time. So far so good. It's not the type of supplement that you'll &#34;feel&#34; working. It also takes time for the effects to kick in. I'm taking it due to some poor circulation in different areas of my body (a hereditary thing). I haven't seen any positive effects yet - it really needs to be taken for at least 60 days for this kind of health problem, but will be back to update if anything comes up. In the past I've only noticed that I would bleed much more easily if I cut myself. It's also helpful for fibroids.
B0013OX9XW This is probably the best way for me to get natto - love it!  Vitamin K-free!  Goodness, I have plenty of supplements with K and don't need more.Natto is made from soybeans fermented with bacillus subtilis.  Some eat it directly on rice for breakfast and it would probably be a good test of my courage to try it that way.  I'm glad to take it exactly in the NattoMax form.
B0013OX9XW I can&#8217;t tell if this has helped or not but the Natto extract supports healthy circulation. I have diabetes with a lot of circulation problems so this supplement was definitely worth trying for me. I will continue to take it because it is just a one-a-day pill and is reasonably priced. I hope that overtime, it can make a difference.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is a mix of protein-digesting enzymes derived from fermented soybeans. According to some research, it exhibits a strong  fibrinolytic effect, i.e. it can break-up harmful blood clots and improve circulation.I take protein-digesting enzymes regularly as a part of my supplement regimen. This includes bromelain, papain, and pancreatin (which contains trypsin, to digest protein). Taken on an empty stomach, based on some human and animal studies, they may thin the blood, have fibrinolytic effects, reduce inflammation, lessen the severity of sports injuries, and even prevent the spread of cancer. Nattokinase is another valuable enzyme to go along with these others, except of all the enzymes listed, it may be the most powerful in dissolving blood clots.Since I am younger (35), very healthy (I run about 20 miles a week, eat well, etc), I haven't seen any improvement from taking this supplement. I have taken it along with my other enzymes on an empty stomach before running. I haven't felt anything from taking it per se. However, based on its benefits, I assume it is helping my body avoid inflammation, along with the other enzymes I take.Notice I have mentioned taking this on an empty stomach. Enzymes like Nattokinase will digest food. If taken with food, it will have that effect. The label says take with food, but that is wrong. For the positive health benefits related to circulation, take it on an empty stomach. This way, the enzyme reaches the gut and gets taken up into the bloodstream.One drawback of this product is the price. Other enzymes like bromelain and papain are cheaper. Since I don't have any circulation issues, I will likely stick with cheaper protein-digesting enzymes. However, if I needed them therapeutically to treat circulatory issues, I would definitely add Nattokinase to the mix.Overall this is a good product for a decent price (at least compared to other nattokinase products; all of them are fairly expensive as far as supplements go). I have found Jarrow supplements to be high quality for a decent price, at least when purchased at Amazon.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase has been shown to help with lipid profiles. Lowering LDL and Triglycerides and raising HDL.I trust Jarrow's products. I have used them often in the past. Nattokinase alone has been shown to take up to6 month's to see noticeable improvements in blood profiles but it does work. Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase seems to work faster.Improving blood profiles as quick as 30 days. You can look at a scientific study preformed by theDepartment of Nutrition and Health Science, Chungchou Institute of Technology here [...]
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase prevents fibrinolysis (blood clots/too thick blood) and thins blood. Jarrow Formulas makes this NattoMax 2000 without the use of solvents which I like. It does use magnesium stearate as a flow agent; some people seem to think that magnesium stearate is a form of magnesium that has nutritional benefits for humans but that is not true; it is merely a flow agent used to make it easier to fill the capsules and is considered a dangerous poison by many leading medical experts. If you can not find nattokinase free of magnesium stearate, you may want to try Jarrow Formula's NattoMax.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from a traditional Japanese food called natto. Many westerners don't find natto appealing since it is made from fermented soybeans and has a weird texture and taste to it. However, natto has been clinically studied to have the cardiovascular benefits of a blood thinner and clot-buster, to promote heart health and improve blood circulation.Jarrow Formulas has a great reputation for making high quality yet affordable supplemental products. NattoMax has the vitamin K removed since too much vitamin K has the potential to increase blood clots. I ordered the NattoMax to try out. I won't know the results for at least a few months. What I do know is that it's easy to take - just 1 pill a day with meal - and certainly a lot easier to take than raw natto.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is inferior to Jarrow Formulas Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase, which additionally to nattokinase contains also red yeast rice beneficial for lowering cholesterol, if with monacolin K.  Nattokinase has only a potential to thin blood, but the effective dosage is unknown.  Thus, nattokinase with unknown effectiveness is inferior to plain aspirin with known blood thining effectiveness.
B0013OX9XW I was sent these pills for free to review, but really how can one give a rational review? I took them for weeks, and felt nothing different. No better, no worse. I see Jarrow says they offer over 350 products. Who can afford to take all of those? How are we supposed to choose which ones are actually useful? Maybe they do something, but I don't have x-ray vision to see it.One thing I am not impressed with in particular is that these individual capsules can easily be twisted open with your fingers. With all the product tampering scares over the years, this seems like manufacturing to 1970's standards, to me. Capsules should be permanently sealed.
B0013OX9XW Actually I know why they removed the vitamin K.  People on Warfarin or Coumadin have their doses set to their current blood levels and cannot change the amount of leafy vegetables they eat or add Vitamin K supplements without exceeding the therapeutic window of their drug.  But hey, that is a niche market (five stars for them) and most of us use natto supplements because both the enzymes and the Vitamin K2.  Jarrow makes great products but my money goes to a nattokinase supplement with the full spectrum.Natto's vitamin K is believed to increase levels of activated osteocalcin and result in a significant reduction in fracture risk.  It also helps blood coagulate.  The stripped down NattoMax does help regulate fibrin. When fibrin accumulates in blood vessels due to age and dietary imbalances, blood begins to flow less freely which can reduce oxygen transport to heart and brain tissue, resulting in suboptimal function. Meanwhile, excess fibrin can make blood vessels less pliable and lead to elevated blood pressure. Even Vitamin-K stripped nattokinase helps to maintain proper blood viscosity, fibrin levels and healthy circulation.To sum up, if you are on blood thinners this is a five star product.  But see if you can work with your doctor to reduce the drugs and take full-spectrum nattokinase and turmeric instead.
B0013OX9XW I can report so far, so good with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax. I have had no trouble taking the 100 mg capsules and no unpleasant side effects.My wife eats natto. I won't kiss her unless she's brushed her teeth. My sons eat natto. I won't sit next to them until they have finished their meal.I can't tell you if natto is more odorous than the King of Fruits, durian, as I haven't traveled to Southeast Asia. From what I've read and seen on TV travel shows, durian and natto are popular with only a minority of the people in the countries from which these foods come.I mention all of this because my wife laughed at me when I first tried this supplement. She offered me a breakfast of rice, dried seaweed and natto instead.\"It is cheaper than taking it from a bottle.\"On that point she is correct. At a cost of more than $10 per month (there's only 30 capsules per bottle), some people might consider eating the fermented soybeans directly. I wish them luck with that as it is too smelly for my palate.I am going to finish out my bottle and add a replacement through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, which saves me an additional 15%.Rating: Four stars (I'd like to have more capsules in each bottle for convenience.)
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soy (natto), which is great for clearing blood clots and reducing blood pressure. It normally comes with vitamin K, another blood thinning compound, so Jarrow provides this option of getting the enzyme without vitamin K in case you are already on blood thinning medications. This supplement is safe when used as directed and it is one that is effective for what people usually use it for. Jarrow provides high quality at a reasonable cost. This is certainly an item that can help with specific health concerns.
B0013OX9XW I was very curious about Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100mg, but since I've been please with all the Jarrow products I've taken in the past, requested a bottle of 30.  In the test tube, red blood cells do not aggregate in the presence of nattokinase, and since natto is a product which isn't easily available to me, this option for reducing blood clots serves as a viable and more tasty option.  I have not been diagnosed with clotting, however have a genetic disposition and family history, so I'm adding this to my supplement regime.  The vegetarian caps are easy to swallow, I take one daily with a meal, and I've had no reaction or problem.  I'll be ordering the larger bottle to save some money.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an extract that comes from a process of boiling soybeans that have been fermented with a particular bacteria.It is thought to be a blood thinner so it&#8217;s often used to treat issues that affect the circulatory system such as high blood pressure, heart disease, varicose veins, etc. I don&#8217;t have any of these problems, but a lot of people swear by the use of nattokinase.I take it preventatively since blood thinning could protect against blood clots and heart attacks. Obviously, however, there are risks to thinned blood. So, consult a doctor and use care when using this product.I also like the price and the company. Jarrow is a respected manufacturer and adheres to the FDAs GMP (good manufacturing practice). This is important because some supplement companies can be shady. With Jarrow you know the product is high quality and free of adulteration.Overall, this is a great, reasonably priced product that has a load of benefits. If you have circulatory issues, consult your doctor and give it a try.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is a supplement that is vegetarian friendly.  Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been used for almost a thousand years.  I have been using the, for almost a month and I'm enjoying the results.  If you're looking to add some natto into your diet then I would start with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax.  Especially for vegans who are looking for a healthy supplement.
B0013OX9XW Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, I have added an arsenal of cardiovascular-friendly supplements to my diet. The latest is Nattokinase, which clinical trials has shown effective in achieving a moderate reduction in blood pressure. So far, only a couple of days into taking it, I will say that it seems to be helping, showing a couple of points drop since before I started with it. Time will tell whether this will be sufficient, or whether I'll have to take medication.
B0013OX9XW Even though my husband has not has his blood work re-done to see if this has helped any, I still wanted to write about it.  It is a good product in that the pills are easy to swallow and you only need one a day (unless you are directed otherwise by your health professional).  Also, the price is right -I got the 90 ct here for the same price that my local Whole Foods sells the 30 ct for!  Unbelievable.
B0013OX9XW I offer that my past experience with Jarrow's brand of products has been very good. In this case...I am not saying that it has not been beneficial, but it may be just too soon to tell.
B0013OX9XW Because I can't easily find organic natto (the food) I take natto in supplement form.  I am hoping that given enough time it will help to reduce or eliminate some of my health issues such as uterine fibroids, pain during ovulation & muscle spasms.  Jarrow like most of the brands I have found so far contain way too many fillers such as magnesium stearate & hydroxypropylmethycellulose.  Jarrow seems to have the average 100mg or 2000 FU of Nattokinase as other brands as well.  The only difference I've been able to find between the Jarrow brand & others is that Jarrow claims the Vit. K has been removed.The capsules are small & easy to swallow.I'm going to continue to keep a look out in hopes of finding a brand with less fillers.  I recently came across Enzymedica brand & when I finish with this bottle, I think I will try them unless I find something I think might be even better.  With the myriad of supplements I take, I would like to reduce the amount of &#34;other&#34; ingredients as much as I possibly can.
B0013OX9XW Since taking this product I have had once cycle and what is usually pretty heavy my period was lighter and flowed better.. Also recent trip to doctor shows perfect BP.. Lots of good research about this product, I received this for free in exchange for review but I will order again ..
B0013OX9XW Natto is fermented soybeans and is a popular food in Japan. This supplement is designed to help with circulation and the cardiovascular.The capsules have no taste and go down easy. I'm also thrilled that this is a supplement that vegetarians can take. It is reasonably priced and made by Jarrow, a company that has a proven history of reliability.This product may also help prevent strokes, and I consider it a good insurance policy to keep myself healthy.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking this for a number of years. It is an amazing product. Research it and then try it. It works.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme that thins the blood.  It is supposed to be similar to what warfarin, coumadin and aspirin do, but I would not stop taking these drugs and using the NattoMax without first consulting my physician.  My husband's cholesterol has been on the high side for years and he has only recently begun taking NattoMax so it is too soon to tell if it is helping to reduce his cholesterol levels or not.  But, I feel it certainly is not doing him any harm and the price is so reasonable.  Also, he only has to take one of these pills each day with a meal - usually breakfast.  Since I am required to write a review within 30 days of receiving this product it is too soon to get another cholesterol check done, but I will update this review when he does.
B0013OX9XW Good price and as always with Jatrow, this is a quality product.  Research the product before using if not chosen on recommendation of someone reputable.
B0013OX9XW There are a lot of potential claims about this supplement - increases energy, cellular regeneration, muscle energy & recovery, etc. What you have to keep in mind - Jarrow is a company that tries to stay ahead of the trends. There may be one promising study out there, and Jarrow will rush a formula to market. That doesn't make it bad necessarily, I'm just saying that much more research (effectiveness, dosage, etc) are needed on some of these claims.However, while NattoMax may have lots of unanswered questions around it, the basic ingredient Natto has a long history of cardiovascular benefits - circulation, blood pressure, and prevention of blood clots or stroke. That's why I'm taking it, and I think I'm going to keep it permanently on my regimen. The cost is low (only $10/month), the benefits are clinically proven, there is the potential for additional benefits, and there are basically no side effects. So I'm sticking with it.Hope this helps!
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract derived from fermented soy in each vegetarian capsule.  It contains nattokinase, a proteolytic enzyme produced by the prokaryotic organism Bacillus subtilis during the fermentation process.The safety-sealed bottle that I received has an expiration date of 09/15, about eighteen months from receipt.All of the supplements that I have tried from Jarrow Formulas seem to be of good quality, and this one is no exception.
B0013OX9XW I read up on this before placing my order.  NattoMax contains Nattokinase  which is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner and seems to have a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.  Nattokinase is a by-product of soybean fermentation.The Japanese eat Nattokinase all of the time and it is possible that this is the reason they live so long.  Some people with coronary artery disease with 75% blockage reported only a 25% blockage a few months later taking Nattokinase.I think more research is needed but Nattokinase has been consumed by the Japanese for centuries so it is generally considered safe.I'll put it like this: This is on my Subscribe and Save list in the 90 count.
B0013OX9XW I have been eating Natto my whole life. Natto supports both blood clotting and clot dissolving. This NattoMax has the Vitamin K2 removed and only the Nattokinase remaining. This then is suppose to help the body's own fibrin dissolving mechanisms. I like the function of this supplement and would much rather take it than a patented prescription pill.The freshness and quality of the Jarrow formula seems to be potent and active. I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas and consider them a leading manufacturer.
B0013OX9XW They weren't kidding when they said,&#34;natto is not for everyone. Some find its stickiness and strong smell unpleasant.&#34;  Not only do I wholeheartedly concur with that but traditional natto is made from soy which also is loaded with phytoestrogens, which I certainly want to avoid! * Besides it tastes just awful!They did studies that showed rats with carotid artery blockages when dosed with nattokinase regained 62% of blood flow, where others treated with plasmin only regained j15.8%.Other blood substances helpful to vascular well being were incresaed after ingesting nattokinase!Nattokinase helps keep blood vessels clear because its enzymes have been shown to greatly encourage cardiovascular health by restoring normal blood flow because this formula has the vitamin K removed from it.Again, only 4 stars as it contains magnesium stearate, something that most supplement companies add to their formulas but is counterproductive to good health, arghhhh!
B0013OX9XW The same substance can be found in a Japanese food called natto.Natto is a fermented soybean product. Now I love it. Many do not. It is pungent. Think &#34;stinky cheese&#34;.It's great on noodles with some tamari.However, it's hard to make safely. I use a large yogurt maker to keep the temperature right while the natto innoculent grows over the fresh cooked soybeans. It works most of the time, but there is a high rate of spoilage.That's where NottoMax comes in.Get the same health benefits without the hassle of making natto every week.WebMD reports that it has been used for:*Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is some evidence that taking a specific combination product (Flite Tabs) might decrease the chance of getting a blood clot in the legs during long plane flights. This product combines a blend of 150 mg of nattokinase plus pycnogenol. Two capsules are taken 2 hours before the flight and then again 6 hours later.*Heart disease.*Stroke.*Angina.*&#8220;Hardening of the ateries&#8221; (atherosclerosis).*Hemorrhoids.*Poor circulation.*Varicose veins.*Peripheral artery disease (PAD).*Pain.*Fibromyalgia.*Chronic fatigue syndrome.*Endometriosis.*Uterine fibroids.*Muscle spasms.*High blood pressure.*Infertility.*Cancer.*Beriberi.*Other conditions.WebMD notes that more studies need to be done to confirm effectiveness for any of those ailments.Bottom line, Jarrow makes great quality suppliments. If you want to explore nattokinase for any of those ailments, I suggest you get it from Jarrow.
B0013OX9XW I'm very happy about the results I've had since taking this.  I'm especially thankful for the gr
B0013OX9XW Several years ago, during an extended visit to Japan, I discovered natto.  Yuck!  I had the usual American reaction to Natto, spitting it out as fast as possible within the Japanese bounds of good manners.  What I could not have imagined at the time was the almost miraculous effects of natto uncovered in Western laboratories.  Not only does this substance (fermented beans) keep veins and arteries open, but recent research shows that it can also clear areas of clogged calcium and cells.  That's for me.I've been taking this substance with ease only because of the capsules surrounding it.  I cannot say I've experienced any dramatic effects, but research papers I've read indicate a longer time of usage than the three weeks I've been taking it.  I'll be patient because of the laboratory research .
B0013OX9XW It is hard to &#34;rate&#34; the effectiveness of a product as the benefits might not be realized for years. This one looks promising though. Used for centuries in Japan, this seems to help the circulation system that could prevent blood clots. I would like to see more studies done, but Jarrow is a trustworthy manufacturer of supplements, so I can recommend this.
B0013OX9XW I take a variety of supplements, from vitamins to fish oil, krill oil and it seems like everything in-between. Both my parents died pretty young, so I'm doing what I can to break that trend. Part of the plan is heart health.  Reading and researching kept turning up Nattokinase , a natural result of soybean fermentation. Nattokinase is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner, and many experts think it's good for the cardiovascular system. It's one of those natural things that's been used in the orient for centuries.  Is it doing any good? Who can say - I feel great and I'm still here :-)
B0013OX9XW This is a really interesting heart health supplement.  I could be wrong, but I think this has helped lower my blood pressure a little.  As you can imagine, I am impressed!This product also comes in a bottle with 90 capsules, which actually is much more economical per tablet (at the time of my writing, for about $5 more one can get three times more).
B0013OX9XW This will thin your blood naturally and maybe get rid of your blood clots.  .  So if you're already on a thinner you will probably want to talk to your doctor before starting on Nattomax and maybe get it tested occasionally by your doctor after taking it.  This version of Nattomax has vitamin k removed, so it doesn't affect any other thinners you might be on.  I take one in the morning and one at night.Hoping to get off the doctor prescribed blood thinners permanently.
B0013OX9XW I know the great health benefits of eating natto and have been eating it as often as my wife allows me, since she doesn&#8217;t like the smell.  Now I can get the same benefit by taking this pill without annoying my wife.
B0013OX9XW I have not noticed any negative side effects.  I take this with meals to prevent nausea.  I haven't seen any positive effects yet, but I just started to take this.  I will update my review at a later date, but so far it appears to be a great product.
B0013OX9XW Where to begin? Well, go read the description and decide from there. This supplement seems to provide quite a number of health benefits all rolled into one convenient product. Like all Jarrow Formulas products, this one is consistent and appears to be of excellent quality. There is little odor, no unpleasant or lingering taste, and it is very easy to swallow. Unlike most Jarrow products, this one causes mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach, so I'd advise to always take these with some food if you have a sensitive stomach.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking these Jarrow Formulas NattoMax supplements for about 3 weeks.  Prior to being offered this product by the Amazon Vine program, I had never heard of this particular supplement.My extremities are constantly cold, even in warm weather.  I often sit at my desk at work with lightweight gloves on, and I usually sleep with heavy socks.  In the last couple of weeks, I've noticed a big improvement with both of those problems.  It's too soon to tell whether it's a coincidence, or this supplement helping.  The price of these is fairly reasonable, and I plan on ordering another bottle of them.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow is so very reliable with their supplements.  The quality and reliability is always there.  This is a very good Natto supplement.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is the non-nasty way to consume the health benefits of natto. I apologize if I insult anyone's taste for natto.I cannot tell the affects it has had internally, but I feel about the same. I still think it is worth taking because of the health-related claims of natto.If I could figure out one more way to use natto in a sentence...
B0013OX9XW I am not sure if it was this product or not, but my blood pressure is in better control when taking this.  Did;t notice other benefits and don;t know if it would effect everyone the same.
B0013OX9XW When I was in massage therapy school, I had to take nutrition classes.  My instructor was a huge fan of nattokinase but, as far as I knew, the only way to get the benefit was by eating natto.  I am an adventurous spirit, but I could never get past the sliminess of natto.  YUCK.  So this was an interesting alternative.  I am very healthy and do not take blood thinners, but I do have issues with varicose veins.  Maybe it is a placebo effect, but I honestly feel like I have less pain when I take this.  Great supplement for anyone with blood or circulatory concerns and is definitely easier to take than the real food alternative.
B0013OX9XW The explanation of the mechanism by which this Nattokinase supplement works is a bit technical, and all I would be doing is parroting what I've read elsewhere . . . so I won't.  I do recommend looking at the write-up on the Amazon Product Description Page.  I have read that particular propaganda on this supplement and am positively influenced.As an aging male (quite common nowadays), I have the typical issues with high blood pressure  and deteriorating circulation.  I also have a family history involving clotting and circulation issues.  I try to minimize, and eliminate where possible, use of prescription drugs, and taking targeted supplements has been a real success in this quest.  After having read the benefits and studies on Nattokinase, taking this supplement is a no-brainer for me.So in addition to taking my array of supplements, which saliently include Omega 3's for circulatory vessel health, and red yeast rice for cholesterol control, I am adding this Nattomax for anti-clotting and circulation enhancement.  Presently, my blood lab numbers are great and I've never felt better.  Starting NattoMax this week, I've had no observed side effects.  So, we'll see how this works out over a period of months.As far as the vendor here, I'm a long time Jarrow Formulas user, and have found their supplements to be of consistent high quality and supported by a good foundation of available information.I'll re-open this review with any important updates, most especially to report anything negative that emerges.
B0013OX9XW I'll be honest, I'd never heard of Natto before. I read about its reported benefits as a natural blood thinner and possibly preventative to Alzheimer's Disease (which runs in the family) and decided, what the hey, why not. Nearly 30 days later and I'm still alive without any negative reactions to the supplements. I couldn't say that I'm any better, but I gather that it is more of a preventativeThe only reported benefit I can mention, and this may be a coincidence, but I am usually a very cold-natured person and since I started NattoMax I feel less inclined to walk around with a blanket everywhere or two hoodies to keep warm. I'm still cold natured, mind you, but less so. Possibly this is due to the circulation benefits of Natto...or the fact that the weather is getting warmer.In any case, the capsules are small and easy to swallow. Take one a day with a meal. I haven't noticed any upset stomach or other negative signs and maybe a few benefits. If you think this will help you, I say go for it.
B0013OX9XW This product helped the person I asked to sample this item by preventing blood clots.  It seems a more delicate solution than other medications on the market.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, is doing a great job of improving my circulation. My hands and feet have always been so cold. They feel like I should be wearing gloves and socks all the time. Except in the hottest weather I can't go without sock on or even sleep without socks on. My hands and feet feel warmer now and if I touch someone, they aren't jumping when I touch them because my hands are so cold. That definitely says that what it's doing for
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements because the anti-oxidant power of pomegranates are said to have anti-aging benefits as well as aiding skin cell regeneration. These vitamins are easy to take, have no taste and are less expensive than the juice. I believe that my skin has benefitted from taking these in addition to DHA supplements and will continue to take them everyday.
B0013OXA5Y It's nice to be able to enjoy the (cardiovacular, cellular and anti-oxidant) benefits of Pomegranates without having to worry about cutting through the leathery fruit, geting red juice all over the place (I eat pomegranates over newspapers) chomping on those bitter white seeds, or paying a bundle for the pure juice.The Recommended serving size of  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is One capsule one or two times a day -- I take 2 or 3 at a time, just once -- I don't take this daily, and I don't believe there is an over-dosing problem with that extra amount, as I have in the past glugged a good share of those pure pomegranate juices, and enjoyed them (except for the astringent action in my stomach from too much of a good thing from those juices).My ONLY concern is the ingredient making up the  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard capsule -\"hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose\" - that is a Polymer, (also used in eyedrops) and not something natural. Aren't there capsules that are made from regular cellulose? Shouldn't that be used instead of the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose????I guess I can email those concerns of mine to Jarrow and see what they say.
B0013OXA5Y Antioxidants are considered to be pretty good for your body, and pomegranates are a good source of antioxidants.  However, pomegranates are also pretty expensive and difficult to eat, requiring a lot of effort to get the edible seeds out of the fruit.Jarrow has created this supplement from pomegranate extract.  You get the beneficial antioxidants from the pomegranate without the expense or effort required to prepare the fruit for eating.  (And, for those of you up on your Greek myth, no annual trips to visit Hades in the underworld as a result of eating pomegranate seeds!)If you're looking to add antioxidants to your diet, this is a good way to do it.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y I used to drink POMWonderful juice daily. Then I realized that PomWonderful, while claiming to have a lot of antioxidants, also has an exorbitant amount of sugar (something like 28 g in one serving).The benefits of pomegranate are desirable for antioxidants as well as cardiofunction, so these vitamins come in handy. I take them as a vitamin C supplement.;, i.e., instead of taking vitamin C.The pill itself is about medium size but easy to swallow. I prefer wrapping it in food and literally taking it \"with food\" for easier swallowing and digestion.The pills are great, but as with any vitamins, try to get as much of the real thing as you can, and only tak the vitamins when the real fruit is unavailable (not in season / you are on the road).These are vegan/vegetarian safe, if you are worried about allergens.
B0013OXA5Y I gave this five stars because I love jarrow Formulas and it is one of three top brands of supplements I usually buy. I am a supplement freak and easily take at least 15 different ones a day. I can't say that I know for sure any of them do anything except for Methyl B12 which I can feel, vitamin C, fiber, and D3. This one, with pomguard, Jarrow's proprietary brand of pomegranite, is one that I just have to use on faith.I am sure you know the hype about pomegranite so I won't rehash it here except to say that it had it's day a few years back as the antioxidant du jour. I, like many others, bought and drank POM, pomegranite juice, for a while until I realized that it didn't seem to do much except add calories to my diet.These little pills go down easily, and I like knowing that just in case they really do help prevent aging and illness, I am being protected by them. Whether you feel the need to add pomegranite antioxidants to your daily regimen is up to you, but if you do, you can't beat Jarrow Formulas as a trusted brand.
B0013OXA5Y I hear a lot about pomegranates' antioxidant properties, but I do not have enough of pomegranate in my diet.  I do not buy pomegranates often because they are only tasty during the season, but then they are quite expensive. The pomegranate juice is available but is expensive and causes me to have a heartburn.  These pills seem to be a good alternative.  They are a good value for the amount of antioxidants they provide and they do not cause heartburn.  That said, after taking this supplement for some time, I do not notice any difference in how I feel, so, hopefully, it is working.
B0013OXA5Y If you're looking for a healthy antioxidant, pomegranate's a great choice.  They're high in antioxidant value (measured in ORACs-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) and are VERY beneficial to the cardiovascular system.  I'm using PomGuard for reducing free radical damage; I had to have multiple medically necessary CAT scans & want to limit the long-range after-effects as much as possible, so I actively look for concentrated sources of antioxidants like this.Capsules are so much easier to take than pomegranate juice and have a lot less sugar; these are reasonably priced and personally, I trust Jarrow's quality control--it's one of my favorite go-to brands.I don't know if it's a placebo effect or not, but I take mine about 30 minutes before a treadmill workout and find that it's an energy-booster, giving me more stamina (I can easily walk longer at faster speeds).  I also like this because it's a \"whole food\" antioxidant.  I think in our modern environment, we're bombarded by so many oxidators (indoor and outdoor air pollution, for example) that it's absolutely essential to take a full range of antioxidants and fight back where we can. Nature knows best; I like these!
B0013OXA5Y I love that PomGuard only has real Pomegranates in it, and not any unnatural ingredients.  Since I can only find Pomegranates during a few months of the year, I can rarely benefit from this fruit and its antioxidants.  I love PomGuard because I don't have to worry about that, and I get fruit antioxidants every day of the year.
B0013OXA5Y Many times when I use a supplement I get heartburn or end up with a bad taste in my mouth later on.  These didn't do that.  I used the entire bottle in full, and I didn't notice any visible astonishing benefits, but those aren't necessarily visible anyway.  It's to help cardiovascular function and to be an antioxidant...I can only assume that it achieved that.On another note, there are no contraindications or side effects of note (checking Web MD) and these are organic and vegetarian.  Since pomengranite seems to promise so many health benefits, I'm planning on continuing to use these.  They are pure pomengranite and much easier to consume than with fresh fruit....
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates is by far one of the most important fruits you can eat.Here in South Florida, we're fortunate enough to have a fairly regular supply of Pomegranates in our supermarkets most of the year.  And, usually one Pomegranate is about $1.50 each.  And, I absolutely love the juice that sits on those seeds.One of my sisters is into health-related products and used to sell those Pomegranate juices for almost $10/ bottle for a 1-litre container.  She swears by its heart-healthy benefits.  I couldn't agree more.***Pomeguard is a dietary supplement and a good thing to have if you're not in an area where you can get fresh pomegranates to eat. The pills are small and easily digestible.No supplement can take the place of eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but this supplement is great to have.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrante juice is tart and not very appealing.  It is also expensive.Fresh pomegrantes are a mess to prepare.  I usually avail myself of frozen pomegrante seeds. Not all in my family enjoy their crunchiness as I do.This antioxidant formula may be just the boost to our own personal regimen.Time will tell but for now...good product!As always, everyone should research their own medical issues before taking anything that may interfere with meds or existing conditions.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have been used medicinally since ancient times.It's believed to have antioxidant effects.Pomegranate extract may help in heart failure, blood pressure, high cholesterol and for a very, very broad range of ailments.Topically, pomegranates has been noted to help inflammation of hemorrhoids and is also used to eliminate parasites.These Jarrow tablets contain 100% pomegranate extract from California and I believe they are very high quality.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes have become quite the rage.  Touted for their antioxidant benefits, the fruit and their juice have become prohibitively expensive. Moreover it is challenging to extract the seeds.This supplement contains 100% pomegrante extract making it easy and affordable to enjoy the advantages without the mess and expense. The pills are easy to swallow and I noticed no side effects.  As with most supplements of this type, they are prophylactic and their benefits are hard to guage.My experience with Jarrow has been positive. Their supplments are high quality and their customer service people are responsive. If you are looking to incorporate the goodness of pomegrante into your diet, this is an easy way to do so.
B0013OXA5Y I like shifting around the sources for antioxidants in my diet. I never mind buying blackberries, raspberries, or strawberries when they are on sale...but beyond those most of the fruit sources of antioxidants get pretty pricey. This is why I like the Jarrow PomGuard product. I never take these regularly but do take them on days or during a week where I'm not have berries or a fruit juice. Despite their price tag, these are still a better buy than Pomegranate juice and provide the same benefits.With several Jarrow supplements, I have experienced what another reviewer referenced in terms of taste. I don't mind a quick bitter taste, but if you let these linger on your tongue too long before swallowing, you might need more than one glass of water to wash them down.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate, good.  Expensive, not good.  Extracts in pill form for POTENTIAL health benefits, cheaper...good.  Pomegranate has been consumed by many nations for thousands of years, by both men and women with no ill effects.  As a supplement, just be aware of the fact that it may raise salivary testosterone.Suggested UsageTake 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day after meals or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.NOTE: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.Other IngredientsSilcon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.
B0013OXA5Y A normal sized clear capsule, Pomguard is easy to swallow, doesn't smell strange, leaves no after taste and has none of the awful and sometimes dangerous side effects of pharmaceuticals.I decided to try this supplement when my last check-up showed that my cholesterol was beginning to head in the wrong direction and I didn't want to take prescription medications to lower cholesterol because of the awful side effects other family members have suffered from taking Statins.As with any supplement, until I see my Physician for blood tests, I will not be able to tell if this has had any positive effects but I will keep taking it in the hopes that it will help lower my cholesterol and with all the anti-oxidants Pomegranate is known to contain it certainly can't hurt to try.
B0013OXA5Y Deciding on a supplement involves around two major decisions. First what supplement do I want, how much of the active ingredient, supporting ingredients, fillers, etc. So what is in it.But the second one that we don't always think about is who is the company? Do you trust them? Will they put in what they see they do at the level they claim and will they keep out what they say they are keeping out? This is my second Jarrow product and I believe from my experiences and other reviews that they are a company to trust. I mostly take Andrew Lessman vitamins for the same reason. They cost more but I believe they have in them what they claim to.As for this itself. If you are considering it you have some interest in pomegranates. I seems to be a very good antioxidant. I am taking this with my Lessmans. On days I take them I feel energetic the whole day through, focused, and in a good mood. I can't separate this one out.But I can say this is a good company and that is very important when considering a supplement. And Jarrow should be on your list to consider.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard by Jarrow Formulas is a decent supplement.  It consists of capsules containing pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid.  Other IngredientsThe only other ingredient is silcon dioxide. The capsule is made from hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.As with other Jarrow Formula products, PomGuard contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts.Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract and there are  60 capsules in the bottle.Pomegranate is an antioxidant, and is believed to support cardiovascular and arterial functions.  Of course, as an antioxidant, it can reduce free radical damage.Jarrow Formulas' recommended dose is 1 to 2 capsules per day.  The extract contains the whole fruit, that is peel, membrane, juice and seed.NOTE: Although the active ingredient in the capsules is pomegranate fruit extract, please keep in mind this looks and smells like pretty much any other gelatin capsule product.  If you are expecting something chewable, sweet, etc. this IS NOT it.The capsules are average size and not difficult to swallow.This is a good supplement if you like to take antioxidants and/or are a believer in some of the benefits attributed to pomegranate.
B0013OXA5Y I've taken various antioxidant type supplements over the past year or so and I switch between brands once in awhile to see which is more effective. As far as the Jarrow brand I've been using their supplements for a couple of years now.I like to work-out a lot and to prevent free-radical damage I take some type of anti-oxidant supplement right after my workouts. I've been taking this for a couple of weeks now and have not experienced any side-effects. Good supplement with high-quality ingredients.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a believer that we're best off eating a wide variety of foods when possible so that we get a variety of different helpful vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and all of that. Usually eating actual food is better, but pomegranate has a good reputation for being an exceptionally healthy choice and isn't necessarily available in fresh form all year long (around here I only see it a month or so a year) so I can see how supplementing with an extract could make sense.Unless you're trying to help a really specific condition, though, this is the kind of supplement I'd tend to mix in every few days rather than as an every day thing. Since I tend to think it's probably best to get a variety of antioxidants, I wouldn't want to fall into the habit of relying on the same pill every day to supply them. I can definitely see where there could be a fair bit of value, though, in using it as an extra source of them a few times a week.The pills are a pretty standard supplement size and just little clear capsules holding red powder. No awful smells or anything that makes them unusually hard to take. If you really wanted, I suppose there's no reason you couldn't pop the capsule open to mix the powder into something for someone who can't/won't swallow pills well.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are supposed to be very good for you.  Supposedly it is also a symbol of fertility and powerful thing to put in your body.That being said, pomegranates are very expensive to buy at the  supermarket and are messy to eat.  The liquid forms may be loaded with sugar if not the pure juice version.So this is a great way to get the nutrients in a easy to ingest format.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are marketed as a superfruit. Other superfruits like acai and dragonfruit are all the rage now and pomegranate seems to have taken a backseat. They are high in healthful compounds like polyphenols, which is also found in tea and coffee.One capsule supplies 425mg. Take 1 or 2 capsules a day after meals.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice is awfully expensive nowadays, and this supplement contains derivatives of pomegranate that are just as beneficial as the juice.  Pomegranate supports a healthy cholesterol level, acts as a powerful antioxidant in our bodies, maintains a healthy blood platelet level, helps with high blood pressure, stimulates collagen synthesis (great for skin!), and more.  Jarrow has done it again.  I have lots of their formulations and consider Jarrow to be my favorite brand for supplements.  Always high quality.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is definitely good for you and especially if you get the fresh product either in full fruit form or juice. I've been drinking the juice on a regular basis and it's a great, healthy replacement for sugary drinks and makes me feel like I'm living a healthy life. I've become a pomegranate addict!!! This is a good substitute and simply contains an extract of pomegranate. I have to say though, I really don't notice a big difference in how my body feels when I take this, I just know it's good for me :-)
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are renowned for their anti-oxidant abilities but who enjoys eating a pomegranate?  They are tart and filled with seeds and are more trouble than they are worth.  Pomegranate juice is very expensive.  These tablets therefore are easy to swallow, lack that tart aftertaste, and still provide the benefits of the pomegranate.I take one in the morning after my coffee.  While I can not profess a long life or newborn physical abilities, I know I am taking in the benefits of the pomegranate daily.
B0013OXA5Y I have enjoyed pomegranates since the 1980's (back when they were called \"Chinese apples\"). I can usually get a decent deal on them where I live, but they can be very messy and time consuming to prep. I don't like the commercial juice, as it is way too sweet for me. These supplements are a pretty decent way to get the antioxidants and other health benefits from pomegranates. I would not suggest these over eating the actual fruit though unless pomegranates are hard to find or expensive in your area. Check with your health care provider before taking these to make sure they do not interfere with any medications you are taking. The pills are fairly small and not hard to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I have not tried any of Jarrow's brand of multivitamins. However when I saw the pomguard tablets and read what benefits the vitamins provided I had to check them out. I really like the idea that they are all natural. I am particular about what I put in my body especially when it comes to vitamins.The tablets are easy to swallow but they do get some getting used to. What I mean is that there is some bitter taste to them. This might be because the tablets are more compact and concentrated whereas when you buy the pom juice it still has a little bitter taste but it is not as concentrated. Overall, I would say this is a good product for your money.
B0013OXA5Y These are fairly large capsules filled with 100% powdered pomegranate extract. The powder is a purple-brown and has a pleasant scent and no discernible flavor when swallowing. I am taking one of these daily along with Jarrow Formulas Quercetin. I hope both together make a potent antioxidant combination.
B0013OXA5Y I would like to buy a lot more pomegranate juice but since it's such a popular juice, it's so expensive and the jars are small! I like this supplement because it's a cheaper alternative to buying bottles and bottles of pomegranate juice and you get the antioxident powers of pomegranites in an easy to swallow supplement.Pomguard supplements a re easy to take and the pills are not too large. I've not had any indigestion or heartburn from this supplement. Pomegranites have been used in healthy diets for a long time, but eating pomegranites can be time consuming and they can be messy and even stain clothes. For many of the benefits of eating pomegranites, I now take Pomguard in a easy to swallow supplement. I make sure and take any supplements with food and not on an empty stomach because they tend to upset my stomach without food. Food also helps to deliver the nutrients throughout your body. Pom juice and fruit juices contain high quanities of sugar and that's anothe plus of taking a supplement such as Pomguard. Jarrow makes high quality, innovative supplements.
B0013OXA5Y The phenolic extracts included from pomegranates have free radical scavenging properties. This helps prevent more diseases and bad conditions than I can cite. Currently there are about a dozen separate trials registered with the National Institute of Health to determine whether the expectations of pomegranates can be validated.I believe this product deserves 5 stars because it's not just extracts from the juice. In fact, the micronutrients in pomegranate seeds, which is included in these tablets, are tremendous and have antibacterial properties.
B0013OXA5Y For those of us who see improved health with supplements, having to take three or six capsules a day, particularly in divided doses, is a real pain.  Thus I am delighted to be able to get what should be a therapeutic dosage in a single daily capsule.  Kudos to Jarrow.I am taking this supplement to lower bad cholesterol.  My doctor wants to put me on cholesterol-lowering medicine and I am resisting.  So I started taking this supplement two weeks ago with no side effects. I don't like the flavor of pomegranate juice so this is a better way for me to get it into my system.My annual physical is several months away and I will continue the supplement until then.  In the absence of a blood test, I have no way of knowing if it is useful.
B0013OXA5Y My mother says Pomegranate is good for your heart.  So...as far as I can tell it's helping me.  I guess it's better than eating beans.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because i heard great things about it. And i was getting tired of my acai juices. So this is nice to get teh benefits with an easy to swallow pill.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard is a pomegranate extract and the health benefits of pomegranates are wonderful. The PomGuard pill itself is a medium sized extract filled capsule. It's ok to take. I have a little trouble with the capsules going down as smooth as a regular tablet but it's not that bothersome.I didn't have any side effects or upset stomach with it.
B0013OXA5Y It's fairly accepted that pomegranate is a great anti-oxidant and this is a very convenient way to get that into your diet.  The active ingredient is 425mg of pomegranate fruit extract, with the only other ingredient being silicon dioxide.  It states that the pomegranates are from California.  It doesn't state the amount or percentage of ellagic acid, but it does state that there is no synthetic ellagic acid.  These are in capsule form and have a pleasant smell and a reddish brown color (I've used another brand that had an objectionable smell and taste).  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y My husband uses this and we trust the Jarrow name. I don't like to buy brands i have never heard of just because they are cheaper.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow FormulasPomguard 425mg, 60 TabletsI've always been a big pomegranate fan - they're one of those foods like salads or kale that just make me feel good when I eat them. In recent years many health claims have been made about the health benefits of pomegranates and their antioxidant chemicals, how they contribute to cardiovascular health and help regulate blood pressure. I don't doubt it, although I do wonder is products like this isolate the beneficial phytonutrients from specific plants can ever really replace the benefits of eating the plants themselves, but PomGuard pitches itself as a more holistic product, including all the phytonutrients (or many of them) found in the pomegranate fruit, not just a few separate chemicals thought to have health benefits.My experience with PomGuard is limited, but seems good - I've taken it for about two weeks and felt a notable uptick in what I think of as a citric/fruit feeling, the sort of healthy, energetic burst you feel after eating a grapefruit or lemon.  It wasn't as strong a feeling as if I'd eaten some real, live pomegranate, but it was good enough, and definitely better than when I drink pomegranate juice, which has always seemed a little too sugar-heavy. (I'm not big on juices in general now, after finding out about their astronomical glycemic index and how bad they are for blood sugar levels -- much better to eat the whole fruit or, in this case, a supplement version.)  This product is certainly worth trying, particularly if you have dietary restrictions such as diabetes, but still would like to receive some of the health benefits of this potent fruit.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are already well established for their healthy benefits: A powerful antioxidant, heart health, nourishes skin, and is supposed to be a great inhibitor of women troubles (PMS, menopause issues, ITUs, etc.)Jarrow formulas is a very affordable and easily absorbed product as Pom-products can be rather pricey, Jarrow gets my vote for reliable products that are easily digestible and affordable.
B0013OXA5Y Well packaged, fresh, and intact pills. Good way to sup without getting the sugar found in the juice, which is also expensive. The real fruit is not bad, but is messy. So having something in extract form is nice and Jarrow is a company I trust. No side effects for this product for me. 425mg of extract per pill.
B0013OXA5Y I have been switching back and forth between blueberry and black raspberry antioxidant supplements.  It was nice to switch things up by trying PomGuard.Jarrow is one of my favorite supplement manufacturers.  I trust the products and search for their brands first when looking for a specific supplement.I not experienced any bad side effects to these supplements.  No stomach upset and that is my biggest issue.  I finished the bottle and all was well.Current price point is excellent.  If you are in the market for an anti-oxidant or a supplement for cardiovascular health, I would give Jarrow's PomGuard a try.
B0013OXA5Y Grown in California, USA - WINNER!I take it for my 67 year old cartilage and for LDL cholesterol (see below).LOVE that is is PURE extract and nothing else but capsules.Keeper!Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins.  LDL, is known as \"bad\" cholesterol. HDL, is known as \"good\" cholesterol.When too much LDL (bad) cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. It can form plaque (thick, hard deposit) that narrows the arteries making them less flexible; heart attack or stroke can result.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow makes some excellent products, and is thoughtful in creating products like this that provide all the benefits of pure ingredients, and suitable for vegetarians and those with specific allergies. According to the label it contains no wheat, no gluten, so soybeans, no egg, no dairy, no fish/shellfish and no peanuts/tree nuts. It costs a bit more than some bargain brands, but you don't have to worry about additives or ingredients (like gelatin capsules) made from animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I really like Jarrow Formula's products, and PomGuard is one of the good ones. Pomegranate has many health benefits, many of the same benefits you get from the ever-popular Acai. It is full of antioxidants, which helps eliminate free radicals from the body. It is also supposed to support cardiovascular function, which I really need right now. The capsules aren't hard to swallow, and you only have to take one once or twice a day. It never hurts to start taking something that's good for your health!
B0013OXA5Y I am a believer in the benefits of the pomegranate, but really do not have the budget to be constantly buying fruits.  I found this to be a great little supplement that gives a fair substitute (though of course not perfect) of eating the fruit--I feel about as good as I do when I am actually eating it.  The pills are quite small and easy to take.  All in all, a great way to get a nutrition boost.
B0013OXA5Y Love this great Jarrow supplement that provides antioxidents and heart healthy formula. Everyone loves the great healing properties of Pomegranate, but some may not like the taste of the juice. While some of the juices are not all pomegranate and the cost can be prohibitive too. Here is a reasonably priced solution. Pomegranate in an easy to swallow capsule.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not entirely sure how to review this product, since I'm not authorized to conduct double-blind clinical trials on human subjects to look for measurable health benefits. It has no particular taste, which is too bad, because pomegranates are delicious as well as lovely. But, since the real thing is expensive and not always in season, I suppose at least I'm getting the antioxidants from the capsules. The capsules are vegan, which is a plus if you don't consume animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I feel much better after taking this supplement. I have not check anything, so I don't know whether something is better than before, but my feeling has been improved.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow's PomGuard is a product made solely from different parts of the pomegranate, a fruit universally championed for centuries as a healing aid. Many cultures through time have used it as a kind of all-purpose medicine cabinet, from the Greeks and Romans to any number of aboriginal cultures. It's been shown that some of those old guys knew a thing or two that conventional collegiate training didn't deduce. This is apparently the case with pomegranates and anything derived from them. PomGuard incorporates all areas of the fruit, which promotes antioxidation, healthy cholesterol, healthy platelet production, good blood pressure, and something which initially alarmed me called 'apoptosis' (programmed death) - which turns out to be the proper programming of cell death in preparation for new cell production and growth.
B0013OXA5Y I've been reading about the benefits of antioxidants a lot lately. Pretty much every book about health talks about how antioxidants counteract the free radicals floating around your system that can cause cancer. These free radicals are in foods that most Americans eat far too much of, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, packaged foods, and fried foods.There's no denying that pomegranates are trendy right now. But are they the best antioxidant available? It's written on the bottle that pomegranates contain a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins, and ellagitannins. I did a quick internet search for \"types of polyphenols\" to find out more about the polyphenols found in pomegranates.Ellagic acid has been shown from preliminary laboratory evidence to have anticancer properties, but there is not yet any clear evidence from clinical studies showing that for sure. It may also protect your cardiovascular system from plaque formation and stiffening of the arteries.Anthocyanins are said to be part of the reason that red wine drinkers in France and Italy have lower rates of coronary heart disease. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties.Unfortunately, I found some conflicting information about polyphenols when researching \"risks of polyphenols\". For one, certain polyphenols may have carcinogenic effects or may interfere with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. This is particularly true in the case of soy isoflavones, but may also be true for other polyphenols. In addition, the consumption of polyphenols may inhibit iron absorption. Lastly, polyphenols may interact with certain pharmaceutical drugs and enhance their effects. That would give me pause if I was taking any type of prescription drug. While none of this has been proven in clinical studies, there's enough of a concern that I would only personally take a polyphenol supplement for a specific reason, not necessarily as an everyday thing just for long-term preventative benefits.These pills from Jarrow brand are in a standard capsule shape with powder inside. When you open them up, they have a very bitter flavor such as that of concentrated cranberries. There is no discernible odor, and they are as easy to swallow as any other standard gelcap.
B0013OXA5Y My health care provider is NUTS about pomegranates and wants me to have half of one every day, but what a hassle! Pomegranate juice is so much easier, and has all the benefits, (except fiber) but WOW it's expensive - even more than the fruit! So here's the answer - PomGuard - a simple, easy to take, high potency PILL! What could be better? Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes are all the rage in health news right now. They have lots of healthy antioxidants and are great for heart health and other things. I love pomegranates and wish I could eat enough of them to get the fantastic benefits.Unfortunately for me, where I live poms are very expensive. If you can find them, they are less than fresh and appealing. I have tried adding pomegranate juice but that is also expensive. So I was glad to try Jarrow's PomGaurd. It smells a little unappealing. But the pills are easy to take. I did not experience any stomach upset. This is a great less expensive way to get the benefits without trying to eat a four dollar dessicated pomegranate every day.
B0013OXA5Y The Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets is a great supplement to get your daily intakes of pomegranates even when it is not available or in season in your particular location. Pomegranates, as everyone who is into fruits, is considered as one of the \"superfruits\" because of the varied and tremendous amounts of nutrients that can be derived from eating this fruit. It contains compounds which supports cardio health by lowering cholesterol, maintaining an ideal blood pressure and helps prevents or minimize arterial blockages in the heart. It also contains a good amount of antioxidants which inhibits the development of some cancers. Since this is a tropical fruit, it is mostly available here in the midwest during the summer where I take advantage of eating a lot of this fruit while it is seasonally available. With the Pomguard, a tablet a day, assures you of getting the full nutrional benefits of Pomegranates all year round. Very happy with this supplement and will be making this a part of my daily supplemental intake. Highly recommended!
B0013OXA5Y Here is a easy way to get the benefits of pomegranates, which for me are only available at certain times of the year, and I find the juice drinks to expensive.This is a capsule type with dry fill, even though website lists as a tablet. Taken once a day, I have no problems taking this one, no upset. Happy with product. 60 day supply.
B0013OXA5Y This dietary suppliment from Jarrow is a nice source of antioxidents.Each bottle contains 60 capsules.Contains 100% California Pomegranate fruit extract.
B0013OXA5Y With a family medical history that includes Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, I've been taking antioxidants for several years, including pomegranate extracts, juices, and teas. I've taken other Jarrow products, so I had no problem with changing to Jarrow Pomgard capsules. Most of the other pomegranate supplements that I've tried weren't always clear on what parts of the fruit were used, but Jarrow's formula includes the whole fruit extract - juice, peel, seed, and membrane. That's the only way to know that you're getting all the benefits of the pomegranate.I've done a lot of personal research into the alleged benefits of taking pomegranate supplements, and it's an impressive list. If only a few of the claimed benefits are realized, then it's well worth taking.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate has so many health benefits but unfortunately I really don't like the taste of the juice. Also, a lot of fruit juices have a lot of sugar which I try to avoid. Therefore a capsule such as this one--100% pomegranate extract and nothing else--is a great thing for me. Both my husband and I take this capsule for it's antioxidant properties and to help improve cardiovascular function.This capsule isn't too big in size and doesn't have a funny taste when you swallow it. You only have to take one or two a day which isn't bad at all. I also try to take a flaxseed capsule for cardiovascular health but that capsule is so much bigger in size and is actually rather difficult to swallow. I'm not great at taking pills so i'm glad that this PomGuard capsule isn't overly large.I'm very happy with this product.
B0013OXA5Y The label indicates Pomegranates are loaded with anti-oxidants for cardiovascular health, however, one of my mentors who was raised in the Asian culture shared the wisdom of consuming pomegranates for urinary tract health. Previously I was often dealing with UTIs but since I began consuming more pomegranates and pomegranate based supplements, I've rarely experienced UTIs and now they are much easier to deal eliminate them when one begins, they no longer gain a strong foothold as before. I am impressed with the quality found in all the various Jarrow Formula supplements I have sampled. The bottle I received from Amazon had approximately 18 months remaining.Per the label:Serving Size 1 Capsule  Servings per Container  60Pomegranate Extract  425 mgOther ingredients: silicon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxyproylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.Usage: Take 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day, after meals, or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.  Note: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.  ... derived from 100 % California Pomegranates, contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.  ... NO synthetic ellagic acid.
B0013OXA5Y I usually pick up some pomegranate juice once in a while for its health benefits (and i like the taste), but it is so expensive.  These tablets contain 425mg of pomegranate extract and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a definite believer in adding antioxidants to your diet. I also like facial products with antioxidants. I drink teas with antioxidants. I try to eat a \"rainbow\" of foods, and include various forms of nutritional antioxidants daily.I know I don't eat enough fruit, and I don't have the patience to eat actual pomegranites. So this is kind of a treat for my body.On the days I know I'm going to eat poorly - as on holidays, when traveling, or if I'm just super busy - then I make sure to grab antioxidant supplements.Pomegranite is one of the top \"faddish\" antioxidants, but some research shows it's a good one, up there with blueberries, acai, red wine, green tea, and vitamins A and C.The bottle recommends taking these after - not during - a meal.The pills come in a clear cellulose form of capsule, containing a reddish chunky powder. The bottle smells vaguely of fruit when you sniff the inside.The pills are 3/4s of an inch and are easy to swallow.There are sixty pills in a bottle and the serving size is one pill. As a two- month supply, this is a pretty good deal. I can stretch this out a bit by changing around which antioxidant pills I take that day. I try to mix it up with other antioxidants supplements, and if I have a big fruit day, I leave it at that.Recommended as part of an array of antioxidant sources. Nice quality pills.
B0013OXA5Y When I operated natural food stores and pomegranates were in season, I'd drink the juice of one every day by squeezing it all around, pricking it with my produce knife (used to butt heads of lettuce, etc.), and sucking the juice out. More recently when I learned about the antioxidant properties of pomegranates, I tried some juices that contained pomegranate juice, but I was never that impressed with the flavor nor with the amount of pomegranate said on labels to be actually in each serving. Jarrow Pomguard allows one to get the benefits of pomegranate by simply taking a daily capsule.WebMD has an informative article on the uses, side effects and interactions of pomegranate. Those considering taking a pomegranate supplement such as Jarrow PomGuard who also take prescription medications may want to check out the section on interactions at WebMD (e.g., pomegranate can lower blood pressure so someone taking any kind of medication that can also decrease blood pressure should be aware of this, plus one should know that pomegranate can \"decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications\").Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OXA5Y I take several supplements recommended by doctor and nutritionist, and although Pomguard is not one on their list, from what I have read and researched, it is good for the body in many ways.  I don't drink pomegranate juice because the sugar content is too high, so I am putting my confidence in these tablets.  .  I have tried several Jarrow products from the amazon Vine Program and they appear to be a reputable company with few additions to their products.
B0013OXA5Y This amazon page says the capsule contains gelatin, but my bottle says the capsules are vegetarian and made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. I don't know if they could have changed the capsule, but the image of the bottle also says vegetarian, so I'm going to assume it is.I'd love to eat a pomegranate every day. Love 'em. Or drink a bunch of pomegranate juice. Love that, too. Pretty expensive and not always in season, though. The best is when this place at the farmer's market has frozen some juice from their fall crop and has it when the market opens in the spring! But I digress...These capsules seem like a good way to get the healthy benefits of pomegranates without trying to find a pomegranate every day. I stuck my nose in the bottle and it smelled faintly of pomegranate. I opened a capsule and tasted the red powder inside. It was very bitter. Probably not surprising since this is supposed to be extracted from the whole fruit, peel, seed, everything, plus the capsules also contain silicon dioxide.The label says it contains 425mg of pomegranate extract. I wish I knew what that meant or how the different parts of the pomegranate compare in terms of antioxident levels (so is it good or bad that they use the entire fruit, even the peel?) I wish I knew how much fresh or frozen pomegranate I'd have to eat to equal the same amount. These do seem like a convenient way to get some antioxidents, and if you are intent on getting some ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins, then it's worth a shot.
B0013OXA5Y There are a variety of ways to get the benefits of pomegranate into your diet. Of course, drinking the juice or eating them is a great way to do that (but some commercial juices have very little actual pomegranate, so read the label.) This supplement is made of pure pomegranate extract and is not synthetic. It contains a mixture of ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.Ellagic acid is also found in blueberries and cranberries. It's not only an antioxidant (prevents damage of cells by free radicals, which are small, highly reactive molecules) but it is believed to be \"anti-proliferative\" or an inhibitor of cancer. Lots of fruits, nuts and vegetables contain these substances (dark red fruits have anthocyanins and ellagic acid is in many nuts and berries.) So if you feel you do not get enough of these into your diet, you can supplement with this extract of pomegranate juice.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is one of the recent superfoods, being extolled for its polyphenol content and the anti-oxidant and radical fighting properties thereof.What I like about Jarrow's PomGuard is that the extract is from the whole fruit (skin, seed and juice) instead of just the juice. The phytonutrients are more bioavailable when the whole fruit is consumed. Also, the pomegranate extract is 100% from California pomegranates without any synthetic ingredients.An interesting ingredient I found in this product as well as some other Jarrow capsules is silicon dioxide, aka sand. It's used to prevent powders from clumping together. At first I thought it was pretty gross to ingest sand but on further research I also found that silicon is a necessary trace element for bone development and lots of natural foods contain silicone dioxide, and it decreases the risk of dementia.Back to pomegranate capsules, PomGuard is the one I like best. I've looked at a variety of them on the internet and Jarrow's product comes with the most detailed provenance, it tells you exactly what it contains and where its from, so this is the one I would recommend most.
B0013OXA5Y Lots of people fail to eat enough fruit.  I am one of those people.  So I am always looking for ways to (easily, if possible) add fruit to my diet.  This is one great way to add some of the benefits of eating more fruit.
B0013OXA5Y For about a year, I subscribed to a monthly delivery of POMx pills, made by POM Wonderful.  Since pomegranates contain polyphenols and help neutralize free radicals, the choice to consume 1g daily was really an easy decision.  Over the course of using POMx for a year, I didn't really notice any readily apparent changes although there were probably internal and less visible benefits to my cardiovascular system and function as well as a reduction in oxidative damage.Being no stranger to Jarrow Formulas supplements, I was pleasantly surprised to see them offering PomGuard, their own pomegranate pill based on 100% California Pomegranates.  One of the obvious differences between PomGuard and POMx is the potency of the pills - PomGuard pills supply 400mg of pomegranate powder consisting of a range of polyphenolic compounds.  POMx pills provide 1000mg per capsule of their proprietary blend.  POMx is an extract of the polyphenol compounds from the whole fruit.  Likewise, PomGuard is the juice, peel, seed and membrane components of the pomegranate.  I guess as long as they both end up supplying polyphenols, the benefit is the same, though POMx seems to win the potency battle.  Do you need the equivalent of 8 oz. of pomegranate juice per day?  It ends up being your personal decision.One attraction to PomGuard is the price point which is approximately 60% less cost than POMx.  I think as a maintenance dose, PomGuard would be my choice for daily consumption.  I have noticed no ill effects from PomGuard.  Reaping the same benefits at a lower cost seems like a win-win for me.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice made from the fruit and rind has a higher level of antioxidants than juice made without the rind.  Since PomGuard includes the rind, hopefully this increases it's antioxidant levels as well.  According to Jarrow, \"PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule.\", so if you want the benefit of all the parts of the pomegranate in a pill, this appears to be the only option.  Jarrow also says that PomGuard has \"NO synthetic ellagic acid.\"Although I prefer to eat the fruit, by taking a PomGuard pill most days, I can eat other fruits as well, without overdoing the sugar that fruits contain (I'm a low-carb person). Since I don't eat the peel when I eat the fruit, PomGuard offers an advantage here too.
B0013OXA5Y My husband is the type of person to always worry about his heart so he eats a lot of things that promote heart health, including pomegranates. But they're very expensive so instead he started taking PomGuard and he's impressed. He says they don't have a funny aftertaste and they're just like eating a pomegranate every day for your heart.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are so full of vitamins and so healthy for you - but dang, they're expensive to buy and hard to eat!  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard has all the benefits of eating pomegranates all packed into one little pill.  The pill is not large, easy to swallow, and delivers quite a healthy punch of vitamins and antioxidants.  While I can't give numbers on how effective they are in my system, I can say that I eat them and feel great.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y As I have stated in other product reviews on items from this company, I normally always like their products. This is another one that I submit is worth looking at. I am taking this product to help introduce more antioxidants, and pomegranate extract is a good source of these. This product is in a convenient form for me to do this, because this fruit is very seasonal in my area.
B0013OXA5Y It has been proven to have cardiovascular protective effects. It is good to drink the pure pomegranate juice but that gets quite expensive. These are easy to swallow capsules that have not caused me any side effects. Like all supplements you should check with your health care provider before adding anything new. You can take 1 to 2 a day after meals. I take one as I take quite a few Jarrow supplements as I trust the quality.
B0013OXA5Y I have been buying the Pomegranate juice at my local grocery for about six months ago. It costs me around $10 a week for a small shot a day.. These have more nutrients in them than the juice, Pomegranate is a supplement that has a lot of power health benefits including hearth and blood health. I have replaced juice with these, and am saving a lot of money! I take two a day between meals. No side effects at all!
B0013OXA5Y I've always heard about pomegranates being good for you due to their red color and antioxidant properties.  However, I've never bought them and really don't like the idea of dealing with all the seeds.  This supplement gives you all the health benefits of poms in a little pill.  Perfect.  I trust Jarrow for many of my vitamins and supplements, so the brand was a go for me.  I've been taking it daily, and, whereas I know I can't tell a difference, I feel like I've got some daily insurance that I'm doing something for my health and trying to offset free radical damage.  Of course, a pill like this won't give you the fiber and moisture that you get from fruits and veggies, so I eat lots of them daily.  But I will continue taking this insurance on a daily basis.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Pomguard is one of the many supplements that support cardiovascular health that I have.  I will try to always take supplements for that, and many, because I've had high cholesterol.  I refuse to take statins because of muscle and other damage.  Out of the 2+ shoe boxes of supplements I take daily, many of them support bone and cardiovascular health.  Jarrow makes many of them.Jarrow is mid-priced, but quality!More from Amazon:Jarrow FORMULAS PomGuard ; derived from 100% California Pomegranates; contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid; anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Contains only pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid. PomGuard : Supports cardiovascular functionReduces oxidative damage by free radicalsSupports healthy cell replication and functionKeep out of the reach of children.Patented Production Technology Yields the Ultimate Pomegranate SupplementPomGuard(tm) from Jarrow Formulas represents a new standard in antioxidant supplements. PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule. Clinical studies have linked pomegranates to cardiovascular health and uncovered several groundbreaking discoveries about the fruit's synergistic properties. This research led to PomGuard, a product which offers the complete spectrum of beneficial pomegranate phytonutrients.*Historical Uses of the PomegranateThe use of pomegranates for healing dates back to Biblical times. Healers in many aboriginal cultures still employ the bark, leaves, peel, juice and seeds to treat many health conditions. This knowledge was brought back to Europe in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians of London feature the pomegranate in their coats of arms. However, this fruit has been overlooked by modern Western medicine until very recently.Antioxidant ActivityPomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity. Indeed, in Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) testing, a standard for antioxidant capacity, fresh pomegranate fruit and juice preparations also surpassed the antioxidant activities of cranberry, blueberry and grape juices, all of which have been touted for their free radical scavenging properties. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane plus seed also contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. Lignins complement phenolic antioxidants (e.g., ellagic and gallic acids), by scavenging oxygen and nitric oxide free radicals.There is a great diversity to antioxidant action, with hundreds of different compounds acting on different types of free radicals. Nature's answer is to maintain broad-spectrum protection. Thus, in plants, phenolic antioxidants typically are associated with lignins.The superiority of antioxidant mixtures to single antioxidants is well known. In a series of studies, the antioxidant power of pure antioxidants was compared to (a) the antioxidant or cardioprotective action of complex tannins like punicalagin, (b) mixtures of punicalagin and other pomegranate tannins, and (c) whole pomegranate juice. Though punicalagin was more potent than the other single compound, the tannin mixtures were more potent than any single compound, and the whole pomegranate juice was more potent than the tannin mixture.Studies and BenefitsPomegranate juice and other fractions are known to provide numerous benefits:* Supports healthy low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) oxidation status** Enhances glutathione action, the primary antioxidant and heavy metal protector inside cells** Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity** Promotes healthy levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme involved in blood pressure regulation** Supports normal cell function and replication** Induces apoptosis (programmed death)** Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life*Clinical trials with pomegranate juice at several institutions have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.*
B0013OXA5Y I enjoy pomegranate juice, but it's expensive. I'm a big fan of most Jarrow products, and I'm glad they have this product because I can get a large dose of pomegranate in my diet.This is excellent if you're looking for anti-aging products. It's also good for coronary health.
B0013OXA5Y Of course I would prefer to consume the actual food rather than taking a supplement of any sort.  Real food is better when its possible, but there are certain foods that although beneficial, can be difficult to enjoy on a regular basis.I love pomegranates but only seem to have them occasionally at a salad bar or perhaps a glass of juice.  I once tried to buy and de-seed one and only succeeded in making quite a mess.  They are very good for you because they are high in antioxidants and are full of vitamin C and potassium.This supplement is easy to swallow, but it is a bit larger than an average capsule.  I have tried many products by Jarrow and have been pleased with their quality.I have been taking one per day so this bottle is a two month supply for me.  The directions indicate taking 1-2 daily.  This supplement combined with a healthy diet, exercise and my usual vitamin/mineral regime works fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y Most people know about Jarrow and how apparently good they are.  This prouct really seems to do a lot of things.Included is:Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity.  This is so important.  I have never known a vitamin or herb to do this and when my Pop was in the hospital with critically low levels of platelets this might have helped him.Supports normal cell function and replication.  In my opinion this is important to prevent cancer, because cancer is  cell replication that has gone haywire.Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life.  This is great for older joints and also athletes.It is have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.  Well the jury is out but if you can take one pill a day to help in all those areas, I'm in!
B0013OXA5Y These tablets are reasonable size and go down easy. Loaded with the concentrate of the most healthy fruit on the planet. Pom is great tasting fruit but is not avaialble all year round, hence I low PomGuard as I have it available all year round for good health and prevention.
B0013OXA5Y I really love to eat pomegranates, but can't always find them in the store, or deal with the mess.  I prefer the real deal over supplements any day, but these are nice to have when eating a live pomegranate is not an option.  I know pomegranates contain a high amount of anti-oxidants and other valuable compounds, and I try to eat at least one every other day.  When I can't I take one or two of these supplements.They are easy to swallow and hopefully work almost as well as a real pomegranate.  Don't forget all the fiber you get when you eat a pomegranate so don't just take these supplements to the total exclusion of eating the real things.
B0013OXA5Y I've happily found that Jarrow supplements tend to both work well and be well tolerated by my body.  I do feel a mild boost in immunity when taking pomegranate.  (Although, I'd rather just skip these pills and eat the yummy fruit or drink the yummy juice.)These are NOT marketed or intended as contraceptives (and I am in no way qualified to recommend them as such!), however it is said that in ancient times pomegranate seeds were used as contraceptives and abortofacients.  Two very good reasons to avoid these during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, please take extra care in speaking with your doctor about any supplements you are considering.As always when reviewing a supplement, I wish to state that I am not a medical professional and remind you to seek input (and approval) from your medical provider before taking this or any supplement.
B0013OXA5Y For years I've been reading about all the benefits of pomegranates, and I love the taste of both raw pomegranate and pom juice.However, I don't eat/drink pomegranate because of a low glycemic diet...and not to mention the expense. The supplements are a great way to get all the benefits without having to eat the actual fruit.As you may know, the more antioxidants in your diet the better. Antioxidants help ward off free radicals, which cause many diseases including most cancers, cause skin problems & premature aging, etc etc. And, pomegranates are about the most potent form of antioxidants on the planet.And I just learned recently that pomegranates also enhance glutathione action, which is how your body flushes a wide variety of toxins including heavy metals from your system (mercury from fish, lead from the environment, etc).So I love these supplements, and the price is about average, nothing bad to say about them at all. However, for things like this I prefer to buy powder (sold by the ounce, or by the kilo) and add it directly to shakes, smoothies, other drinks like lemonade, or even baking.We often drink protein shakes in the morning, and it's easy just to pre-mix the raw pomegranate powder along with the shake mix, so I don't have to remember to add it. The cost of powder vs. capsules is much cheaper, and it's one less pill I have to remember to take. You can actually do this for just about anything, including 1-a-day vitamins. I'm still experimenting with different brands (obviously one bag lasts a *looong* time) so I don't have a recommendation.I haven't decided yet which company is best quality and price, but if you're interested in this method it's easy to find powder suppliers on google, the auction sites, direct from manufacturers, and even on Amazon. I can say that Navitas sells supplements in powder form on Amazon, and it's convenient and good quality, but they are also the most expensive powder I've seen (at about $2.25 per ounce). Though that's still cheaper than capsule form (this whole bottle of Jarrow 60 capsules is 25.5 grams, which works out to about $14 per ounce!).Food for thought - hope this helps!
B0013OXA5Y While this won't get rid of an active prostate infection, it works very well at keeping my husband's prostate issues at bay after the infection is gone.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates and eat them almost everyday when they are in season (I see them in stores only October through January). They are expensive but delicious and very healthy. Now I can have a benefits of this superfruit for the whole year and way cheaper. Of only the pill would taste the same;)
B0013OXA5Y Supports Cardiovascular Function- I have always been a fan of Jarrow and this product hasn't changed my mind. Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets does everything that they claim to do for me. I have used this particular product for about three months. I have blood work regularly done for my high cholesterol, among other problems. I haven't noticed any magical changes, but have noticed a slight dip in my try's and cholesterol. This is great, because my Try's and Cholesterol has continued to increase over the past twenty years and I have used every pharmaceutical medication offered since 1990, as well as watching my diet. To no avail, nothing has helped lower these or prevent the increase until using Pomguard 425 mg pills. I do have heart disease and while continuing my use of mentioned meds, I use Jarrow as a supplement because I'm allergic to niacin, the most common supplement.Provides Antioxidant Protection- I am aware that pomegranates has long been known as an method of antioxidants. I have researched the use of pomegranates and good health for a while. My 94 year old grandmother had pomegranates trees long before the research proved it is an antioxidant. The older southern people relied on home remedies to help with good health and better living.  What I am saying is I truly believe in natural supplements, much like my southern ancestors, that had a long, good life even before they knew of cancer. I highly suggest that anyone of any age use such products.
B0013OXA5Y Potential health benefits per WiKi:In preliminary laboratory research and clinical trials, juice of the pomegranate may be effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including LDL oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation. In mice, \"oxidation of LDL by peritoneal macrophages was reduced by up to 90% after pomegranate juice consumption...\".In a limited study of hypertensive patients, consumption of pomegranate juice for two weeks was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. Juice consumption may also inhibit viral infections[54] while pomegranate extracts have antibacterial effects against dental plaque.Despite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used evolving research results for product promotion, especially for putative antioxidant health benefits. In February 2010, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven antioxidant and anti-disease benefits.
B0013OXA5Y The use of Pomegranate is said to have very rich antioxidant properties, the development if. Supplement makes it easier to benefit from this fruit. The juice itself takes time to acquire a taste, which I still have not, so the pill form is a great idea!
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these for a while and feel better, more energized!! I have not had any negative side effects. Reading up on the ingredients, this is a good formula. I'm starting to really like Jarrow.
B0013OXA5Y Wow, I didn't know that Pomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity!I was taking those ( tea and red wine extract)in supplement form, along with drinking green tea (without milk or sweeteners for its antioxidant properties, definitely not \"yummy\", but best utilized when taken that way.However I have switched to this Pomguard. it is one of those things that I have not \"felt\" any difference but due to the family history of heart trouble & high blood pressure it is just smart to be proactive in this area! Not to mention it is cheaper than what I was spending on less effective antioxidants, so for me it is a great value!
B0013OXA5Y I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure but am currently not on any medication.  Fortunately, since stopping the medication, my blood pressure has been stable.  However, I don't want to take chances.  Jarrow's Pomguard is an anti-oxidant to help with your cardiovascular system and blook pressure.  So far I'm very impressed with it.  I took my blood pressure every day and it never went up while taking this supplement.  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates, but they're not the easiest fruit to consume. Full pomegranates are messy and alternative sources are often quite expensive. That's where these tablets come in.These pills are easy to take and supply you with the antioxidants that you'd get from a regular pomegranate. The pills themselves have a slight odor, but this doesn't really make them harder to take. I've taken them with food and on an empty stomach and there have not been any issuesIf you're looking for more antioxidants in your diet, you should give these tablets a try. They're easy to take and get you all the benefits of the fruit without any of the hassle.
B0013OXA5Y It's best to get your nutrients from whole foods, rather than supplements.  This isn't always practical however.  Pomegranates can be expensive and they're not always in the stores, plus they can be messy to eat.PomGuard contains a wide variety of polyphenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagiannins.  I had to look these up, since I wasn't exactly sure what these were.  I knew they were good for me, but that was about it.  These are powerful antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation.Why I like this product:* The pills are gel caps, small and easy to swallow.* The pills don't have an unpleasant smell, like several other supplements.* It's an easy way to get antioxidant protection.  Plus, each pill has a concentrated amount of the polyphenolic compounds.* The pills are easy on my stomach.  I suffer from gastritis and acidic fruits like pomegranate can make me feel very nauseous.  I can take the pills with no side effects.As with any supplement, you should check with your doctor before taking these.  These can interfere with statins or blood pressure medication.I do recommend these as a great way to add more antioxidants to your diet.  Of course, eating the whole foods is better, but this can be a nice supplement to that.
B0013OXA5Y I liked the tart taste of this fruit, but they were messy and slow to eat, and so these days, I'm quite content taking these easy-to-take tablets.  They offer all the health benefits of pomegranates without the nuisance of eating.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Most sources tell you pomegranates are a big deal super food.  They and pomegranate juice are expensive, however, and the juice may have added sugars to make it tastier so that's added calories.  This Jarrow pomegranate extract is probably the way to go to pay out less money and consume less calories.Depending on what source you read, you can find that pomegranates do everything from help you lose weight to prevent cancer.  There's not yet hard evidence to substantiate most assertions.  However, since pomegranates are rich in polyphenols and have antioxidant value, anyone gung-ho antioxidants will be happy to take this supplement.  There's little evidence you can be harmed and a good chance it may help y
B0013OXA5Y If you're like me, you know you need to get more antioxidants in your daily diet - antioxidants are said to fight against cancer (by eliminating free radicals) and improve cell and heart functions: Jarrow POMGUARD provides 60 VEGETARIAN capsules as a dietary supplement, and includes 100% California Pomegranates.  And I absolutely ADORE pomegrantes, but they available for such a short period every year, so in the meantime (and if you don't eat up a bunch of blueberries instead), this is a great way to get your pomegranate OUT of Season :)...I would definitely recommend!
B0013OXA5Y If I had to name my favorite fruit, pomegranate would make it on the top of the list.  Some members of my family are mesmerized when I spend long time cleaning the big pomegranate fruit.  Others took more practical approach.  They bought me a special tool that cleans the fruit quickly  - but I still find it pleasant to clean it manually; it is almost a form of meditation.When I saw that Jarrow company offers product called PomGuard, I had to check it out.  This dietary supplement is made of 100% California pomegranate extract. Supplement comes in a capsule and it is easy to swallow with a little bit of water.  Directions indicate that one can take 1-2 capsules a day (morning and/or evening).  Pomegranate fruit contains powerful antioxidants.  This particular supplement helps promote cardiovascular function, it reduces oxidative damage from free radicals and supports healthy cell replication.I guess if there was any other way to make this supplement, I would like it to come in a chewable form.  One of the beauty of pomegranate fruit is its juicinesss, which is obviously missing when supplement comes in a form of a capsule.  However, I am still happy my body gets to enjoy the advantages of this heavenly fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I am biased because I like pomegrenate, the fruit itself, and thus I believe in its magic.  That said, I wish I were eating a pomegrenate instead of a tablet but until then, I'll pop this pill every day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates - nature's wonder fruit. Used in traditional remedies for thousands of years, you'll find mention of Pomegranates in many ancient texts and religious writings. Pomegranates are way too expensive for my taste - or daily consumption. Same for the juice, plus there's all the sugars and calories in juice.  If you're looking for the benefits without the expense, calories and mess, this is an ideal option!  Plus since they are formulated using 100% American grown Pomegranates, you can be sure of the quality of the fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I really like supplements, which are derived from a food source, that give me extra nutrition.  As it isn't possible to eat in a single day all the things that keep one healthy, these supplements take the goodness of pomegranates and provide us with two important preventative benefits: antioxidants and heart health.  I felt great taking this product and I am sure it improved my health as well.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because of all the benefits of antioxidants. Products like Pom Juice is very expensive so I figured I could get all of the benefits in a capsule form. I can't really tell a difference physically, but I'm confident that in the long run I will see the benefits. I finished one bottle and ordered a second. You can't beat the price when compared to the juices available.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful Antioxidant solution. PomGuard is a multifunctional supplement helping to support cardiovascular function (blood flow/heart health) as well as a strong antioxidant. Each capsule contains 425mg of Pomegranate Extract. You simply take one capsule a day and you're on your way to better health. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking a fruit supplement.
B0013OXA5Y Everyone, especially those who work out hard or have physically strenuous jobs, needs lots of anti-oxidants to keep their bodies healthy and strong. Pomegranate is one of the best whole food sources of a wide range of anti-oxidants, but the fruit is expensive, kind of a pain to eat, and not always to everyone's liking. Jarrow has concentrated all the benefits of pomegranate into this easy to swallow, and relatively (when compared to the actual fruit) inexpensive product. Having looked at other pomegranate anti-oxidant products, I believe this to be one of the best buys out of all of them considering strength, quality, and price.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not a big fan of taking extracts instead of consuming the actual food that they are derived from. In general, I'd rather eat an actual pomegranate than drink the juice or take a capsule. However, it is not practical to consume the fruit everyday. In fact, there are many foods with antioxidant qualities that are difficult to eat daily. In the case of pomegranates, there are two issues that make them a little harder to eat regularly. One is they are expensive. Another is that the fruit is a little troublesome to extract the edible arils from. In the past, I have purchased them and removed the arils only to find that sometimes they get moldy before I can eat them all and I've also found that I can have a strange digestive response to the seeds on occasion. This extract allows one to have the benefits without the potential problems.If you consider the average cost of a pomegranate, the cost of a 30-60-day (depending on if you take one or two capsules per day) is pretty reasonable as long as this is your main antioxidant supplement. Taking them is a pretty average experience for a supplement. However, these are in the middle of the pack price-wise and not the cheapest option. The capsules are neither too big nor small and are easy to swallow (though they are not specially coated, just normal clear capsules full of deep red powder). They do smell a bit chemical though. Frankly, they smell like glue, though you don't really taste anything or burp up anything odd after taking one (with food).The only down side is that pomegranates are delicious and that there is a loss of the seed nutrients (fiber, oils, micronutrients) if you choose an extract over the real deal.
B0013OXA5Y Admittedly, my family's diet doesn't have enough fruit in it. Due to the high cost of fresh fruit here and the fact that it goes bad nearly right after you bring it home we don't eat enough of it. I've been experimenting with vitamin therapy and these seem to help increase energy.For those that have a hard time taking pills, as I do, these are a normal sized capsule and they are easy to take.Overall, I'd recommend.
B0013OXA5Y Every so often, we are told of a new 'Superfood'.John Kellogg thought corn flakes were a superfood in the 1800s.Red is the new health color, pushing green aside...for the moment. I already take Jarrow anti-oxidant and Resveratrol formulas, so perhaps this is overkill. Still, can't hurt, might help!
B0013OXA5Y I've taken a lot of pomegranate pills over the years they help to keep me healthy. These work as well as any others I have taken and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I drink POM and if you drink POM you know how expensive it is. This bottle is definitely worth the price to get the effects of pomegranate (in my opinion) I'd also rather take these than drink POM myself, as I'm not a fan of the taste. I like the brand Jarrow, is it my favorite? No, but this seemed to work fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y I ignored the whole pomegranate craze until recently.  On the East coast, I rarely ever see fresh pomegranates at my local grocery store.  The one time I did purchase one, it rotted before I could figure out how to open it and eat it.Over the last few months, my blood pressure has been creeping upward.  Whether that is due to gaining a few pounds or perhaps stress, I cannot say.  It is probably a combination of the two.  A friend had recently told me that pomegranates are supposed to be beneficial to blood pressure.  When I had the opportunity to try these Jarrows Formulas Pomguard tablets through the Amazon Vine program, I figured that I did not have anything to lose.I have been taking these for a month now.  At the beginning of the month, my blood pressure was averaging 150/90.  My readings for the last few days have been averaging 140/80.  I have not changed my diet or my non-existent exercise routine.  I have not lost weight.  The main source of my stress is still present (and snoring loudly) as well.  :)I can only guess that these Pomguard tablets are helping my blood pressure.  Of course, you should always listen to the advice of your physician regarding medical treatment and medications.  I intend to keep taking these for the long term.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow is the perfect choice for supplements, because they provide superior quality products at an excellent price that don't disappoint. This potent Pomguard formula is not an exception. It delivers a high dose of antioxidants that work magic on the body. I personally love this product. Highly recommended for its potential health quality and reasonable price.
B0013OXA5Y Pomguard is a good supplement for increasing cardiovascular health and for slowing aging because of its antioxidant properties. It puts the healing power of pomegranates in concentrate. It is easier to use than eating promogranates themselves which have a lot of seeds. Drinking the juice is okay, but this supplement is better if you are looking to avoid fructose sugar intake. According to Dr. Mercola, fructose sugar is unhealthy beyond 25 grams a day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have recently been hailed as a super-food good for the heart/cardiovascular system as well as an excellent antioxidant. Pomegranate juice has suddenly become a big item in health food stores and groceries all across the country as a result. It seems the fruit itself isn't something people like to deal with, despite it actually being much easier to prepare for eating than the tons of seeds lead one to expect. It is also a seasonal fruit, and not a cheap fruit. The solution we've been provided is a capsule containing what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients of the fruit, in particular ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Most of the supplements currently available on the store shelves contain synthetic forms of these ingredients that are almost certainly inferior to the natural, straight-from-the-pomegranate forms. Even drinks advertised as pomegranate juice usually contain only a small amount of the real stuff, so read the labels before buying!It will be years before we know if pomegranates actually provide the benefits we now expect, but it has been a popular medicinal fruit for thousands of years in several cultures. This Jarrow product is the best of the pomegranate-derived supplements I've encountered to date, so I'm going to keep buying buying and taking it.
B0013OXA5Y I'm becoming a fan of the Jarrow Forumulas product line. So far I've been taking these for about two and a half weeks and zero issue. I'm a big fan of pomegranate juice in general so I get my fill of antioxidants both fresh and preserved. These Pomguard tablets are easy to swallow and so far, no side effects. I don't feel any extra burst of energy or anything hyperbolic like that, but nor have I had anything like upset stomachs or things of the sort.  So far, so good.
B0013OXA5Y What are pomegranates good for? Researchers report that they are rich in antioxidants that can keep bad LDL cholesterol from oxidizing. This degradation of LDL seems to be an initial step in the development of atherosclerosis. In addition, pomegranate extract, like aspirin, can help keep blood platelets from clumping together to form unwanted clots.Research has found that pomegranate extract improved the amount of oxygen getting to the heart muscle of patients with coronary heart disease. Other researchers report that long-term consumption of pomegranate extract may help combat E.D. Investigators are also excited about the possibility that pomegranate compounds might prevent prostate cancer or slow its growth. In mice, treatment with pomegranate extract delayed the development of tumors and improved survival Other research reports suggest that pomegranate juice might help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Arthritis may be hlped by this extract due to the reduction in inflammation that results.A little fun fact:The fruit features in Greek mythology in the story of Persephone, daughter of the harvest goddess Demeter. Hades, the lord of the underworld, kidnapped the beautiful maiden. Because she ate a few pomegranate seeds before being rescued, she had to spend several months every year in the underworld with him. According to the myth, that's when the earth was forced to endure winter. Persephone might have done better to resist eating pomegranate seeds, but science suggests that most of us could benefit!
B0013OXA5Y If you're reading this review, you probably already know that pomegranates are a potent source of many types of nutrients. It's hard to get and use fresh pomegranates, so if you're looking for a pomegranate supplement I can recommend this one. I can't address the results of taking it over time, but I do feel like it infuses my system with a wonderful antioxidant support and I trust Jarrow as a company. You get a high concentration of all the active portions of the pomegranate fruit.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great way to add pomengranates and their anti-oxidents to your diet. My stomach has felt better and I feel bet
B0013OXA5Y My husband and I take certain supplements every day for different needs.  We both have low blood pressure so we need to be careful with those supplements that can lower it even more.  Antioxidants are a good way to keep healthy but they can cause a decrease in blood pressure if taken in large doses.  The suggested dose is to take a capsule one or two times a day after a meal.  Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract.One capsule a day is enough for my husband and I take one capsule every other day.  This is the only way we can keep our blood pressure stable and yet get the benefit of the supplement.  This might mean that people with high blood pressure could benefit from the pomegranate extract.As with any other supplement, my recommendation is to do research before any purchase especially if considering taking this supplement in combination with others.
B0013OXA5Y I can't say with certainty but it seems like there is enough evidence out there that this supplement is beneficial to cardiac health.  Jarrow Formulas is a good brand that is well trusted.  The pills are easy to swallow for me and I have had no negative effects.  I am not sure if there are positive effects or not, but research encourages me to continue taking the product.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are a well known source of antioxidants, however, many of us are not able to have an affordable supply of them throughout the year. PomGuard is a great substitute for those times when you can't get fresh pomegranates. In fact, it might even be better, because the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel is used, instead of just part of it.PomGuard is primarily taken for circulatory health, regulation of cholesterol, healthy blood platelets, normal cell function, and stimulating and supporting healthy cartilage life. As with most vitamins and supplements, it is best taken with a meal to avoid any stomach upset. I have not had any problems with off-taste, stomach upset or repeating while consuming these.PomGuard comes in easy to swallow Vegetarian (gelatin) capsules and are made from 100% California Pomegranates. I cannot find any information stating that these are organic or non-GMO.
B0013OXA5Y I chose to rate Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 5 stars because it is a great supplement. The company Jarrow seems to have placed a lot of research into this product, I love the formulationI also appreciate them not adding any additional \"fillers\" to the product, just 100% Pomegranate Extract. It is Wheat/Gluten/soy/dairy free and vegetarian/vegan friendly.I rotate this supplement with a few others to spread their benefits longer. For instance one day I'll take this supplement and another day i may take MK-7, another day I'll take Methyl B-12, etc.Overall, a great supplement for cardiovascular function, fights free radicals and supports heathly cells!
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow talks about the many possible health benefits of their PomGuard product. Among them are: healthy platelet activity, healthy levels of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), prostate, antioxidant, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial benefits, and more.Whether or not those can be substantiated is really a question that I cannot answer in this review.What I can tell you is that Jarrow's product provides the benefits of the entire pomegranate fruit - juice, seed, and peel. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane and seed contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. The PomGuard capsule provides fruit extract from 100% California pomegranates, with nothing synthetic or artificial.I can also say that I've felt great since taking these daily. I simply cannot tell you - without a complete medical exam - whether they have actually contributed to all of the benefits ascribed to the product.
B0013OXA5Y I long ago discovered the wonderful taste of pomegranate during a visit to Israel.  It's one of their revered \"seven species\" of fruits/vegetables (along with olives, dates, etc).  In the process, I learned of the super health benefits of the fruit, especially its antioxidant properties.  Here in the Midwest, one cannot always readily buy a fresh pomegranate.  There are processed juices available, but those are often diluted and/or modified.  Now, this Jarrow Formulas Pomguard allows me easy access to the benefits of pomegranate daily, and at a reduced cost to buying the fresh fruit (granted, I'm missing the great taste experience).This supplement comes in the form of a typical clear capsule containing a brownish powder.  Recommended dose is one capsule one or two times daily after meals, with a capsule providing 425 mg of pomegranate extract from California pomegranates (and nothing else).  60 vegetarian friendly capsules per bottle. Contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, or nuts.  And Jarrow is a highly reputable manufacturer - I take several of their supplements.The label has a boilerplate \"consult your physician\" warning for people with medical conditions or taking medications.  ok.I have experienced no ill or other side effects after taking these.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great and easy supplement.  Once again Jarrow makes a quality product.  The research behind pomegranate is a little fuzzy and people use it for all types of conditions from breathing better to flu treatment to improved blood flow.  I find that it has a moderate breathing enhancement, but it is hard to say if that is weather related or not.  Either way, if you are looking for a pom supplement that is quick and easy, this one is for you.  Personal trial and opinion about what pom does for you is the best course of action.  I use it, I like it.  It helps me, maybe it will help you too.
B0013OXA5Y Good for keeping the blood pressure down. My bp has been creeping up in recent years but I believe that this, plus a couple of other supplements has helped bring it down. I absolutely love Jarrow Formulas, not only are they affordable, but also a very reliable brand.
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements daily for the last 3 weeks and while I can't report any miracles yet, I at least have no complaints either. I've used many supplements from Jarrow before and have trusted them to create high quality products. Pomguard is just as good as the others, in my opinion. The capsules are easy to swallow and digest without complaint.I decided to try taking pomegranate because of how soothed my stomach always felt after eating them. Unfortunately they're very expensive and not always in season, so I wondered if I'd feel the same with Pomguard. The effect is not quite the same, but I do believe I have better digestion after taking a capsule or two. I don't even know if Pomegranate is supposed to help digestion, I know they're allegedly good for many things, but that's how I've been using them. I also feel like I have a healthier urine flow, similar to the effects of cranberry juice. Perhaps my imagination, but so far everything is going well. I'm looking forward to continuing my routine to see if notice any other positive health benefits from taking pomegranate. If I discover anything really exciting, I'll be sure to update my review.
B0013OXA5Y I took this for a month and didn't see or feel any reactions, good or bad.  I don't think it would hurt a person to take this, so I feel it's a good supplement anyway.
B0013OXA5Y If you've never tried it, POM with milk, about 50/50 mix is heavenly.  It's like a milkshake.  But POM is expensive, and buying one bottle a week costs a lot.  Switching to tabs was great, saved me some money and I can still have my POM milkshake when I want.  Eating pomegranates raw is messy.  Takes a lot of time to suck on each seed and then spit them out.
B0013OXA5Y I have to admit, I'd never heard of Jarrow until recently when I started taking these and some vitamin B12. I'd always just gotten whatever was cheapest at Costco. In both cases I've been extremely impressed with the quality. The pills are easy to swallow the nutritional value high. A lot of times I don't care about it, but it was nice to see that it was made from California pomegranates; when it's something that is crushed up you never know what pesticides might be mixed in and at least coming from California you know it shouldn't be anything to heinous.I can't say I feel any different from these pills, but then again I wouldn't really expect to. They're mostly a preventative measure.  One of the purposes of antioxidants is to prevent the growth of cancer cells.  Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by providing the extra electron needed to make a pair or by simply breaking down the free radical molecule. In short, a healthy amount of antioxidants may help prevent you from getting cancer or other diseases or at least decrease your odds.  However, you don't have to much of a good thing or it could become dangerous. It should not take several these pills a day to try to become super healthy or something; you'll probably end up doing more harm than good.One thing you should be very careful about, is interaction with medicines. I have seen a couple of mentions that said that pomegranate may interfere with certain drugs you're taking the same way grapefruit can. If you're taking any kind of prescription medication, I would highly recommend that you actually ask your doctor before taking a supplement like this. Most likely he/she will say it's just fine, but it's better safe than sorry.The pills have no real taste and weren't bad to swallow, though even if you're like me and swallow most pills without water, you'll need some water with these.  Overall, I have no real complaints.  Nice product.
B0013OXA5Y Taking Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful way to get the antioxidant power of pomegranates in a cost effective pill. Pomguard supports cardiovascular function, reduces oxidative damage by free radicals, and supports healthy cell replication and function.Like others who have posted reviews, I have been spending lots of money on pomegranate juice and love being able to get the same benefits for less money.Jarrow's products are top shelf products and I trust them completely.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is reported as a pretty safe supplement to take. It is used for the flu, tapeworms, reversing atherosclerosis and for a few other conditions. I finished the bottle with no ill effects. People with food allergies may want to exercise caution if they have never been exposed to pomegranates. After researching this product I decided that although I feel it is a useful supplement, it is not going to be one that I keep in my routine.
B0013OXA8G I've been taking Jarrow formulas for years, this is a good product.  Phosphatydlserine is a fairly expensive supplement, and this one is one of the lowest priced one's I've found, in a good brand.
B0013OXA8G Years ago, one of my physicians recommended I use this supplement.  I take it at night.  If you research the info on Phosphatidylserine, you'll find that it works at the cellular level and it especially good for brain function.
B0013OXA8G I've only heard good things about jarrow vitamins,  and this product hasnt changed my mind.Gave it to my mom,  but didnt see  any real differences from  when she was taking the &#34;now&#34; kind...I'm giving it 4 stars because I know jarrow is a good company.  Whether the stuff works,  I dunno,  as I didnt try it for me
B0013OXABS &#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I first heard about Coenzyme Q10 in 2007 after reading Dr. Andrew Weil's book \"Healthy Aging\" and it really piqued my curiosity since CoQ10 has the unique ability to increase oxygen utilization in our cells.  Many people still have not heard about Coenzyme Q10 since it is far less publicized than the usual vitamins and minerals.  But in 1978, Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry and part of the reason for the award was his discovery of how CoQ10 helps the mitochondria in our cells turn oxygen into energy.These soft-gel capsules are quite large in size, but I found them easy to swallow when washed down with a big gulp of water.  I have not felt any side effects from taking this supplement.  This is a very valuable supplement to take, especially as you age into your 40s, 50s, and beyond.  I highly recommend this supplement!
B0013OXABS You would honestly think that you were ingesting 1 gram of Ubiquinol when you see the gel cap!These are 3 times larger than the last 100mg Ubiquinol that I purchased. My wife refuses to take them.
B0013OXABS I'm a big fan of this product as it says that absorbs more quickly, and seems to imply more bioavailability.  I've been taking it it for a month and am very satisfied but admit I'm not sure how to evaluate the claims vs reality, but have no compliance data. I'm astifd
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is an antioxidant found in almost every living cell and is essential for mitochondrial synthesis of energy.  It is manufactured by the human body but not in significant amounts so external supplementation is needed, especially as the body ages.  It effects cardiovascular health, neuronal metabolism, renal health, and genes related to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation.  As for energy production, it aides in the production of ATP via signaling pathways and the genes relating to cholesterol, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, which is anti-aging and improves cardiovascular health.  Studies have also shown that ubiquinol improved sperm density, motility, and morphology.  It was also shown to inhibit the release of proinflammatory substances, another cardiovascular disease potentiator. One problem is that CoEnzyme Q10 is not well absorbed by the body but in a comparison, ubiquinol exhibited significantly better bioavailablity than ubiquinone.  I take 400mg per day in divided doses and never miss a day!  I can not say if this formulation is better than any of the others I have tried but this company  has an excellent reputation.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb appears to be a form of highly absorbable and effective Co-Enzyme Q-10, which is what, in powdered form, I have been giving (for years) to my Cee Cee cat who has a very definite heart murmur. At 13, she still scurries around, jumps and plays -- so Co-Q10 may be contributing to HER health.However, she's NOT getting MY Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb, which although a large softgel, IS a softgel easy to swallow, which means it is highly absorbable in the body where it counts -- the stomach, and possibly the gut.Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb has been tested and researched on a control group of people whose results after the study, proved to be positive. I couldn't agree more with this conclusion -- as Co-Q10, formerly a highly underrated/unknown supplement, seems to be exactly what the world needs today for heart health.in addition, \"After about age 45, total Q levels and QH levels tend to decline in various critical tissues.\" And after age 45, we have more than enough stressors to our lives and health to worry about -- it appears the Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinal Qh-Absorb is just what is needed for quick absorption in \"older\" bodies.I have a mild heart murmur -- heart trouble ran in my family. So perhaps Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is just the ticket for my ticker. I continue to take it every day. The price is reasonable, given the healthful effects it appears to produce in the body.Thank you Jarrow, for your research, studies, and the efficacy and purity of your products.
B0013OXABS I have taken Co-Enzyme Q10 for many years, it is an important enzyme for cellular health. Our bodies don't make as much of it as we age. It is important for heart health and oral health as well. A good toothpaste and oral rinse will include Co-Q10 (like PerioBrite, TheraBreath, PerioTherapy and others, you can find all of these on Amazon) as well. Ubiquinol is the advanced form of Co-Q10, which doesn't require the body to break it down so it is more easily absorbed. Qbiquinol is generally more expensive than Co-Q10 (which can be expensive for the higher potency formulas). This is an excellent formula of Ubiquinol. It has a fast absorption and enhanced stability so that you get the full benefit must faster. It is gluten free but does have soy. Jarrow is a high quality vitamin manufacturer that makes excellent products. They focus on creating the proper formulas for their vitamin supplements to enhance absorption and usability. I have used their products before. Ubiquinol is beneficial for us as we hit our 30s and beyond. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure or other conditions, this product can be very beneficial for you. Many good doctors will recommend Co-Q10 and Qbiquinol to their patients. If you have never tried Co-Q10 or Qbiquinol before, you may wish to start with a lower dose of Co-Q10 first and work your way up. If you have conditions as mentioned before, higher formulas will be beneficial. This is an important product to add to your health regimen, just as important as fish oil, Vitamin C or calcium. I highly recommend this product. It has helped to give me more energy and is excellent for heart health. Be sure to take this with a meal and not on an empty stomach. It is even more effective with exercise and a good diet. While we can't always eat right, I do make sure I take my vitamin supplements and hit the gym for exercise.
B0013OXABS Having tried out many of their supplements over the years, and having taken one on a daily basis for years, I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas.  I have taken cholesterol medication for many years, and my doctor has adamantly recommended that I take 100mg of CoQ10 each day with my cholesterol pill so I don't lose energy and become sluggish.  I have purchased a wide variety of CoQ10 supplements over the years, different brands and strengths, usually looking for the best value.Jarrow Forumlas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb provides the benefits of 100mg of CoQ10, suggesting that this formula works better and is absorbed faster by your body.  Both online and in very small print on the bottle, Jarrow provides all kinds of information on how and why this Ubiquinol formula works, and I am not someone who is inclined to study this at length.  If there is something I need to take, recommended by my doctor, I look for the best and most affordable version I can find.  This formula is not the most affordable, but I have to say that, after a couple of weeks, it seems to work just as well as my generic store-brand CoQ10 capsules.  I won't likely know until my next round of blood work if there is any change to my cholesterol, but if - like me - you are pretty much required to take CoQ10 every day, you may want to give this a try to see if it helps.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinal is a reduced form of Co-Q10. What that means in simple terms is that it is the reduced active antioxidant state of Co-Q10. This is the type made by cells in the body and is much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, especially as people age.As it says on the bottle, \"Jarrow Formulas QH-absorb is a proprietary enhanced stability formula, which has been clinically shown in humans to increase Co-Q10 levels up to 777% (6.14X) over baseline at 300 mg per day intake.\"This sounds good to me. These are very big black pills. Serving size, as stated on the bottle, is one per day.Each softgel contains 100mg of Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Kaneka QH is a registered trademark of the Kaneka Corporation of Japan.The bottle states that these are gluten free. Other ingredients as stated are: Medium chain trigycerides, phosphatidylcholine (from soy lecithin), beeswax, rosmarinic acid, vitamin E, and ascorbyl palm itate. Softget consists of gelatin, glycerin and water. Carob extract and caramel added. Contains: Soy.Ubiquinol is a fat soluable substance, meaning it must have fat to be absorbed. I take these with my fattiest meal of the day, to hopefully have as much absorbed as possible. Who knew that the Co-Q10 I've been taking all these years wasn't being absorbed well? I didn't!I take over 12 supplements a day, and Co-Q10 has been one of the leading ones I've always taken. I feel that this particular blend from Jarrow will probably be much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, particularly when I take it with food that has some fat in it. I like the Jarrow brand, since I've known and trusted them for years.
B0013OXABS I first tried DR. Mercola's brand Ubiquinol enhanced CoQ10 about a year ago. I never felt wow energy improvement but I did feel more awake and honestly lighter on my feet. I truly felt \"airy\" if that even makes sense. I noticed a differnce any time that I took them. My memory is not fantastic so I decided to get more and wanted to try the Jarrow brand.. really I got free shipping and two day delivery for free. Plus, the reviews we're great. Well, I have yet to notice any difference in energy or anything else since taking them.  I've been taking them for a week and nothing.I'm 29 years old and take prEtty good care of my health amd am very natural minded so I'm disappointed.  I read that mercola,'s formulation was the bestand now I agree.  Ill be sticking to his brand from now on.
B0013OXABS Not sure if this stuff works well or not as I don't know how to tell. These pills are ginormous. I take 3 a day. They are smooth, black, and really do go down easy. No side effects that I can tell. I take them per regiment suggested by Dr. Steven Sinatra for blood pressure issues.
B0013OXABS I've been taking some form of CoQ10 for several years for its cardiovascular and energizing benefits.  When sourcing CoQ10 (ubiquinol) it's vitally important to get a type that is actually ABSORBED into your bloodstream.  This form is highly absorbable.I like this higher 100 mg dosage of ubiquinol & can definitely feel a difference in energy levels on the days I take it.  This supplement is DEFINITELY on my list of favorites; highly recommended for its quality and effectiveness.See this book by Dr. Stephen Sinatra to learn what you need to know about CoQ10's importance to your health:Reverse Heart Disease Now: Stop Deadly Cardiovascular Plaque Before It's Too Late.  Good luck and good health to all!
B0013OXABS Everything I've read about this product I wanted....all the health benefits. I was eager to try it.  Unfortunately, after each dosage I got the worst, chest crushing heartburn ever.  I thought maybe it was something else, and experimented with taking it on an empty AND full stomach, as well as at different times of day.  I also ruled out other medication or foods that might have caused the heartburn.Still, no better.  Something about this doesn't agree with me and the pain of the heartburn couldn't be ignored. I had to stop taking it.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for awhile and I feel a bit more alert, not miraculously but some.I've known and understood the profound benefits of Co-Q10 for several years now and also paid quite a bit more for it.  \"Ubiquinol QH\" is touted as a \"reduced form\" of Co-Q10-- not quite sure what that means.  Does it mean half the strength (so take double the amount for the effects of Co-Q10)?A very large \"soft\" pill that digests very easily.Good product.
B0013OXABS CO Q10 has been highly touted for some time to be an extraordinarily beneficial supplement.The additional Ubiquinol QH absorb Jarrow formula takes it a step further in providing an additional path to absorption, particularly as the user gets older.It has been stated that absorption levels decline with age.With that in mind, it is anticipated that this formula will be more beneficial.Cons are the price but every CO Q10 formula, worth its 'salt', has been pricey.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a more readily absorbed by the body CoQ10 supplement. According to Wikipedia, it is available from food, but declines with age. According to scientific studies it is antiaging, helps prevent Alzheimer's, and helps the heart and also energy levels in older adults. That is why I take it. You can learn more about it at Wikipedia. I know that Jarrow is a reputable company and they offered a great price on this product, like $30.00 less a bottle than I had been paying. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OXABS Just turned the big 5-0 and i'm in good shape (healthwise) but lately I've been feeling tired and listless. Sometimes to the point of total slothfulness. I was just going to attribute it to getting old. I've known about Co-Q-10 for some time now. But I'd stop taking it as it as not absorbable and expensive. When I saw this product I figured, why not?Mistakenly took a pill at 7pm and eyes popped open at 4am FULL OF ENERGY. Wow. Took another this morning at 8am and within 30 min or so BAM again. Placebo effect? Don't know, but whatever it is I like it!
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a form of Coenzyme Q-10 that is better absorbed. Clinical studies have found that it holds great promise in improving cardiovascular, renal and oral health as well as male fertility. It improves energy and may help in slowing the aging process.I found the soft gels easy to swallow with no discernible side effects. At this juncture it is hard to guage any benefits. Overall Jarrow is a reliable company that produces high quality products. I do feel bet
B0013OXABS I have been taking this cardiovascularly protective supplement for years and will continue to do so.  Great product, easy to swallow gel cap.
B0013OXABS Jarrow is a fine company, and they always produce high quality products. I highly recommend this product. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I would really love to buy these in a 300 mg soft gel. Right now I take 3 soft gels per day, so I would love the convenience of a larger dose.
B0013OXABS How can you judge how well a supplement is working? You can't! However, I have read that Ubiquinol is better than regular CoQ10 in general and I have trusted Jarrow over a few years, so I have nothing bad to say.
B0013OXABS There are rave reviews and suggestions we should take these to maintain heart health.  My husband and I take these on a daily basis but have stopped taking supplements except calcium, d, c, and multivitamins to see if ubiquinol is one of the causes for his headache.  I haven't had a health check up so I'm not sure if this supplement helps or not.  I'm in my late 30's with good health for the most part.  For better health the best thing you can do is eat right and exercise.  Supplements can be expensive and visiting the docs.
B0013OXABS I really like this brand of Ubiquinol.  Very high quality and would highly recommend if you are looking for something to try.
B0013OXABS This ubiquinol is a nice product at a good price.As people get older, their natural supply of coq10 drops, and they have difficulty converting coq10 to ubiquinol, which is an important to help produce cellular energy and to fight free radicals.  In fact, some benefits of ubiquinal are supposedly:  heart health, anti-aging, blood pressure reduction, fight free-radicals, boost immune system and support nervous system, much of this supported by various scientific literature.  Ubiquinol can be directly absorbed, and hence there is some literature stating that people over age 40 should consider supplementing with it.I can't speak to all the alleged health claims, but I can say that I do _think_ I have more energy due to the ubiquinol supplementation.The Jarrow pills are a decent size and swallow easily.  The price is good.  What's not to like?
B0013OXABS When it comes to taking supplements, my stomach usually says \"no!\"  In addition to this, there are many foods that I can't eat so I am always searching for new products that could help me and not throw my stomach into a turmoil.Thus far I have not been disappointed by Ubiquinol QH-Absorb 100 mg, 60 Softgels.  At the present time, I am only taking one per day but I have noticed that I have more energy.  In time, I will increase the dosage and see what happens. Give this product a try; I believe it will make a difference. Believe me, my stomach could get a job as a vitamin or supplement tester. But everyone is different so check with your health provider.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for several weeks and have noticed that my energy level is at a consistently higher level. In addition, QH-absorb(the reduced form of Co-Q10) has been shown to improve heart health and function(as well as to lower blood pressure). There are other various immune and antioxidant benefits but the supplement needs be taken consistently and over a long period in order to attain the beneficial results.
B0013OXABS CoQ10 is a top supplement that probably everyone over 40 should take. This is a very good price per dose and Jarrow products are always high quality.
B0013OXABS I consider this to one of the of key supplements on my must take daily list. Coenzyme q10 is essential for optimal cell function and decreases as we age. If you are taking a cholesterol lowering drug it is even more important to take as statins lower the amount of CQ10 the liver makes. The Ubiquinol version is superior in that it allows your body to actually absorb the stuff more efficiently. So to summarize, if you've decided to supplement with coq10, this is the product to take. It may be a little more expensive but you are more likely to get the benefits in this form.
B0013OXABS I have taken this dosage of CO-Q as Ubiquinol for a few years so I can't say that these are more or less effective. From what I've read, if you are over 40 you want to take Ubiquinol (reduced Co-Q10) rather than regular CO-Q. I was surprised to find that even though these soft gels were of the same strength as my other brand, they were very large compared to the tiny football shaped gels I usually take. They are roughly 1 inch by just under 5/8's of an inch. If you have issue's swallowing pills these are probably not for you. They also contain more ingredients than I am used to seeing, medium chain trilycerides, phoshatidylcholine (from soy), beeswax, rosmanic acid, vitamin E and ascrblyl palmitate. They are gluten free and nut free for those of you with allergies but they do not say GMO free. Though Jarrow is a good company, almost all of the soy grown in the U.S. contains GMO's. I will stop taking these for that reason.
B0013OXABS I am a real fan of Jarrow Formulas Products.  You just cannot beat the quality, and this form of coenzyme Q-10 did not disappoint.I'm a big believe in Q-10 for heart protection, and it's a must for those taking statins or niacin for high cholesterol.  It will help protect you from the muscle weakness/aches that sometimes accompany statin use.The form of Q-10 available in Jarrows has been proven in clinical studies to absorb better in our blood stream than other forms of Q-10.  I highly recommend this product if you want to start taking Q-10.  It is also gluten, dairy, egg and fish free - something you can't say with some other brands.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXABS This is a highly-absorbable &#34;reduced form&#34; of CoQ10 (anti-oxidant). According to Jarrow it has &#34;enhanced stability.&#34; It is a fairly large softgel, so if you have difficulty swallowing, this might not be the pill for you. It's close to an inch long.I always like to cut capsules open to see exactly what I'm putting in my body. Inside of this one is a light greenish thin oily, slightly stinky liquid. Although it's slightly stinky, it does not create any bad burps like fish oil pills. The soft shell consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water, so not considered vegetarian if you avoid glycerin.Serving suggestion is 1 per day, although you can take up to 1 soft gel three times per day.
B0013OXABS This product was recommended by a cardiologist that uses as many natural supplements as is possible to avoid pharmaceuticals. I can only go by the blood work and the doctor's report that I am in good health. It was recommended for heart elasticity maintenance.
B0013OXABS This is a natural supplement that helps boost your energy at the celluar level. I found it to be very effective.
B000A2HDXA I don't play these myself, I bought them for my daughter. They look kinda flimsy but for the price, they are ok for beginners to play."
B000AAGM0M Works well since I got it. I didn't change battery for more than 6 months."
B000ARH3M6 Apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  Very stable.  The auto-locking heads rock!  Folds-up pretty compact for travel.  The optional carry bag is a must IMHO."
B000B6FBA2 Nice design... Small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. I am thinking about getting a 2nd one."
B000B6FBA2 It is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play!"
B000BKY8CU It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there."
B000BKY8CU For me, I can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height. The padding is great, it is lightweight without feeling cheep."
B000BKY8CU I'm a heavier fellow (5'11, 220) and some of the harder benches I've tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions. This one, on the other hand, is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support. It folds up easily and looks to be very well made. 5 stars, no complaints, and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options."
B000BU5V58 I don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.  This one surpassed my expectations.Months into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem.  The pockets are packed with books, tools, and strings.The shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze."
B000BU5V58 A great universal bag. I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body. Has great pockets to carry your picks, strings, and tuners. The padding is better that I expected. It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color."
B000BU5V58 I purchased this for my daughter who is 10.  She is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar I bought her.  This bag has plenty of storage, offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly.  I am going to purchase another one for my guitar."
B000CD1R7K This little foot stool is really sturdy. It stays in place beautifully. No rocking sideways, no wobbly action.If one of the notches doesn't do it for you, you're screwed: There's no gradual adjustment. But the positions it allows make sense for 99% of players."
B000CD1R84 I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this."
B000E0PPG0 2 15&#34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet. These hold up great year round. I will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand..."
B000E0PPG0 It's a cheap speaker stand. Heavier, in terms of weight, than I thought it would be. Cheaply made, the safety pin is kind of a joke. Overall though, it'll do the job. I would not use this at the highest height setting, but one or two notches lower, else it starts leaning."
B000EEHD4I This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well. Try one...............I think that you will love it, if that's what you're looking for."
B000EEHMXA What more can I say? These strings sound GREAT! They play wonderfully, work well together, have a nice brilliant (but not tinny) sound, and are excellently made. These are not going to unwind on you or break easily.Excellent. That's all there is to say about it."
B000EEJ8IM very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced  I use it with my 12 stringer in open g tuning  would buy other products from this company"
B000EEJAWQ i really like these...use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on..  the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it...but once you got it its a fine product..enjoy"
B0063ONN9C Our 14 month old absolutely loves it!!! Hums the theme song all day long!"
B0063ONN9C Cute show.  My kids love it, especially my 21-month-old daughter.  She asks for it by name frequently!"
B0066SB8UQ I love being able to share some of my comic book heroes with my son who is 9 years old. Of course he thinks I should give it a 5 star review."
B006DUK6SM A very good story line. A young dad takes his son in his truck into the woods,in the dead of winter, sees something, locks his son in the truck, cautioning him not to move and goes to explore.  he comes back and his son is not in the truck and not a trace of him.The rest of the plot keeps you in two minds and the endings is quite a shock."
B006FYDKMA Great show!! Looking forward to more episodes! Love what they find, they have given me idea's on how to re use old items."
B006LWHBDA Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper."
B006LYWJR6 An Australian chubby girl who dreams constantly of her wedding and the tricks and subterfuge so she was involved in in trying to reach her goal. A thoroughly dysfunctional family is of no help."

B006OU14BO Well people this is # 2 of a killer Italian girl bad asses show! I love these girls big time! Drama baby! Get it for your collection!"
B0016KV73W Used it numerous times in less than 60 days! My daughter was potty trained the first weekend of November 2013. I took this with us on a trip into my office for a backup plan. She has great bladder control (can last upwards of three hours). We left the office after three hours and put her in the back of my SUV with the potty and me (not a ton of extra room but we managed....wanted to give her some privacy from prying eyes :)) she never saw this thing before. She sat right on it and did her business (#1). This portable solution fits in a large tote or purse. I have used it to attach to a regular toilet on the go (just used it tonight at a friend's house at a child's bday party). Very easy.The liners are good. No leaks. I purchased extra liners too. I haven't tried rigging a regular plastic bag with paper towels yet. Afraid of leaks.With newly potty trained tots, I think you need a convenient solution for an immediate need. Buy it!
B0016KV73W I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the \"wings\" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.  It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag). But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.  (It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.) I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.  It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!
B0016KV73W I love this potty! Much easier to use this then hold my 14 month old son over a regular toilet every morning to do his business! We part time EC, and this has been working perfectly, wish I had bought it sooner! He loves it set up on the floor, & has become much more interested in going #1 in the potty as well!To those complaining that it collapses on their little ones, you don't have it set up correctly. You need to push the legs into the potty base till you here each side click. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on potette plus set up.I purchased the silicone reusable insert for the potty so we don't have to mess with bags... Much greener and cheaper! I bought the potty & liner for $15 bucks, you really can't beat that!
B0016KV73W This is so perfect. We go to the beaches all the time and there are no bathrooms and a child learning to potty can't hold it til we find a toilet somewhere. This works perfect. Small, easy, secure. I love that it also comforts to a toilet seat to put on an adult toilet seat in a public restroom. I use it most though for our beach trips. The liner you can buy for it works great but when I run out and haven't ordered none regular grocery bags work just as well.***edit. Oct. 5th, 2012 I had to order another one since we lost or had our stolen when we were getting some maintenance done on our car and it was in our car :( but soon as i realized it was missing I was online ordering another one because this is the best invention in the world especially for long trips, beach trips, or out anywhere that just doesn't have potties, especially for a little one that can't hold it like adult can, when my 2 year old says I have to potty she has to go and go NOW so its great to have in the car when there just isn't a store or gas station around for her to go potty at. I ordered 3 packs of refills with my original purchase and still have 2 full packs left LOVE LOVE THIS product and so does my daughter she has no problem going on it***
B0016KV73W This seat is such a convenient thing to have! It is small enough to put in a backpack or diaper bag and it comes with a storage bag. It makes sitting on public toilets easier (for kids and parent) and could be its own potty in an emergency. The only reason that I deducted a star is one design \"flaw\" that I'm not sure if they could do anything about. The front bottom is shaped/sized so that if my son's aim isn't down enough, it will actually cause the stream to start splattering. He's usually good about it and it isn't the end of the world to clean up a little, but I think it could be better in that respect. Would definitely recommend.
B0016KV73W This is extremely handy for an outing, especially when potty training a 2 year old. It took me some time to figure out how to lock the legs in place, but it's not a big deal now. My only complaint would be that the legs are so short, so even my two year old's knees end up in his chest. But I guess that's what you get for portable.
B0016KV73W This potty was a total impulse buy for me, before we started potty training my son.  I thought it looked cool, and I was pregnant with my 2nd, so I bought it on a whim.  However, it was SO worth the money!  We are outside a LOT, especially at parks/playgrounds....and I'm not going to lie, I just can't handle the port-a-potty.  I can't do it!  So, this has really saved us from having to pack up and go home early.  We keep it in the back of our car, and just set it up whenever we need it.  We've never really used it as a seat cover, just as a travel potty.  I can fit it in my diaper bag, but it takes up a lot of room.  It would be nice if it were smaller, but for what it does, I highly recommend it!
B0016KV73W My almost 3 year old daughter falls through the opening when sitting on it. She also tells me &#34;it hurts my butt&#34;. It will be in our next yard sale needless to say. I was hoping this would work for her. I even tried putting her foam cushion from her home potty seat on the top and she still refuses to use it. The foam isn't a perfect fit and just makes it clumsy feeling to her. The opening is way too big for a typical child of 2 to 3 years of age in my opinion. My daughter is not petite either.
B0016KV73W We initially got this for our petite 2 year old. He was already going potty in a little froggy potty (also bought on Amazon) and was doing so well but it became a problem when we would go out in public because he was terrified to use the large toilets. So we bought this and it solved the problem! So small and extremely easy clean up. He has even gone in the car with this little potty. Needless to say, he didn't end up using it a ton since he eventually got brave enough to use a normal toilet but we still keep it in our truck in it's nice little bag just in case or if we need to use while on the road. Great product!
B0016KV73W The potette is really portable and well-made, but I think I was happier with my ikea potty - it took up a little more space and didn't fold down or convert to a training seat (which is cool) but at least I didn't have to use plastic bags with it (I don't buy the potette liners - they seem pointless. I just use an old plastic bag and a rag or cloth diaper in the bottom, and then wait until I'm somewhere I can offload the poop without having to send another plastic bag to a landfill). I would love to figure out an \"on the go\" solution for the potette that didn't require a plastic bag at all. On the other hand - the potette is thoughtfully made and small enough to fit my one year old, who much prefers to use a potty than a diaper.
B0016KV73W This was the best buy I could have done for the summer vacation on the beach. We went to Europe on vacation and it is usual  there not to have restrooms available on the beach so I was worried about how to handle my 3 year old potty training phase. I bought this product and it has proven to be phantastic!!! Clean and easy to use and comfortable for the kid. Size is also quite reasonable as it fits perfectly in the beach bag. All my friends with kids same age wanted to get it too.
B0016KV73W I bought this because I needed a portable potty for my son. He is fully potty trained but doesnt tell us he needs to go until he is about to pee himself. I was really tired to hovering him over the toilet (thank goodness he is small for his age or else id drop him right in) especially with a bad back and weak arms. I was really looking into the foldup ones for convenience but saw that it was not sturdy and did not fit public toilets. I am so glad i found this. it folds up nicely and is sturdy. I am so happy i read reviews because i found on another review that to use it in a sitting position/potty you have to push it up to lock in place. Anyways the day i got this in the mail my sister took my kids and me to the park and as soon as we got there my son was doing the pee pee dance. I pulled this out, popped the legs in place, popped the baggy in it, put it behind the tree, shimmied down his chones and plopped him on there. He was a bit confused cuz the bag and all but he did his thing and it was all gravy. We also used it on our toilet at home. He loves it. And i love it. =)
B0016KV73W Seriously, whoever came up with this invention is even better than Henry Ford for inventing cars; hands-down this is the greatest purchase I have made for my 18mo daughter...and we've purchased a LOT!  My daughter said \"potty?\" the other day while in public, and was terrified of me holding her over the big (nasty) public restroom potty and wouldn't go...so in the diaper it was, poor thing. So we purchased this potty on the suggestion of a fellow Mom.I was skeptical, as my daughter is used to a padded seat, that sits on our big toilet (we've gone that route and not a mini-potty...she's done amazing starting at about 16mos~) so I was a bit concerned on whether or not she would understand what this was (when used as a stand-alone potty on the floor/ground):  it came in the mail, I opened it, popped out the legs and locked them in place (**you have to pull them out to standing position, then push them upwards into the seat until you hear them click**) and set it on the floor...she immediately exclaimed \"potty!!!\" and sat down to hang out.  SUCCESS!!  From here on out this new travel potty was my bff.I keep it in it's plastic bag, in our diaper bag 24/7...it paid for itself twice already: having it at my parent's house 3hrs away to pop the legs to the side and put on the big potty, when I didn't think to bring her usual potty seat, and again when we were on the beach and she said \"potty\".  I don't go anywhere without it, ever.It comes with plastic bags that will hook around it, that they pee/poo into when you'er on the go, and inside is a little \"pad\" to soak it all up...don't waste your money on more of these specialty bags...use some plastic grocery store bags, and line them with the thick maxi pads...it's the same exact thing, and a FRACTION of the cost since you can buy cheapo brand pads.BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
B0016KV73W This toilet helped make potty training so easy for us. We brought it to the park, the playground, shopping. I was a little shy using it indoors in public (although would in a pinch so long as I could find a somewhat quiet, uninhabited corner somewhere), but had NO shame whatsoever having my daughter cop a squat at the playground or wherever outdoors. And when we were running errands, I would open the back of my SUV, and have her sit there and go. I would just stand in front of her for safety and to give her a bit of privacy. Also, when I was pregnant, it helped me avoid public restrooms and having to hold my almost three year old over a toilet, big belly and all. I cannot recommend this enough.
B0016KV73W We carry this with us in the car whenever we go out.  It has a little plastic case that comes with it, but we use that to store the bags, and got a separate (washable) bag to carry the potty in.  It's fantastic.  Going out to eat and don't want to balance your toddler on the big toilet seats?  Bring this along, lay it flat and your toddler is comfortable and protected from germs!  On a road trip and don't want to risk a gas station restroom, or your toddler needs to go NOW and you're on a stretch of open road?  No problem!  You click the potette into the \"seat\" position (note that people complain about the seat collapsing, but it won't do that if you just click the \"legs\" into their place.  You MUST click/lock it in to the upright or flat position, otherwise it's not stable), put it in the back of your wagon,  or in the back seat on a relatively flat surface, or on the side of the road even, your toddler sits down and pees/poops, you tie up the bag and knot it (please don't litter - just store the bag in the back of your car, or the trunk until you can toss it in the garbage - if you knot the bag, you don't smell it), and boom, you are on your way!  My daughter loves it - she prefers going on the potty \"in the car\" rather than going into an unfamiliar restroom, and on more than one occasion, it's been a lifesaver pulling over by the side of the road for an emergency pit stop.It's all plastic and is easily wiped down by a disinfectant wipe, and takes up little room when stored flat.  You can buy refill liners for about 50 cents a bag (I got a 30 pack from Wal-Mart for 40 cents a bag), which some might say is costly, but we only use them when we go out, so 30 should last us a long time.  When we ran out of our initial supply that comes with the potty, I did use plastic grocery bags (make sure there are no holes in the bag!) and some left over absorbent pads from my pregnancy kit.  You can save money by going this route, but you either have to carry around a bag of women's panty liners/pads and grocery bags, or do it up in advance and then fold them all flat so they are ready to go.  That seems like a lot of work to me, so we just buy the pre-made ones from Kalencom.The only \"negative\" I can comment on about this potty is that it's not ideal as your primary potty seat for potty training.  I like that it's all plastic for easy clean-up on the go, but we did end up buying a cushioned potty seat for at-home potty training.  When your toddler is sitting for a long time on the potty, cushioning is nice, and our daughter found this seat too uncomfortable when sitting for long periods of time.  However, now that she is fully potty trained, she could use this seat for everyday use at home just fine.Overall, I highly recommend the Potette and it's definitely one of our best purchases for our toddler.
B0016KV73W This potty lives in my car trunk and its great for car trips and has been used more then I thought it would be.  Only minor issue is the seat sometimes wants to close while my kid is sitting on it but I just hold her and for a 30 second potty break it works perfectly.
B0016KV73W Awesome product.  I travel a fair amount and didn't want to delay or jeopardize potty training my toddler because of my fear of getting stuck somewhere without a toilet.  I used this mostly on top of public toilets for the first few months - and it was GREAT for that.  It reduced the anxiety of my little one trying to go in strange places, especially when he had to sit for a while to, ahem, produce.  We used it on airplane toilets, you name it.  Then one day we were about to get on a subway train in NYC and he announced that he had to go pee... I pulled out the Potette, had it set up in seconds, and he was able to sit and pee in comfort (if not privacy!).  You really do have to push the legs hard to snap them into place so it is sturdy - but if you do that, it is strong enough to hold my 35lb little guy without a problem.  I also love that this is super small, lightweight, and easy to carry around.  Can't say enough good things.
B0016KV73W Like many others here, I had to learn the hard way why the standalone potty won't stay put and the legs kept slipping out from underneath my toddler mid-pottying. It's because each side needs to be pushed to lock in. Then the only caveat is that the legs sometimes pop out of the potty when I pull it back out to unlock it but it's a very minor incovenience compared to having the most accessible potty ever, which is so crucial especially when your toddler is potty training...and especially on vacation...to large parks where restrooms aren't always super accessible (not to mention the lines!)...via a road trip. I can't imagine how we could've survived our last vacation without it. Best invention ever (my husband and I kept saying to one another)! I do agree/have to admit that the seat is very small and very low...but any bigger and it would be a bother to carry around. It's difficult finding the balance between portability and usability when it comes to a portable toilet, but this company certainly made it work.
B0016KV73W I had high hopes for this based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment. It's really flimsy and quite frankly too small to be of any use for my 2-year-old son. Despite following the directions, it kept tipping over every time we used it. Don't waste your money on this. I recommend the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty.  We use that now whenever we go out. The quality of the Bjorn is far superior to the Potette.  That's my .02.
B0016KV73W Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.
B0016KV73W I take this chair everywhere with me! It fits sturdily on every type of toilet seat I have tried it on. It has little rubber strips on the underside of the legs/seat support that hold it in place. It folds up small enough to fit in a side pocket of my diaper bag or a large purse. When my son uses it it puts him in the right position to entirely miss peeing on the seat (mothers of boys know this is important). My only complaint is that the splash guard in front is kinda wide. To allow him to sit comfortably I have to take one leg out of his pants and underwear, which also involves taking off a shoe. I don't mind this so much since he just turned two and is peeing in public places thanks to this potty but might be a bigger deal to other people. I have never used it as a stand alone chair but I know that the legs must be positioned to point down and then clipped into place to be sturdy. I have tried that part and found it to be very sturdy.
B0016KV73W This may be the best baby product I've bought. My daughter was recently potty trained when we had to go on a very long road trip through rural Oregon. We were very concerned that she would regress and bought this potty out of desperation. It worked wonderfully! The legs are very sturdy when locked in place and work well on uneven ground. The bags are super and we have not experienced a single leak. We've used the &#34;mergnancy potty&#34; everywhere from the back of the SUV to the park to the beach to the side of an interstate highway. It's compact enough to fit in my big purse, so it goes everywhere with us.
B0016KV73W A travel potty is an absolute must for potty training, especially in the early days.  It is literally the difference between a breakthrough success and yet another accident.  This travel potty is exactly what we need.  It's lightweight enough to fit in the diaper bag.  When the legs are snapped into place (which took me a few tries to get right), it is extremely sturdy.  My daughter feels very secure sitting on it - it's not wobbly at all.  It's a very smart design to allow it to be placed over a public toilet too, although we mainly use it as a stand-alone potty.  I keep a bag already loaded on so that it's ready to go at a moment's notice.  We have used it everywhere:  in the front seat, back seat, trunk, on the side of the road, in the park, everywhere.  The absorbent inserts in the bags are brilliant.  The bags contain messes perfectly; we've never had a mishap.  This potty seat affords us a LOT of confidence that even if the urge sneaks up on my daughter, we will still be okay.  Every potty training family needs one of these.
B0016KV73W We are loving this potty seat for our 19 month old. He is usually slow to warm up to new things, but took to this potty seat right away and has been going potty in public restrooms with no problems now. It fits conveniently in the diaper bag. Haven't used as a stand-alone potty seat yet, but can see that double duty can come in handy too. I like this item way better than my sister's quad fold dora the explorer seat for her daughter - that one is very flimsy and I think my son is comfortable on this seat b/c even though it is small and portable it is sturdier. Great buy for ten bucks!
B0016KV73W So happy with this purchase - and I was sceptical.  1-Because it good TOO many good reviews; and 2-My 2 1/2 year old newly potty trained daughter can be a little particular and dramatic about new things. But I was wrong and made a great choice in my purchase.  It even fits in my tote bag.  It comes with 3 pee bags and a plastic storage bag.  The extra bags and silicone seat insert/liner are separate, but well worth the extra purchase.  The potty does sit very low to the ground, and having a tall child made me think maybe she wouldn't like the way that felt but she is fine sitting low, even though her house potty's are higher.  We use the liner/insert at houses we visit because I can easily dump it and wipe; as well as the bags for in the car or at stores so I can just toss.  I prefer to use the Potette brand bags instead of using a garbage bag with paper towels as some suggested - you never know when there is a small leak.  The bags are easy to use and have little turtles in the bottom pad which make it fun for the child to tinkle on.  The pad is genius - nothing sloshes around!  Although when I have used the silicone insert in the car, I just put paper towels in the bottom and that works just as well. My only, very small, con is manuevering the legs/handles of the pot.  It is not easy.  You have to push each end of each leg/handle all the way in to click, to make it a sturdy sit-on-the-floor potty.  Then they snap out again to fold in to store, or to flip outward to use as a toilet seat.  Our babysitter has issues with this aspect so she actually pulls each handle all the way off, and folds them in and THEN snaps them in to store it. Otherwise she can't go from the locked to the fold position.  Even I have trouble.  But the more you use it the easier it is and it works so well otherwise I will deal with that.  This really is one of the best purchases I've made as a mom so far, it makes running errands with a toddler who doesn't like big toilets so much easier!
B0016KV73W Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  It looks more ring like than seat like.  This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow \"sprayage\" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids \"junk\" and the front of the bowl.  Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
B0016KV73W We are not a fan of this product.  I have the Baby Bjorn ones inside the house which my son loves but he refuses to use this one when we are out and about.  The first time he sat on it it wasn't correctly locked in place and the potty gave way and he fell down.  He's been traumatized every since and now I just bring the Bjorn one along for the ride in the trunk and wasted all of my money on this.
B0016KV73W Great if you travel with a kid in potty training period. It is small enough to be carried around. It can fit even in a larger purse. It is very stable once it is locked in the position. The only problem is unlocking it. I end up with the handles in my hand every time I try to unlock it and I have to put the handles back. I do not know how long the plastic is going to resist to this maneuver.
B0016KV73W Where do I start? I love love love this toilet seat. During my search for a portable potty for my daughter I looked at many different brands and options. But after reading many reviews for this I decided to give it a try even though I worried that it might be bigger than I wanted. When it arrived I knew then its the perfect size. It is such a life saver in many ways. It helped my baby girl toilet train because the kiddie ones with a bucket that you have to throw out is just a bit too gross for me. I do not leave the house without it. I thank god every time we are out and my daughter needs to go but we're at a super disgusting public toilet. I grab a bunch of the seat covers, layer them up and slap this on top and she's ready to go. We've used it in my car too for times that a public toilet is not around which is such a life saver. This way I'm not driving 100 mph looking for the next restroom stop and panicking that she might go in her pants. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B0016KV73W During potty training this has been fantastic.  My daughter learned to potty train in a potty chair, but that meant pleading with her to pee before we left the house, and rushing home before the next &#34;potty.&#34;  Once we got this, it was easy to throw in my (large) purse and off we'd go.  She felt much more secure on large public toilets.  Not only that, you have the capability to turn this into an emergency potty chair by folding the legs down instead of out to the side.  It's great for long car trips because we don't have to race to the next exit to find a gas station.  We're able to put this in the hatchback trunk and just let her go there, in the provided liners (you could also use a plastic shopping bag -without holes!).This is great to even just leave in the trunk.
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!  We keep it in the back of the car at all times.  My daughter is very afraid of &#34;big potties&#34; and this is our solution.  We buy the refill bags and it's so convenient.  I originally bought it for use on a trip and even brought it on the airplane. We still use it now.  On outings I just ask her if she needs to go (usually while exiting or entering the car) and I open up the back hatch of my car, she hops in and goes.  I keep a little pack of diaper wipes in the bag with it.  Then before walking into a store (or the park) I just tie up the bag and toss it in the garbage on my way in.  Nothing to clean up and I don't have to hunch over a public bathroom telling my daughter over and over to stop touching everything.  Sometimes we'll bring it to parks near us that don't have bathrooms.  We've been using this for about 10 months now and are only on our second pack of refill packs.  Totally worth it.
B0016KV73W Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it. We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.  Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.  Once in place it is very stable.  They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.  Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.
B0016KV73W Only use this is a  toilet seat converter for my kiddos.  For this it works well and is nice & compact.  I have a Ju Ju Be Backpack and it fits inside the back zippered change mat section (after taking out the mat which I no longer need) Don't like it as a sit on potty though.  My daughter won't use it as I think it feels unstable to her.  I keep a Cool Gear Travel Potty  in the car for her to use if we can't find a toilet as it's sets up as a sturdy bench seat, it's also higher off the ground than this potette.  Works with the potette bags (or any plastic bag for that matter) so it's a fast disposal just like the pottette.
B0016KV73W We've owned this for a few weeks now and it's simply THE BEST! Every parent with little ones potty training should get one of these! Our girl has used this potty-style in the back of our SUV, in the backseat of our sedan, on the side of the road, at the neighborhood pool, and seated-style on numerous public restrooms. I purchased the disposable bags with these and once I ran out, found a grocery store bag and 2 papertowels folded over works just as well and is more convenient and cheaper than the bags. This potty is comfortable for my girl, easy to transport (comes with a carrying bag), easy to use, easy to clean, convenient, inexpensive and has been invaluable for keeping in the car and using when the moment strikes! Great product! I might consider this my new go-to gift for new parents...even though they'd have to wait a few years until they can use it...it's that wonderful.
B0016KV73W This is the perfect little potty for our uses: emergencies and on long car trips. I love that it can be used as a seat on a big potty, if you have that option, or on it's own with the bags. I have bought the liners that this company makes to go along with this potty because I like the ease of knowing there won't be spills or leaks if I were to use my own. I also like the ease of not having to carry around both grocery bags and something to put in the bottom of them (although that's a great idea in case I ever find myself without one of Kalencom's liner bags!).We are using this as an emergency potty for our kids ages 9, 6, and 2, although the 9 and 6 year old are able to hold it until we find an actual bathroom better than the 2 year old.
B0016KV73W Pros:-has a raised upper lip so i'm not as scared of my boy peeing all over the place-sturdy ring that does not fold, so no worries about it caving or breaking or pinching-can work both as a potty seat or stand alone potty. we haven't tried the latter feature yet, but basically there are 2 folding legs on each side that fold in when not in use; fold out all the way like wings so that you can place on a toilet seat; & can fold legs 90 degrees to the potty seat itself so that it can be standingCons:-on the smaller side, but works fine for my little guy, who is on the smaller side**It's inevitable that whatever potty set you get, the yucky public toilet will be exposed to your child. So, our system is to bring a travel pack of sanitizing wipes and wipe the toilet seat and anything icky and tempting for toddler to touch (like flusher, sanitary napkin box, etc) and then place potty seat on top. Works great!
B0016KV73W It works as intended. We keep it in the car for our daughter and it can be used in public restrooms. There has been a few emergencies while she's been in the car seat. It's easy to pull over to a private spot, set up the Potette, and let her go. It's definately saved us from car accidents. Some people have complained that the legs fly out from under the seat. I have not found this to be an issue at all. The instructions show that when the legs are pulled out they need to be pushed up to \"click\" into the seat. It's solid when pushed into that position.EDIT: 12/2012 -- We still have this in our car. It's been a long time and still have the original one. It works great. No issues at all. Awesome when you are miles from a toilet and the little one says, \"I gotta go!\"
B0016KV73W Maybe this will be more useful in traveling when my daughter gets older, but it's not working for a toilet topper. It slides around too much and doesn't stay where it needs to stay. Also, it's so thin, it's not very comfortable for my daughter. I really liked the idea of this product though. I hope we can use it in the future.
B0016KV73W I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.  I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to try this little potty for an upcoming trip!  The only problem is that our little one doesn't like it.  She is a very petite (21 pounds, 32 inches) 19 month old and the ring is too big for her.  She looks very uncomfortable on it like she feels she is going to fall through.  It also sits too low to the ground for her.  We will keep it around and hope that maybe she will grow into it and it will be a our \"go-to\" travel potty.  But for now we will search for something else.
B0016KV73W This is a great little travel potty and we have also used it as a portable toilet seat for public restrooms.There are a couple of things that could improve it though.  The legs are so short that even a 34 inch child does not look comfortable sitting on it.  Also, do not allow children to fold the chair back together.  It is easy to pinch your fingers if you are not careful.The Kalencom PLUS works as a toilet seat too for public restrooms and it does the job.  However, I do not like this seat as a portable toilet seat for three reasons. With boys the pee can hit the wrong spot and splatter; the seat is lumpy; and it slips a bit on the toilet.  This product is best used as just a travel potty and it is good for that.  It is nice you can put three of the disposable bags on it in advance and be ready for emergency potty stops.
B0016KV73W I can't explain how impressed and happy i am with this product. I bought it for my 2 year old for a camping trip but we had an emergency and we travelled in the philippines. It made our life a lot easier because we don't have to rush and stop somewhere when my daughter needs to potty. We used it when we are out and i don't feel comfortable about my daughter using the public toilets and we even use it inside the car ( i just sit her in the back) .. This product was worth every penny, i highly recommend it if you travel a lot and good for those who are starting potty training
B0016KV73W I bought this product for my twin girls who are almost 2 and a half and we've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's the best travel potty ever! Folds very easily and can fit in a medium-sized bag. Super easy to use. Nice color. We tried another potty before this one and one of my little girls kept saying &#34;it hurts, mommy&#34;. We never had such a problem with this potty. We've traveled with it the whole summer and it's been a lifesaver on so many occasions! I can't imagine traveling without it! I do think that the liners are overpriced but that's not too big an issue -- You can always use this potty with other small plastic bags. Highly recommended.
B0016KV73W My two year old just started potty training and I knew we would need something we could use when we are out of the house. I love that it can be used as a stand alone potty or as a seat on a regular toilet. This potty usually gets used as a stand alone with the bag inserts, which I really like and are biodegradable. We haven't used it for long so I don't know how durable it will be but it does seem to be pretty good quality plastic and will hopefully last through two kids. It's sturdy when the legs are locked in place and pretty small when folded down. Our toddler seems to feel secure on it as it gets used frequently. I'm really glad we bought this and for the price you can't beat it.
B0016KV73W We kept this in the back of the car and used it several times.  It works great, and is so easy to clean up.  Love it!
B0016KV73W We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose. My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues. My only complaint is buying the bags. They can be costly when you use it as often as we do. And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store! I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in. I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof. I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas. Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier. 
B0016KV73W We have loved this potty - it's easily portable and works great at home too.  It's our all around potty for our 2 1/2 yr old.  Some reviewers said the seat was small - we haven't found that to be the case but he does seem less comfortable on it than he is on his little potty that has a foam/rubber ring for comfort (he squirms a little on this seat).  However, now that he's not sitting on the potty just waiting to go, he does just fine on this seat for the length of time it takes him to potty.  I would have given this 5 starts if it seemed a little more comfortable for him.  
B0016KV73W Haven't used it a lot yet but so far this is great.  Has been sturdy and comfortable on toilet.  Haven't used it alone but when snapped in properly seems it will be fine.  Bought another to keep in each car.
B0016KV73W I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.
B0016KV73W We do not go anywhere without the potette in our car!  We have been using the same one for about 2 years now and it is fantastic.  It is small enough to fit in your diaper bag (really, smaller and lighter than you would think) and incredibly sturdy.  Those who commented that it is not sturdy are not properly snapping it into place.  I had this problem initially, but once I got the hang of it, it is sturdy enough for even a very desperate adult ;)  We usually don't bother with the bags - we just find a nice patch of grass on the side of the road (we live in the country) and let the pee hit the grass - works like a charm!
B0016KV73W Caution for boys - the splash guard is a little too short to stop spray from coming out under splash guard and back up onto their pants when used on an adult toilet, and if bag liner isn't on just right - and definitely if you try without any liner.  The reusable liner has saved us lots of trouble and made this a good park/travel potty.  Second Caution is that you have to really make sure to click the legs into place just right or it collapses and pinches small fingers when set up as stand-alone travel potty.  Even after reading directions and thinking I was doing it correctly, it took a friend with the same potty to show me how to really get the legs all the way clicked into place before we stopped having trouble.  We now love it for taking out and about as a small potty.
B0016KV73W I keep this thing in my car, and make sure I take it on every trip. Because as you know, as soon as you leave the gas station....somebody has to go potty right there and then!!! I like that the legs fold, it doesn't take up space! and then you tie the bags and you throw them away! Super clean!
B0016KV73W fantastic product! I recently brought it along to our 2 week trip to China. It was so handy I cant say enough good things about it! Product works perfectly and so convenient. In the hotel room it works perfectly as the toilet seat. When we were out, I have had to use the bag a couple of times when my son had to poo and pee. Toilets were hard to find, CLEAN toilets were very rare, so needless to say, it was a lifesaver! It was however kind of short for my 4 year old son. Even when set up, it was quite short and he was a little uncomfortable but he just had to do his thing and he was off. Still a 5 star for me. If they would make it a little more comfy for the little one would be amazing. Highly recommended for parents with toilet going kids!
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to use with the liners and to have in your car. But when put on a toilet it is a very large opening and no splash guard and not very comfortable. Since the opening is wide, it was difficult for my 2year old to sit for any long period of time. We took it on our vacation but probably won't be doing that again. It's going to live in my car and used for roadtrips and emergencies. On vacation I'd still take another more comfy seat that will stay in the hotel or the fold up kind to use in my diaper bag. The liners are great tho!! Nothing else out there like this seat plus liners.
B0016KV73W I wanted to love this potty. I read all of the reviews and was so impressed by how many people raved about it. I think it would work great for a young two year old. However, I bought this when my son had just turned three. My son is very slim at only 50th percentile for weight yet he complains that the potty is too small and uncomfortable to use. He also complains that it is too low to the ground and he feels like he will fall off of it. So, this travel potty is going in storage until my daughter turns two, when I will try it out on her.I do like the design of the potty. It is very compact and folds up nicely to fit in a diaper bag for easy travel. I did find the legs to be a bit tricky to get to pop out (to set up the seat for use) and back in (for storage). I havent used the potty that much though so maybe with increased use I will get better at popping the legs of the potty in and out.I also have to pass on a trick that has worked well for us when we are away from a toilet with my 3 year old son. If you take a large sized zip loc bag and let him pee in there it works rather well. You just seal it up or pour it out and dispose of it. Obviously, this only works well 1) for a boy and 2) for peeing only.So, in sum, because it is so small and low to the ground be mindful of this if you are buying it for a 3 year old or for a larger sized two year old. And even if your child fits on the seat, if they are used to sitting higher up on other potty chairs, such as the bjorn potty, they may feel awkward or like they are going to fall off when they sit on this low to the ground seat and they may refuse to use it. From my experience with this travel potty thus far, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but since I have it I am going to hang onto it and give it another try when my daughter turns two.
B0016KV73W Potty training is not an easy process. This 2 in 1 potty/seat helps a lot with the process. I take it everywhere with me. I mostly use it as a seat but there were a few times where I used it as a potty and it worked perfect (During a picnic, in the car once when parked..)The bags are expensive but I bought them anyway. You never know when you will need them. It's been a year and I still plenty of them left just because I use this product as a seat more often then a potty (As a potty in emergencies or places with no restrooms or with really filthy ones!!)Great buy :))
B0016KV73W we are about a week into potty training and so far this is my son's preferred potty seat.  we also have a little frog potty and a seat that sits on a regular toilet, but I guess this is the one he finds most comfortable.  I bought the reusable liner and I definitely recommend it if you plan on using this seat as more than just a travel toilet.Cons: I haven't tried using this as a travel option yet.  It seems like it would be kind of difficult at first, as it takes a minute to set up, too long for a newly trained child in my opinion.  I'm not thrilled with it as a seat on a regular toilet.  My son kind of sinks into it and the hard plastic leaves red marks.  Also, it doesn't work with a potty hook and we only have one small bathroom so I need something that saves space.Overall, if my son likes it then it's a winner and I like that it has three functions.btw grocery store plastic bags work well too
B0016KV73W Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.
B0016KV73W My toddler trained early (22 months) and is a little on the short side. Doing our business while we're out and about has been challenging because pulic toilets are so big. AND, I think not having an option for I'm while we're out was sending him mixed messages. I bought this today and we stopped for lunch- he announced he needed to go and he used it right away- no hesitation. In fact, he was even excited because it was just his size. It's small enough to fit in my bag and I'm going to carry it everywhere. I'm not sure how it will be for bigger kids but for my dude it was perfect.
B0016KV73W My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.
B0016KV73W I was skeptical about this one but, as soon as the UPS man delivered it my 2  year old boy wanted to go on it.  I let him go 1 time inside but, told him after that it was an outside only potty.  We have used it at least 6 times in 2 days and I'm mostly very pleased with it.  Setup is very easy (just make sure you hear the click when locking the legs in place) but, the built in deflector is somewhat small.  Until he learns to \"hold it down\" we are going to have to take off his pants and training pants so his legs sit wide enough that \"it\" points down automatically (you Mothers of boys know what I'm talking about).  Also unlocking/folding the legs was a little hard the first couple of times but, it seams to get easier every time.  I looked at a couple different portable potty chairs before deciding on this one.  The other 2 options were both bulky and 1 didn't have a deflector and the other sealed so you had to carry the \"waste\" home and clean it out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this seat.
B0016KV73W This seat is perfect.  After looking at all of the travel potty seat options, I chose to buy this seat for my three-year old for our recent road trip.  It couldn't have worked better.  It has fit on every public and home toilet that we have found.  My daughter feels safe on it and really likes it.  She always asks if I have it, even if we are just going out to the park or store.  Plus, she is most comfortable holding on to it while using it, which means her hands stay away from the public potty.We have also used it once in its free-standing mode.  It worked great!  As long as you clip the legs in properly, it is very secure.  Anyone who has had problems with it collapsing must not have had it clicked in right.The only drawback is that you have to buy their bags, if you are going to use it without a toilet.  But their bags are great -- they have a pad for absorbing pee, and are super easy to attach and detach.  When we run out, I will probably try to use regular plastic bags in an attempt to save money, but will probably eventually cave into buying more of their bags because they are so easy and mess-free.  Plus, since it fits on every toilet we've found, I doubt I will use it in its free-standing mode very often.Bottom line -- WELL worth the money.  Great product.
B0016KV73W I love the idea, and while my 3 year is not opposed to using it when we are out it is SO low to the ground.  I have to help him squat down so far and it looks so uncomfortable.  He has missed it comepletely and made huge messes in the back of my car.  I wish the legs could extend somehow.  Great for smaller kids I guess.
B0016KV73W Just got it for my potty training daugther, who usually needs to go like now.  We now take it everywhere.  We liked the bags, but ended doing what I read in a review, which is just using regular bags with paper towel on them and it works like a charm (make sure the bag doesn't have any holes like many of them sometimes do).  It has saved us from having to put our daughter to pee under a tree, having to stop and look for a restaurant or something, and things like that.
B0016KV73W Yeah, it's a great idea.  Now, does it work?  Yes!  When it comes down to it, people are talking about two things about this seat.  ONE, there might be a issue for boys because the ring is on the small side; TWO, PUSH IN THE LEGS for the stand alone position.  My daughter wobbled over the first time; so I checked everyones' comments, and now it's great.  Bottom line, great for the occasional emergency.  We all have been there in the dirty gas station thinking we will burn EVERYTHING when we get home.  Great alternative.
B0016KV73W LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My daughter is sort of leery of new things. So I was prepared to fight for her to use this. Boy was I wrong&#8230; She wanted to replace the potty seat we have in the house with this one that I bought for the car :)It is very sturdy. My daughter is 32lbs and not sure of the stat but very tall for her ago (almost 3 years) and she uses it just fine!
B0016KV73W After using this for a few months in my house for my 3yr 2mo old granddaughter, I put it away to use only for trips to the park, beach etc. and bought anotherArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Varyfor my second bathroom that she uses. Here's why:1. The portability of this product is great for use outside the home. It folds easily and compactly. It also can be used as a standalone toilet when nothing else is available.2. So what's the problem with home use? When the legs are pushed up and locked into place, this just isn't stable on the toilet seat. My granddaughter has complained that sometimes it \"pops up\", which is absolutely true. Unless your child sits perfectly in the center of the seat when sitting down, and also gets up without shifting weight to one side, this seat will indeed pop up. That problem doesn't exist when using this as a standalone potty since the legs are facing down.Bottom line: This is a very handy item for day trips, but not something I recommend as a regular potty seat at home.Update April 28, 2014: I've been taking this along when we go out to different places to eat. It's relatively compact to bring, and since I don't let my granddaughter go into a public bathroom alone (unlike when she uses the bathroom in my house), I just hold it in place so it doesn't pop up when she uses it.
B0016KV73W This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).
B0016KV73W Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.
B0016KV73W What a great concept and easy to use.  I have a potty training 3-year-old and a long commute each day.  My daughter goes to daycare in my office building, so unfortunately she must endure the 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes she can't make it until we get to our destination, so having this travel potty stashed in the back of the SUV has been a lifesaver.  Not only does she think it's fun to use, but even if I don't have easy access to a trash can, the liners do an excellent job on containing the urine until I can safely throw the bag away.  Some people have suggested the use of plastic grocery bags instead of buying the liners.  Unfortunately, I find grocery bags often have small unseen holes in them and do not have the wonderful absorbent pad inside.  Spend the few extra dollars to get the liners that are intended to be used with the potty - you will thank me later!  I also like the fact that the potty comes in a nice storage bag - it keeps it clean while sitting in the back of the SUV and is a great place to store the extra liners.  We don't go anywhere without this potty.  No matter how hard you try to get your toddler to use the potty before you leave somewhere that has a toilet, we all know that it will be only 5-10 minutes later when they actually decide they have to go.
B0016KV73W I bought this to potty train my daughter before she turned two. Because I was able to be consistent even when we were away from home, she was daytime potty trained in 3 weeks. We liked this so much that we keep one in the car at all times, ready to go, for those really inconvenient \"Potty-potty!\" calls on the road. We travel with this one also. Imagine a full restroom in Disneyland and not having to wait for a stall because you have this. If I had to wait for a stall, we would have had a mess to clean up. I just put down some paper towels on the ground in a corner of the restroom, pull out the Potette, let her sit on it to do her thing. There was some mommy-envy from moms in line for a stall. They asked me where I got it. My 21month old son is nearly daytime potty trained after two weeks. I must say that this is best for 18-24month olds because of its height. For boys especially, one has to be very careful to aim downward or a stream of urine could easily arch up & out.Buy this and you will not regret it when your little one is in big kid underwear and you can be fearless about getting to the potty \"in time\"!
B0016KV73W Once my son was potty trained in the house and we started to go on outings without pull-ups, I knew we were going to need to have an easy-access potty in the car  I actually traveled with the bijorn potty a few times (not a great idea.)  One day I saw a mom friend pull out a Potette for her daughter during a stroller workout at the park.  It was so compact and easy, I knew I had to get one.  So far it hasn't failed me (except the first time I used it without reading the instructions first and didn't \"click\" the legs in place and it collapsed as soon as my son sat on it.  Whoops...user error...)We've used this for long road trips, birthday parties hosted at parks where the bathrooms were far away or just plain filthy dirty, going on a hike, and at the beach.  It lives in our car, tucked in it's baggy, and behind a box of Kleenex.  I seriously don't know why anyone with young children wouldn't have one of these!***Seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from those who failed to lock the legs into the seat.  This takes a little finesse:  You need quite a bit of pressure to pop the legs in, and just the right amount of pressure to \"unlock\" and fold back in.  If you pull too hard, the legs just come detached. Best advice is to practice set-up and take-down a few times before needing to use it.***
B0016KV73W You can't beat the price for this Use-it-anywhere product!  Seriously... I am a first-time and one-time Mom to a beautiful little girl.  I also get squeamish/freaked-out with the thought of her using public bathrooms and the porta-john at the local park.  I'm not a full fledged germaphobe, but the thought of her sitting and holding onto these toilets is beyond gross!This product can be used as a potty seat over any toilet we've encountered AND... here's the best part:  this potty seat can also stand alone and be used as a portable potty chair with a fantastic bag-insert with a biodegradable gel pack to absorb urine.  I've used this for sudden announcements from the back seat declaring, &#34;I gotta make potty right now Mommy!&#34;  We pulled off the highway and found a safe spot to park the car (an office park with lots of trees and a few sparsely parked cars), I assembled the potty chair within seconds and Her Nibs was doing her &#34;business&#34; with comfort and a bit of pride (early in potty training).  We've used it as a stand alone, at the park, and the beach.  just set it up and sit her down... a little blanket or towel for privacy is a nice courtesy for everyone involved as well.  When she's finished we do a quick wipe, up with the pull-up, and I simply tie the bag handles in a knot and toss in the trash.  It's that easy.  I am now going to give this potty seat as a baby shower gift in the future (there are neutral colors).BOTTOM LINE:  Best value for the multiple-setting-use and money.  Super Easy to use.  Sturdy and Safe.  Portable:  fits in my back pack and diaper bag and comes with a plastic drawstring storage bag for hygienic storage.  A must-have item for parents and kiddos who are potty training and are on the go.
B0016KV73W I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.
B0016KV73W While potty training is one of the least enjoyable experiences of toddlerdom, this potty is a great addition to the process.  We purchased 3 different ones and she uses this one the most.  We use it at home on our regular toilet with a step stool and when we travel.  It's sturdy, light, and obvious portable and works really well.  Out little almost always chooses this one over the other two we have.
B0016KV73W **Edit. I lost it in a public bathroom and I'm more heartbroken than I should be. I loved this toilet. It made life easy. Mess free.I went and purchased some... crappy kushie folding toilet seat cover and... I hate it. It's nothing like this one.I know it's just a potty, but I really miss it.I think it only adds to my review that I miss this thing so much. It fit 99.9% of every toilet I ran into, minus one that it was a tad too big for.. but the rubber grips still held it on there.There isn't another potty out there like this one and the sooner I get a replacement [it's been two months. -sigh.-] The better.-SIIIGH.-**I didn't buy mine from Amazon because I was too cheap to pay shipping so I found mine on Craigslist instead. Why these parents didn't like this seat I have NO clue!! It's amazing. I bought 10 bags from an ebay seller for 9 bucks thinking I was buying the potty seat before I found it on Craigslist. Got an e-mail a few days later saying they'd accidentally sent me 90. Oh no, what is a girl to do? Now I have a ton of lined bags which is GREAT for when we're out. Parks, deserted parts of the mall if we're a long walk away from a bathroom. I just love it. I threaten my mum and my son's father about ever losing it and what I'll do to both of them if either of them leaves it somewhere. x3 so far they've been very careful.I would recommend this for any parent who's starting their child on the road to potty training young. The bonuses of this seat are;1. It folds up VERY small. Perfect for in the stroller or over night bag.2. It assembles very, very quickly. Even when getting the bag on which can be a bit loud/annoying to do depending on where you are or what time it is. [3am, I don't want to hear a crinkley bag and taking my son to the regular toilet wakes him up too much. I'll be buying a potty special for my bedroom quickly. One that doesn't depend on bags to be a free standing potty]3. Great for younger children just starting to potty train. The hole itself iiiis a bit small, I admit. Nothing to little for my 1.5 year old. I started him on the potty at 14 months and found I was never making it to the bathroom in time when we were out. This has helped me calm down and know that even if I can't find a bathroom I can pull this baby out, pop a bag in and not need to worry about changing a diaper.=D \"this is definately a buy.\" - Fruit Gushers review kid.
B0016KV73W We have only had this little potty for a short while, and it has been a lifesaver, and so easy to use. You DO have to push the legs up into the seat until it clicks when you have it in \"seat\" position, not seat-topper position, to get it to be sturdy. There are no instructions on the package, so other reviews are the only reason I know this. Once set up, it is very stable, although short. But the shortness is what makes it so compact and easy to travel with, which is just fine with me. Of course, the ring is small, but I have a 2 year old the size of a three year old and she fits great. The vinyl bag it comes in it very handy to keep it contained when not in use. Some people have said they throw in in their purse, but it really is way too big to fit in a normal-sized diaper bag if you want anything else to fit in there. The vinyl bag is large enough to leave extra bags and wipes in there. The potty fits regular sized grocery sacks, so you can just put one of those on with a paper towel in the bottom and save a ton of money on the overpriced refills. I love this little potty- don't hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence about it!!
B0016KZZG2 This item works great, doesn't leak, semi-hard-to-clean, but still ok. The only real problem I have with this is not the product itself, its the fact that my son LOVES to squeeze the water bottle so the water spouts out way up in the air and then all over everything. If your child doesn't do that, I'd say yes, buy it. But beware the squeezer!! Not a good fit with that one! :)
B0016KZZG2 I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them. They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so. I wish I got other toppers instead.
B0016KZZG2 This is a good spill proof top as long as the one using it doesn't squeeze the bottle. It does leak if the bottle is squeezed. I wouldn't recommend for use with anything but water, because water doesn't stain.
B0016KZZG2 Air gets trapped and the bottle caves in. Would not recommend these. Good concept but doesn't really work well.  Waste of money.
B0016KZZG2 These are great for babies and toddlers. My twins love water. So I send them to preschool with mini water bottles & these lids. (plus my one year old can use them too) The teachers send them home with the twins at the end of the day. All my friends love them when they come to visit because their kids won't make a mess in the house when running around with their drink. I would suggest it to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q Nothing wrong with the product itself, but after purchasing and using for a couple weeks with my newborn, I realized that changing pad covers are NOT worth the trouble (and someone please tell me why I thought brown would be an appropriate color... It hides the poo?). After throwing one away because it simply wasn't salvageable, the second one was neatly folded in a closet where, 10 months later, it remains.
B0016LVB4Q Durable cover--it's held up well with multiple washings so far (3 months) and stains come out well (using Bac-Out and sometimes OxiClean). Currently using it over an IKEA blow-up changing pad, so it's a generous fit; but it fits our other change pad. The cute \"bumps\" on the fabric are going away on the area that gets the most wear--the side where my baby's bottom/back lay while changing--which is disappointing. Doesn't look as nice now, so I give it only 4 stars.
B0016LVB4Q I absolutely love this changing pad cover. It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable. I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed. Definitely worth the money.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this for my son's changing pad.  We had some ugly yellow ones we got at a consignment sale so I was ready to get something that went with his decor a little bit more.This is perfect!  It washes up soft and didn't come apart.  The bumps give texture for him to feel while I am changing him.  You really can't go wrong with this cover!
B0016LVB4Q I love these covers so much that I bought 3 of them - they will get spit up on and peed on so be sure to have at least 1 extra to put on when the other is being washed. I got 3 for this purpose. They are SO soft and add a great touch of texture and color to the room.
B0016LVB4Q So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.
B0016LVB4Q Love the softness of this cover. Nothing much else to say since it's all in the description, but I'd definitely buy again. And of course I'd buy at amazon a million times over babies-r-us; they are such a rip off. Free shipping with prime and no tax with amazon, you can't beat that!Also, fits mySimmons Kids Contour Dressing Table Pad with Non-Skid Bottomand any other standard changing pad. Just don't buy that changing pad for the non-skid (because there is no non skid!!!!)
B0016LVB4Q We have this in fuschia too.  It's so soft, really nice to put your baby on.  The chocolate is a deep, rich color which has not faded with washing (I was this in cold with our dark clothes).  It looks nice and serves its function.  I'd love one in lime green, Carter's {:-)
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover; it fits perfectly and snugly, it looks nice, and it is really, really soft (and it's brown, so it does hide stains.  Unfortunately, I would also say that this is one of the least useful baby-related purchases I made - I never use it.  I did use it at first, but it got pooped and peed on constantly and I quickly realized that it was stupid to cover up the plastic, wipe-able changing pad with something I needed to wash every time.
B0016LVB4Q I have no complaints about this cover. It fits well and is soft. There is really nothing special about it. I might like it better if it didn't get soaked so easily.
B0016LVB4Q I am pleasantly suprised by this purchase.  The cover is very soft for the baby and (possibly more important) not cheesy looking like many others I've seen.  It blends right in with our decor.
B0016LVB4Q I have had these covers for over a year, and I still love them.Pros:They are soft.They match the jungle theme in my baby's nurseryThey do not show a single stain after over a year of useThey wash and dry very well. No pilling and still very soft.They are affordable.Cons:They are not organic.Overall, I am super pleased with this purchase and it is one of the few items I bought for the nursery I would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q It is a perfect fit, just like people were saying in the other reviews. I actually ordered two so we have an extra.
B0016LVB4Q I love the fabric and how soft it feels, just right for a baby. I haven't had my baby yet so I don't know how will it turn out to be after several washes, although my mom just washed it for the first use and nothing happened to the fabric yet. Hope its a good buy so that I can buy more of these things in future. I think amazon has the best price too, so thanks :)
B0016LVB4Q These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...
B0016LVB4Q We are pleased with this product, though it is quite expensive, if I must say so. I think it's going to work out nicely with our changing pad. We got a large, 4-sided changing pad, and it fits pretty well. I mean, it doesn't hug it like a glove, but we are okay with that. It is going to provide the function that it was designed for quite nicely. I would probably not recommend this for smaller changing pads, as it may be too loose on them. I can see a baby grabbing on and pulling it right off in the middle of a changing, which might spell a messy disaster...
B0016LVB4Q The pink cover was very close to the color pictured. I has remained baby soft even after repeated washing and air drying. I also purchased the same cover in off white at a local store and they both are holding up extremely well. Extremely pleased with this product!
B0016LVB4Q i will not return because its a bit of a hassle, this looks nice its a very pale pink!the fabric feels a bit thin, not sure how long it will last...worth the money tho if u don't want to spend a whole lot
B0016LVB4Q We have 3 of these in different colors/styles.  Like some other reviewers, we also use the keep-me-dry lap pads on top of the changing cover to catch accidents.  Have washed these many times and they still look great - very easy to care for and a reasonable price.  They are also super, super soft, which we love for our Little One.
B0016LVB4Q All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a \"fluke.\"  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft!  It's comfortable for the baby and is nice looking.  This pad holds up extremely well in the washing machine.  The material seems to be of high quality and like it will last for some time.  I will say if you get some stains on it get to them quickly because they will set into this pad.
B0016LVB4Q Pros:-Soft... in fact, still as soft as the day we opened it and it has been through the washer/dryer 8 times now!-It does not hold a stain! We bought this in the Ecru, and it has been covered in bright yellow baby poop about 4 times now, and each time it comes out of the washer as clean and stain-less as can be! I was sure we ruined it after the first \"explosive baby poop\" fiasco, but it does not have a SINGLE stain on it.-It still looks brand new and like I said, it has been through the wash 8 times! Normally fuzzy fabrics like this don't hold up in the washer/dryer.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad is super soft but it stained so easily! Every time it got a little bit of diaper cream on it, the spot of diaper cream turned gray in the wash. After a few months it looked so terrible that I threw it out. I bought a yellow one and the same thing happened. My son is 10 months old and very squirmy so it's nearly impossible to prevent diaper cream from getting on the changing pad. I have 2 terry cloth changing pad covers (1 white, 1 blue) that do not get the same gray stains. I definitely recommend terry cloth over this material.ProsGood Size And FitNice PatternSoftConsStains Easily
B0016LVB4Q I did not think I was going to like this and only bought it because it was recommended to go with the changing pad I bought. But I was pleasantly surprised at how soft it is. Looks good and feels well made. Have not washed it as yet but I hope the color does not fade.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and has a nice snug fit over the changing pad. If this is your first child, make sure you have three changing pad covers. We started with two, but I quickly found that three made things easier and I didn't feel like I was always having to do a load of laundry because the changing pad covers were dirty.
B0016LVB4Q This was a great product at a great price. I like how it is less bulky than the fleece ones sold at Target so it is easy to store. It is soft and has held up well in the 7 months we've used it.
B0016LVB4Q I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B0016M10C8 I got these so my son wouldn't have his bare back on the cold plastic changing pad when we change him. My changing pad doesn't have a belt, so the slits are useless to me but they don't bother me or get in the way. These are nice and they wash well. We always have one on the pad and if he wets through it then we can quickly swap it out for the second one while the first is washing. I like these much better than the plastic thin Boppy brand ones I got at my baby shower.
B0016M10C8 I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!
B0016M10C8 These pads are of great quality. I gave it 4 stars because its not what i thought it was. i was looking for changing pads only, not changing table pads. I want to put them in my diaper bag to use when we're out and i need to change the  baby. I don't want to use them on the changing table, which is what its intended for.  I will keep them because they are really nice and thick and soft and i can still use them in my diaper bag.
B0016M10C8 I thought these changing pad covers would fit the entire changing pad... but they only cover the flat middle part (on our Graco pack'n play it's the part that is tan in the middle) which is ok, but our little guy is getting bigger and bigger everyday and his entire body doesn't even fit on it (he is only 3 months old). I like using the pad covers because they keep him from laying on the cold changing pad, but with these his feet still hang off. He hasn't seemed to mind, so I give the product a 4 instead of something lower, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't cover the entire changer!
B0016M10C8 I knew before purchasing this item that it was small. I knew that it would only cover the bottom of the pack n play changing pad to offer protection from the hard cold plastic. I have not used them yet as they were a shower gift, but they have washed well and will fit perfectly in the bottom of the changing pad and provide protection which is all I need it to do. My friends who own these say they hold up well and are a must buy.
B0016N3SF4 I like this bath set, it was a cute change from yellow ducks. drawback is the plastic rings deflated days later, but the frogs are durable
B0016N3SF4 My son is still too young to play with these but I love them at bathtime.  I use them to distract him (2.5 mo old) while his dad washes him down.  Not sure how long these will keep his attention but they're so cute.  I was concerned about how long the air would last in the rings but after 1 mo in the tub they are still filled and buoyant.
B0016N3SF4 I play with it as much as a baby does. Very nicely done. Idea of floating rings with frogs on them is just unbelievable. Would recommend for any age.
B0016N7IJ6 We've used these several times when going out to restaurants with the kids. They work really well and keep the kids occupied while we wait for the food. The only thing I don't really like is that if the kids put their food on the placemat, they can sometimes get crayon in their food! But it's either that or they put their food directly on the table, which may or may not be clean. The adhesive stays put during the meal and comes off easily. They're priced well and worth the time to use. I'd recommend them!
B0016N7IJ6 We picked some of these up at Babies R Us and we love them.  My son is now 2 years old but we've been using these since he started eating solid food.  Their biggest advantage is that (unlike Table Toppers) they are meant to color on and they are big.  I also like that they are made of paper and not plastic.Previously we had usedNeat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat 30-Count.  These Classy Kid placemats are much better than the Table Toppers for a number of reasons.These placemate are wonderful because they:-  have adhesive on all four sides of the placemat (Table Topper only has adhesive on top and bottom sides).-  are big and cover a nice size area; pretty much all the area a young toddler can reach from his high chair.-  are made to go over the edge of the table.  So if your kids likes to play with the edge of the table or even tries to chew on the edge of the table these placemats have you covered.-  Best of all these are made to color on.  They come with a pack of triangular crayons.  My son loves to color these.  It has saved us a lot of trouble when food is taking a long time to come out.-  have different settings with either farm animals, or jungle animals, or undersea creatures on them.  It gives you lots to talk about with your toddler and lots to color!We will continue to use these placemats as long as my son continues to eat food off the table.  He's getting better at using a plate but still.  We really have not found anything better than these.  Although they are a bit hard to find you can either buy them online or at Babies R Us.
B0016N7IJ6 If you take your kids to eat out you have to get these placemats! They are the best out there.Pros:They are huge! They cover every part of the table your child will touch including the side of the table!The pictures they have to color are fun and entertain my daughterThey come with crayons! Which is great into its self but not only that they are triangle shaped crayons so they don't roll off the tableThey also are easy to store in my diaper bagCons:The only con is that the bottom part that is supposed to stick on the table is not as sticky as it could be. The rest sticks fine but the bottom one you have to press very firmly to begin with and also during the meal depending on how long we stay we end up pressing two more times but its not that big of a deal because most placemats out there don't even have the option to cover the side of the table. Anyways I highly recommend this product.
B0016N7IJ6 I love these placemats. It's easy to peel off adhesives and stick these to a table. The adhesive sticks fairly well. When very determined my little one can pull up the adhesive, but it actually re-sticks pretty well. I appreciate that these are are disposable and biodegradeable. We don't use these at home, but do use them when eating out to allow our little one to eat off the table without worrying about germs! My older daughter no longer needs these, but sometimes asks to use them to color on, which can be a welcomed distractions. These are one of my favorite kid products!
B0016N7IJ6 This has been one of the few 'convenience' baby items that has really lived up to expectations. They are so easy to keep in the diaper bag (unlike some non-disposable place mats that inevitably get taken out because they take up so much room) and unfold into a nice big rectangle.They are very waterproof - we are always pleased to find that when we peel up the place mat and it doesn't show any signs of falling apart or leaking through. However, even though they may get covered in water and other liquids, we were surprised to find that we were still able to color on them. Even though my son is not yet 16 months, we can keep him entertained for at least a couple of minutes with coloring on the mats and talking about the different animals and plants depicted on them. The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus. Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon. They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them. I will update the review if we get around to it.As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off. Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)Fabulous product!
B0016N7IJ6 They're huge, they glue down on all four sides, the images give me and my daughter something to talk about during lunches out, and they're biodegradable. What more can you ask for?
B0016NHN82 My baby loves this inflatable tub!  When she was able to sit up, we started using it.  She sits more securely in it without sliding all over the whole bathtub. I love how it has a little loop holder on the back side of the tub for hanging. I use a shower curtain hook to hook through the loop holder on the inflatable tub and hang it on the towel rack in my shower. Convenient!  It's sturdy material and has remained inflated with no leaking.  I wish this tub had been available years ago when my other children were babies!  Overall - one of the best essential buys I've made for my baby.
B0016NHN82 Those plastic newborn tubs just won't cut it around the 6 month mark. Filling up a full-sized tub on a nightly basis is a waste of water. The Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub is a perfect in-between. It allows for a deep bathing experience without using much water. It is a tight fit in the bathtub, but not unworkable. Blowing it up is a pain in the neck, but once it is blow up you only need to top it off every so often. I could care less about how it is decorated, so if esthetics is important to you hopefully another review can fill that need. This is a great tub and should be a registry essential.
B0016NHN82 Love this tub. It fits perfectly in my shower stall (since I don't have a bath tub) and my 7 month old LOVES it. The bottom gets kind of slippery so he slips backwards but if you had a foam pad it would work perfectly in the bottom. I have no issues with this at all.
B0016NHN82 I purchased this item to put in our camper.  We only have a shower in there and I needed a way to bathe my child when she was a baby.  We used it from the time she was 4 months old to the time she was 20 months old.  She got too big for it them and was used to being in the shower with me by then.  This tub stored very easily for travel, was easy to clean, easy to fill with water and was easy to drain.  My child loved using this tub.  She had room to play when she was smaller.  Toward the end, she didn't have room for her boats in there with her, but it served the purpose we bought it for.  We will certainly be saving it to use with our next child.
B0016NHN82 I have a 6 month old daughter who can sit up pretty well but still needs some support once in a while. She didn't seem to really enjoy the infant tub anymore because she doesn't like to recline long, and sitting up in her infant tub was kind of awkward for us to bathe her. We had started bathing her in the big tub with one of us in the tub with her, but it was a pain to fill the whole tub (even if it was shallow) every time, and to get in with her. This inflatable tub is the perfect in-between tub for us! It hardly takes any water to fill, but still stays warmer longer than the infant tub because it holds more water. It fits in the big tub with room for us to sit behind them in the tub or on the edge if we wanted without getting wet in the tub with her. It's soft for if she starts to topple over. And it's got a slight texture so it's not just slippery plastic. A bonus for her is that her bath toys can't get too far away from her. =) The one thing is something I had read in another review: because of the width of the walls, about half the water from the tub faucet ends up going down the drain when filling unless you use a cup or something to divert the water into the small tub. I'm currently looking for a faucet extender like thePrince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/PinkorAqueduck Faucet Extender, Aquaextenders that would work for a tub faucet (with a spout cover) instead of a normal sink faucet, but in the meantime, I found that using one of the cups we use to rinse her off does well to divert the water into the tub. Luckily, the tub fills so fast, I'm not sitting there holding the cup for long. =)
B0016NHN82 We love this baby bath! Our daughter is 8 months old and was starting to get too big for the hard plastic baby bath and yet not quite big enough or steady enough to go right into the bathtub, so this inflatable tub is the perfect transition! She absolutely loves it, it is fully enclosed and has a plug in the bottom and a hook that you can hang it up to dry inside the bath with! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
B0016NHN82 We've been using this little tub for the past few months.  My son is now 9 months old and he still fits in it just fine.  I love it mainly because I don't have to worry about his bumping his head against the sides of the bathtub, and because it uses little water, I don't have to fill the whole bath tub with water and it's comfortable for him.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an infant that can sit up.
B0016NHN82 I use this for my 3 month old, we have been traveling a lot so the bulky infant tubs are not an option for us. We use this and it's great b/c it packs up in a suitcase easily and my son can lay in it with a little water. He enjoys it!
B0016NHN82 This is a very durable, high quality tub. I would definitely recommend this fine product as it's worth the price.
B0016NHN82 My 1-yr-old daughter HATED the regular tub when we tried to stop using the plastic infant tub.  Cried through every bath.  We bought this and she loves it.  We inflated it and let her play in it in the kitchen first (no water) and she climbed in and out over and over.  Once she was in the tub and in water, she splashed and played and just loved her bath again.  What a relief!  It's not very slippery on the bottom, either.  She suddenly got up on her hands and feet twice to turn herself around and didn't slip at all.
B0016NHN82 This is fabulous we have bought others in the past and none has lived up to our expectations other than this and I would recommend to anyone we bought for travel and it is so handy !
B0016NHN82 I chose this tub because the reviews said it was non-slip. They were absolutely true!!! My baby is starting to move around a lot and she has never slipped! I'm glad I bought this tub and didn't transition to adult tub from infant tub because she cried a little when i first put her in, but she got used to this tub fast. I don't ever deflate it. Ijust flip it over when done bathing to dry off.
B0016NMIOG We used this on a trip with our 11 month old daughter when we went overseas and it was exceptionally useful. The container is great and keeps things clean when you're traveling. We used these for a while even after our trip was over. At first Amazon or the company that sold it to us--by mistake sent us disposable spoons by accident but after notifying them of the mistake, either amazon or the company that sold the spoons sent us the correct product. Easy as pie and great service. Now that our daughter is 15ish month old she can't really use them anymore since it isn't deep enough to spoon a lot of food, but its ok...we still found these great when she was the appropriate age to use it.
B0016NMIOG Wasn't sure if I'd actually use these, but we find ourselves out and about and randomly stopping at restaurants or eating at friends' houses frequently, so I figured I'd try it.  Have to say, it is GREAT to just keep in the diaper bag and have handy for that.  Our toddler isn't quite old enough to be able to handle standard sized silverware yet, but these are small like the ones he uses at daycare.  Perfect to have at the ready, easy to clean, and the container keeps them clean and makes them easy to find in the diaper bag.  Every time I have whipped these out, I have received comments from friends that they have never seen anything like this and that it's such a great idea.  We originally bought because we'll be travelling to see family w/ no kids, and this will be perfect for that too.  Highly recommended as a diaper bag staple.
B0016NMIOG This travel set is helpful to keep in a diaper bag for a young kid who is just learning to use forks and spoons.  The flatware is a great size for kids' fingers, while the travel case keeps it handy and easy to find.  Then, as your child gets older, the case is the perfect size for a child's toothbrush and travel size toothpaste!
B0016NMIOG We have bought 5-6 different kinds of flatware for our toddler and the Take and Toss is our favorite.  I tend to buy the more expensive product thinking it will be superior.  For once, that is not the case.  The Take and Toss has no sharp metal so toddlers don't poke themselves while learning to maneuver their forks.  They are also the perfect size for a toddler's mouth.  It surprises me how wide some of the other flatware out there is.This travel set is my favorite!  It is on my list of must-have's and I add it to all by baby/shower gifts.  This lives in our diaper bag.  Not only is it handy to have when eating away from home, but it doubles as a toy until the food arrives.  My little guy loves shaking it and taking the utensils out and putting them back in, over and over.  It's small, cleans up easily, and is cheap to replace when a spoon accidentally gets buried under a pile of wet wipes.  Highly recommended!
B0016NMIOG Got these for a recent family vacation. I love that the container keeps them contained - clean or dirty. When we came home these became a staple in our diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I always carry these in my diaper bag when we go out for outings to the park or to eat out, and they come in very handy! The container is compact and holds just enough utensils, and keeps the utensil from soiling other items in your purse after use. The utensils are easy for my toddler to use, and I always wash and reuse them instead of tossing them. Because they are so inexpensive, it's not as much as a loss when I lose one of the utensils (which inevitably happens when you have a toddler). I boughtThe First Years Take & Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Pieceas spare utensils to use at home and replace in the container.
B0016NMIOG I bought this to keep in my diaper bag so I have child size silverware when we go somewhere. I love the case that it has. It beats having them in a plastic bag all the time! I've even pulled it out to entertain my child with. It can be used as a make shift rattle and my son loves to take the top on and off. Overall a great product!
B0016NP0ZA This thing held up GREAT... for like a week then it would never, ever stay stuck to the wall anymore. Which is a shame because the lady bug toy holder looked so cute and neat on the wall... but i refuse to drill holes. I WISH this would work like it says... but my lady bug just sits on the tub floor now after use.
B0016NP0ZA We got the Boon Pod, Ladybug and wanted it above our tub, without having to use adhesive to hang it. This is perfect. Followed the instructions to clean and let dry the surface on which it will hang. Works great.
B0016RSDYG Really beautiful, modern design. I was worried it did not work together with my mattress (nook pure) but it fits nicely. As other reviews pointed out, the paint chips easily. I attached a mobile to one side of the crib and it got damaged, but I would not complain about quality either. Happy with it. Would recommend.
B0016RSDYG I did extensive research into a modern-looking and sturdy crib that won't cost me an arm and a leg. This Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 crib fits the bill. Setup was easy and the whole thing definitely feels solid. Much better than some of those flimsy looking entry lines - including the $200 Ikea cribs.I did also consider the Babyletto Mercer 3 in 1, but ultimately went with the Modo because there is enough clearance under the Modo 3 in 1 for my Roomba to move in and out. With the Mercer, just be aware that the bottom of the drawer almost touches the ground, so you won't be able to either vacuum or sweep the area underneath the crib - and that area ends up becoming a dust landfill.
B0016RSDYG I have had my son sleeping in this crib for over 3 months and am very happy with it.  I put it together by myself in about an hour and a half.  I took my time and moved a little slower knowing it was made of soft wood.  There were a few steps that would have been easier to complete with two people.  The wood is a little soft and I did make one ding in the wood on the inside, but this would have been avoided had I waited for my husband to get home to help.  Very sturdy once assembled.
B0016RSDYG My wife and I are having twins and we recently purchased two of these cribs.  We put both together last night and I have to say it was very easy to assemble and seems to be very sturdy.  Probably took us 45 minutes to put each one together at the most.  The materials seem to be very good quality and the crib actually looks better than cribs that are much more expensive.  One thing to note is that both cribs we received already meet the new CPSC standard for full size cribs even though that standard doesn't go into effect until June 28, 2011.  Babyletto (MDB \"Million Dollar Baby is the parent company) were great about responding to my email and confirming that the cribs we had conform to this new standard.  Overall we are extremely happy with this crib.Update:  We have now had our twins for just over two weeks and the cribs seem to be very comfortable for them.  They actually sleep better in the cribs than most other places, i.e. bouncy chairs, etc.  The cribs are solidly built and have worked great with no loose parts or creaks/rattles.  Overall still very satisfied.
B0016RSDYG This crib is beautiful, and I love it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it looks great in our nursery. Amazon really does have it for the best price (I looked everywhere), plus free shipping on such a large item was wonderful. It came undamaged and well packed.
B0016RSDYG I've used this crib for my daughter who is now 7 months and we've had no issues with it what so ever. That being said she's not standing up in it yet so I'm yet to lower the mattress yet. I like the style of the crib and it fit our criteria cause we were looking for a crib that didn't convert into a twin bed cause we didn't care for the look of the head and foot board when used as a crib. Plus you can 'float' this crib in the center of the room which looks great.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib quickly and the packaging was intact.  No dents, bumps, scratches in the crib pieces when we opened the box and everything was packed neatly and efficiently.  I was 5 months pregnant when the box came and I assembled the crib mostly by myself in less than an hour.  Needed my husband to help me hold a few things in place, but only because I'm somewhat clumsy!  Assembly was very easy and I love that the fasteners are placed discreetly so you don't see a bunch of shinly metal screws all over.We love the simple, more modern design of the crib and the finish is beautiful.  Very pleased with the aesthetics.  I did bump into it with the vacuum (I said I was clumsy!) the other day and leave a little ding, but I figure it's furniture for a kids room and it's going to get a little beat up.  I had read reviews that the wood was a little soft and dings easily so I was not surprised to see that my vacuum bump left a mark, but I guess I just expect that any baby/kid furniture is going to get beat up over time so that was really not a huge issue to me.As I write this I am 6 months pregnant, so we have no little one using the crib yet and I cannot review based on usage.  But based on packaging, shipping, assembly, and appearance we are very pleased!
B0016RSDYG I bought this crib for my 2nd baby, who is on the way.  The first time around, I spent WAY too much money on my DS's nursery furniture, buying all the conversion rails (from crib to toddler bed to a full-sized bed), etc.  At the time, it seemed so wise, but honestly, I don't think I want to keep the crib until my son is fully grown and ready for a full-sized bed.  But since we spent so much $ on it, I feel like I have to keep it longer than I would otherwise have wanted.  With the Babyletto Modo, the price is great.  It is very en trend with the espresso and white combination, and I don't feel like I have to keep it for more than a few years.  It is just as sturdy as my son's pricey crib, and seems like it will be durable enough to handle our next child, at least through the toddler bed stage.  I also like that it is low enough for me to be able to put a sleeping child into it even when we eventually will have to lower the mattress.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib.  It's made with solid wood (no toxic particle board) and has a lower profile, which makes it a bit easier to put the baby in when its set to the lowest setting.  It's a no frills crib, which is what we wanted, so it takes up less real estate in my son's nursery.  The wood is quite soft, and we have accidentally dinged the edges with the vacuum, which I am really bummed about.  It set up very easily and is also pretty light, so you can move it around if necessary.  Fits standard crib mattresses.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib! When I was looking for a crib I wanted a white one and a more modern one. I looked at many many cribs and most of my ideal cribs were way out of my price range. I kept coming back to this one, so finally took the plunge and made the purchase and am not disappointed!It came from Amazon in perfect condition. The step up was super easy. The directions were easy to read and follow. My husband put it together in no time at all. It is a bit lightweight, but I didn't expect it to be heavy with the price we paid.This is our first baby so I don't have any experience with other cribs but I am 5'1&#34; and this crib is a great height. I don't imagine having any problems with putting baby in/ getting baby out.
B0016RSDYG Purchased a second one for my second child. Great modern look and doesn't take over the whole room. highly recommend
B0016RSDYG This is a great crib -- streamline, compact, sturdy, strong, etc. We had it as a crib for almost two years and had no problems whatsoever with it.However, when we transferred it to a toddler bed, we found that the side rail doesn't fit in flush. See the pictures and you'll know what I'm talking about. There is a big gap and shows the mattress under the rail. Furthermore, it shows screw holes that are no longer in use. We were extremely disappointed because it looks like a piece of junk now.I would recommend this bed for anyone wanting just a crib. Skip it if your plan is to convert it to the toddler bed with rail. Or even without the rail as you'll still see all the screw holes on the bottom and the mattress will slide.
B0016RSDYG I ordered this through Amazon and it came within 2 days.  My husband and I spent about an hour putting it together.  The instructions were ok, could be better but we figured everything out.  We had enough hardware and there were no damaged pieces.  Whew!  Everything looks really good and sturdy but I haven't officially used it since the baby is not here.  However, the assembly was good and the wood wasn't as cheap as I read in other reviews. I'm happy with it so far and love the color, finish and look.  I ordered the Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress to go with this crib and it fits perfectly!  One of the reasons i picked this crib was because it is geared towards shorter women like myself and the price point was good for me.  I'm still debating on the dresser as I heard really bad reviews.
B0016RSEG8 This is a great portacrib mattress. I bought it because there have been some studies which suggest that SIDS deaths may be related to fire retardant chemicals in infant bedding and the lack of some newborns to process it well. This pad is firesafe through the use of a different, not so chemically laden process. In terms of what buyers said about the pad's thinness, newborns do not need the kind of thick mattresses that adults think of as more comfortable. (In fact, I once heard it put very well: In terms of SIDS safety, \"If the mattress looks like it would be comfortable for you, no newborn should be going anywhere near it!\") The comfort comes in whatever soft, lovely, tight-fitting material you lay over it. I used the chenille sheets by American Baby Company - although for said reasons, I wished I could find something truly organic (not just an organic surface as I saw with some products). I was impressed with the pad - it looks and feels very well made, and I don't know how on earth they got an all-cotton surface to be waterproof, but it feels remarkably impermeable without sacrificing comfort. The pad is very firm, more so than many other baby matress thingies - the other reviewer should have nothing to fear. The only concern I think people should have with the thickness of the mattress is that you need to make sure your sheets - which may be designed with a thicker mattress in mind - don't bunch up and become a crumply surface the baby could slide around in too much. If you run into such a problem, safety pin the corners of the sheet's underside together to make it tighter on top.
B0016RSEG8 I got a replacement for my original one because I felt it was too soft and had too much &#34;give.&#34; My baby is a belly sleeper and she sinks into this to the point that her face looks like it's in the mattress.  The replacement had the same issue.  They indicated it's because I was using in a Graco and the support is not intended for this, but it has the same issue even on a hard floor.  I have their full-size mattress which I absolutely love.  I would only recommend this mattress for babies who are over 6 months of age and are NOT belly sleepers. Then I would think it would be fine. I wish there was a similar option in terms of organic but the only other option is not as natural as this one is.  I felt others should know about this possibility with this  mattress because I feel it is a safety issue.
B0016RSEG8 I own a full-size Naturpedic crib mattress and love it.  It fits tightly in the crib, isn't toxic so there's no issue with off-gassing as with traditional mattresses, is lightweight enough for me to handle it easily, and is rock hard so there is absolutely no question about its safety.  When I needed a portable crib mattress I decided to try Naturpedic, despite the steep price, because I expected the same.  I was somewhat disappointed when the product arrived.  On the positive side, it fits snugly around the edges, leaving no gaps in the portable crib.  Also, it is the firmest portable crib mattress that I could find, and I tried several from Dream on Me, LA Baby, Colgate, and even Mamadoo.  Naturpedic uses the same Air-Core technology as it does in the full-sized crib mattress.  However, the problem lies in the waterproof organic cotton cover which does not fit tightly to the core of the mattress as it does with the full-size mattress.  The cover has a rippling effect and tends to bubble when the baby is placed on it.  I use it with the Grayson portable crib made by Babyletto.  The mattress dimensions match the portable crib dimensions perfectly, so that's not the issue.  The rippling issue caused me a great deal of stress when I received the product because my baby has just started rolling over onto his belly at night and I was concerned that this would create a suffocation hazard.  Because we've been staying in a hotel for a month (our home was majorly damaged and had to be repaired), I was forced to use this mattress as it was the best one that I could find, despite its flaws.  It has caused me many sleepless nights (but no scares).  There isn't a portable crib mattress that I have found that I could wholeheartedly recommend.  I still believe this is the best portable crib mattress out there.  Use this if you absolutely must use a portable crib.  Another tip, only use a tight fitting fitted sheet, preferably NOT one made of jersey, as the jersey sheets tend to stretch and, in my opinion, become a loose bedding suffocation hazard.  Instead, use the Naturpedic organic portable crib sheet or any traditional cotton sheet that matches the dimensions of the mattress, fits tightly, and has all around elastic.  And DON\"T use a mattress pad cover with it as it makes the mattress softer.  If you have the choice, stick with a traditional, full-size mattress in a full-size crib once your baby is rolling over.
B0016RSEG8 After searching for a natural organic bed for our expecting baby, I decided to take a chance on this one after purchasing the Da Vinci Crest 50 Coil mattress which was made with PVC toxic material. Even though the previous mattress fits perfectly with our Da Vinci Mini crib, when it was a sunny day and the nursery got a bit warm, there were obvious fumes coming from the mattress since it's had PVC. I didn't want to chance it so we decided to buy this one. This pad was extremely firm and doesn't have a smell. After placing the same brand mattress pad and sheets on, it was slightly snug for the crib but still works.
B0016RVLZY I loved this product when I first opened it... no foul odor and it was much more substantial than the mattress that came with my bassinet. After a single usages by my 8lb baby, there was a huge indent which was dissapointing. I've continued to use the mattress, I just rotate it and try to fix the indentations every night!
B0016RVLZY When I purchased a bassinet for my daughter, I did not like the flimsy mattress that came with the bassinet. I began to look for a new mattress for the bassinet and found this. Make sure you measure the bassinet before ordering this item. I did and it fits well. A friend of mine didn't and it doesn't fit her bassinet.After 2 1/2 months of continuous use, the mattress is still holding up well. It is starting to take on my daughter's impression. It would be nice to \"flip it\" to even out the wear and tear on it but it does not appear that that will work. Hence the four stars.The price has gone down since I purchased my bassinet too.All in all this is a good mattress for the price and is a much better option than the standard flimsy mattress that usually comes with a bassinet.
B0016RVM4O Yes, it seems to be comfy, and I feel better about using this than a plastic/vinyl sheet for all of the obvious reasons. But I don't really consider it waterproof. Fortunately in my daughter's first year we've had very few leakage problems at night, but the first time her diaper did fail her, I removed her sheet only to discover this \"waterproof\" pad was wet through. There wasn't a huge leak, either, my daughter's cloth diaper had just slipped out above its cover and wicked moisture up, through her jammies, and onto the sheet. But the pad still did not prevent the mattress from getting wet. Maybe it helps for minor things, drool and whatnot simply by providing bulk between sheet and mattress, but I wouldn't count on it for anything major. Really wish I had better things to say about it.
B0016RVM4O This is a great crib protector pad. (Pee pad)  It is flat which makes it easier to change.  The materials are also healthier than any other waterproof crib pad I have found.  I have a non-waterproof crib mattress so just in case, I have the fitted one and then this flat one on top of that.  I keep the fitted one on at all times and I only change the flat one.  I have 2 flat ones, one to use and one to wash.  We haven't had any leaks so the fitted one is still clean.  It does take a while to dry but that doesn't bother me.  I just put it on low heat and set my dryer for 50 minutes.  A longer drying time is well worth the benefits of having healthier bedding materials. Use low heat to make sure you don't damage the waterproof membrane.
B0016RVM4O We received the item, but the item itself does not seem waterproof. The underside does not seem to have any type of sealed backing and it looks that any type of liquid would nonetheless seep through the pad.I wouldn't recommend it.
B0016RVM4O I bought this to put over our Naturepedic Lightweight Classic 2 Stage mattress for extra protection. It seems like it's made of heavy duty canvas so am sure it will hold up to any messes. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (vs. 5 for all our other Naturepedic items - crib mattress, changing pad, cradle mattress) is because this is probably overkill if you have a naturepedic mattress already.  It's very thick and I got this instead of the FITTED crib pad because those reviews made it seem like the fitted pad took a long time to dry.  Either way, it's still great quality and would be great if you don't have a waterproof mattress to begin with.
B0016RVM4O Need to return it as it is -way- bigger than its size and we cant fit it on the crib without it bunching and causing a hazard. Just measured it - it is 31x54.
B0016RVM4O We have not had a severe leak yet so i can't speak to that yet.  but minor leaks and spit up it does great.  the fit is a bit big but when we put the fitted sheet on top we dont have any issues.  would definitely recommend this one!
B001708AS6 I bought these for my daughters nursery and they look great. They are a perfect pink! Buy at least two of them (depending on window size maybe more) to get the bunched look.
B001708AS6 I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.
B001708AS6 I wouldn't be surprised if every baby girl room has this! It is the cutest thing in existence. Just barely pink, it looks great with any style...sleek and modern, or antique/vintage. I'm not a fan of pastel, but on this i was sold. it's whimsical, inexpensive and well-made.
B00175ROGU She doesn't pay too much attention to it, but every kid is different I guess.  The product is fine, she just isn't into it.  Which is weird, because they had one at daycare she was totally into which is why I purchased the exact same thing!  But now she's not.  Go figure.
B00175ROGU I give this to my four year old in stressful moments. He doesn't look for it - so no &#34;binky&#34; issues - but I like to have it on hand. This was Christmas vacation so I used it a LOT because he was off-schedule and had a hard time going to sleep. This really helped a lot.
B00175ROGU Durable and fun for my 23m son. He has oral motor issues and suspected SPD and this has been great. We trace the outline of his mouth around his lips which reflexively works his facial muscles, and he loves the nubby texture on his tongue. The only improvements I'd make:*Something to attach it to his shirt safely (he likes to chew shirt buttons and sleeves)*I wish it weren't hollow. This is often used as a whistle, and his drool comes shooting out the hollow end, which is pretty gross.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a nice, soft rattle for our baby... but it's the only one we have that she couldn't care less about.  Maybe it's too \"boring\" looking for her?  She'll reach for it when handed to her, but she quickly drops it in search of something else.  Also, I personally wish I had noted it was made in China before purchasing.
B00175YU7G I loved the idea of an organic teether for my son, so I purchased this bear. However, since day one of introducing it to him, he has showed little to no interest in it at all. It is rather stiff and doesn't have the best rattle. He used to suck on the hands occasionally, but now has completely lost interest in this toy altogether. For the price, I would not purchase this again.
B00175YU7G This company used to be great and then it was bought by a larger company. Says organic but it is made in China and stuffed with polyester. Not too organic if you ask me.
B0017AE3BO The brush does a good job and serves it purpose.  It's nice that it can pump out a little bit of baby shampoo/wash (whatever you put in it) but it requires a lot of pumps and doesn't really lather or anything like that.  It's really more useful to wash a baby's scalp because of the bristles and not really a necessity for infants but nice to h
B0017JB6HY My daughter was less than 5 pounds when she came home from the hospital and this swaddle wrap was the one that fit her best.  It is very easy to get baby in and out of this wrap and it was much more difficult for her to free her arm from this wrap versus the Halo Sleepsack.  She is now 8 lbs and the wrap is a little tight on her already.  There is no way this swaddle would fit a bigger infant - I would recommend getting a bigger size if your baby is 7.5-8 lbs or more.
B0017JB6HY We have 4 of these and they are wonderful!  We swaddle under his arms because I don't like things too close to his head and he pulls his arms out anyway, but these keep him warm and happy!
B0017JB6HY not worth the money for me. I'd rather just wrap my baby in a blanket, like a burrito..she'd get more use out of that anyway. She only used this product about 4x. by the time she was around 2 months old, she was too big for it.
B0017JB6HY it was just ok - either my baby was super strength baby or I just wasn't wrapping her correctly, but she would bust out of it every single time. I did much better with a big swaddling blanket and swaddling her the old school way - i probably only tried to use this a few times and gave up.
B0017LCZEU These are great for creating memories in your home.My wife and I struggled with trying to get our child to put his hand into the print without bending his fingers (trying to grab the clay) but ultimately after trying a few times (rerolling the clay) succeeded. We bought an extra set to produce more so that instead of giving each of them (our set produced 2) to our parents and leaving her with none&#8230; she will now have this precious keepsake as well.Things to keep in mind here&#8230;-clay doesn't dry in 1 o 2 days; ours took probably 5  days and had to be flipped over so that bottom could dry-product cracks slightly depending on how it dries (read instructions carefully)-Ribbon provided is green, yellow and pink so if you have a boy and produce two of these you'll have to use the neutral color as wellGood product.. cost effective for 'imprinting' a moment in the life of your child and yours.
B0017LCZEU So the kit has the ability to make two keepsakes, which is great as it will make Christmas presents for both set of grandparents. Really easy to use. Just have to make sure the clay is soft. Made impressions of my lo's hands then left them out to dry. Once dry, I'll attach the ribbons and wrap for presents. Wonderful idea.Update: they dried really well and truly hard. Both sets of grandparents absolutely loved it and can't wait to display it. So good that I'm buying another set to keep for myself.
B0017LCZEU These did not turn out good at all even after following all the directions. They dried very cracked as opposed to a smooth surface as pictured. I do not recommend.
B0017LCZEU We haven't made these yet... they are going to be Christmas presents for the grandparents. Can't wait to make them with my son! :) (He's 8 weeks)
B0017LCZEU This is another must have, we put her little foot prints up every Christmas, I'm so glad I got this!
B0017LCZEU Used these when my baby was 2 weeks old. Very easy to work with, and they turned out great. Definitely recommend!
B0017LCZEU Finally I found one that worked! It was great. There wasn't a strict time limit so if I wasn't able to get a good print, I just started over again until it was right. It dried in a few days and stayed hard. I would do it again.
B0017LCZEU I loved making keepsakes of my baby's hand and foot. The instructions were clear, and easy to do. There were 3 ribbons to choose from. Pink, blue, and yellow.
B0017LCZEU This kit makes a great Christmas gift or a way to commemorate baby's itsy-bitsy feet and hands for yourself and loved ones. I purchased the keepsake kit for a memento of my son's hands and feet. It contains a sealed package of the molding clay, three ribbons (pink, yellow, and blue), a pointy straw for making a hole, a dinky little roller that's not up to the task of rolling out the clay efficiently, a large round cardboard cutter, and basic instructions on how to create the ornaments.I strongly advise adding parchment paper to the list, not just to protect your countertops or table, but also for allowing the ornaments to dry. The hardening period takes anywhere from 4 to 7 days, and the parchment paper ensured the back of the clay was not exposed, disturbed, or crumbly. Parchment paper also makes for easy transfer.Making an ornament is straightforward. Roll out the clay to desired thickness, fight with your squirmy baby's reflexes to spontaneously curl his toes or contract her precious little hand into a fist, press down gently for an impression while your newborn honks blue murder, and then examine the results. With some luck, you may have a reasonable impression and an infuriated spouse co-opted into this special form of infantile torment. Didn't know that babies generally refuse to spread their fingers and adorable little toes when asked? Well, now you do. My husband decided to roll out the clay again for a second impression, and a third, at my insistence because the ravenous claw marks scratched over the white surface rather resembled an attack by a very tiny, very persistent velociraptor. Not exactly what I had in mind for enshrining my 8-week-old's most precious extremities.Once you do manage to gain an impression - preferably after a bottle of wine, I'll note, but not if you're the nursing mother - then keep it inside the wooden frame for best results. Drying may be a smidge slower, but without risk of cracking or falling apart by some act of circumstance. We used a large round cookie cutter in addition to the cardboard ornament cutter provided; between the two, the metal cookie cutter worked far better for clean edges and punching through the clay. The cardboard was shorter and flimsier.The results are very attractive though. Note for an average sized 2 month old baby, two plaques is all we managed to eke out without some creative positioning.
B0017LCZEU Product worked exactly as the package stated.  I had plenty of clay to make 2 keepsakes and had a little clay left over.  You do have to press firmly on your child's hand to get the imprint but the clay was moist enough that I could try again if I didn't like results the first time.  Since my daughter is only 6 months old, I had enough room on the edges of my keepsakes to add little christmas buttons for some color.  Fun project.
B0017LCZEU I bought this and it was so easy to use!  The only hard part was getting my 7 month old to not move her hand when I was trying to make the imprint, though the foot was no problem. I think it would be smarter if next time I did it with a with a sleeping baby!  I was actually able to get four great ornaments out of this set, though I did not make extremely thick ornaments. I made 4, 1/8 inch thick ornaments,  The clay was very easy to use.  I used a bigger straw than the one given as it was much easier to thread the ribbon through.
B0017LCZEU I really enjoyed making my son's handprint and footprint from this kit. I'm glad it is something I can look at every Christmas.
B0017LCZEU very cute project. We did this with our one month old. It was very hard to do it with a one month old. came out okay. Had to give it a couple of tries. Dried well. Love the ribbons.
B0017LCZEU Our family loved getting these for Christmas!  They were pretty easy to make, although we didn't like the cutters that they provided because they left the edges really ragged.  We just formed our own little circles.  I would use them early on though because our 4-mo-old's feet were nearly too big for the ornament!
B0017LCZEU The kit itself was easy, getting my newborn to unclinch her fist to make the hand print not so much. The kit had everything I needed and I was actually able to make 4 placques!  My only reserve, was it seemed to crack a little bit when it dried.  It's not extremely noticeable, so I only took off one star.  It could have also been user error.  However, right after I bought and made this I saw a recipe for a handprint mold on pinterest with flour and water.  Might try that next time before I buy another kit.
B0017LCZEU I ordered this kit to make tree ornaments of my baby's hand and foot prints for her first Christmas.  They turned out so well!  I'm not sure why the instructions say to roll it out 3/4 inch thick though.  A half inch would be plenty to leave a print and would be less heavy.  My baby was about 10 months when we did these and was able to fit her hand in the circle provided.  I just rolled out the remaining piece free form for her foot.  There was no mess for the baby and they dried in a few days.
B0017LCZEU I don't recommend making 3 keepsakes out of one package but you can split in half and soften half at a time and it's a perfect amount.  I used everything provided in the package and they turned out great.  I made one of baby's hand and one of his foot.  Some of the reviewers were talking about putting a lot of pressure on baby's hand to make a good imprint but I found that to be untrue, i did not have to hurt a baby to make an imprint LOL.  Just make sure you soften it better and it's very soft.
