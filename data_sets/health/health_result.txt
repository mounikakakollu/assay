B0016NHN82 quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.
B0016NMIOG i like all the dishes or silverware come with cases to keep clean for my son. it is convient for travelling or go out.
B0017AE3BO We purchased this for our newborn and have used it for almost two years now. The dispenser is easy to access for an adult and holds a lot of soap, which means no frequent refills. The brush side was nice to use in her hair when she was little, though her hair is much too thick for it now. The sponge side works okay, but seemed as though it didn't dispense enough soap. You need to be careful how you store it when it is full or the soap will leak out-- there is a printed reminder on the brush that tells you what end is up. It was good for what we needed, but not really necessary.
B0017AE3BO Hands down, the gentlest but strongest brush around to prevent cradle cap.The bristles are thick but soft. The sponge part stinks though. You are better off just lathering the baby's head and then just using the bristle part. Sponge is too messy because you have to fill the body of the brush with shampoo to get it to work and it leaks everywhere if you do.
B0017AE3BO I love using this brush/sponge to shampoo my daughter's hair and her little hands and feet. If you rub the sponge too much it starts to peel off--we've already replaced ours once and my baby is only 6 months old. But, we bought it again because I couldn't find anything better, and now I know to be more gentle with it. Good, cheap buy!
B0017AE3BO It is very convenient.  The shampoo dispenser is awesome.  You fon't use a lot of shampoo, and the brush at the end is soft to wash my infant's hair.  The only inconvenience was the dispenser button.  It does not tell the amount of shampoo dispensed;  however, once you start using it, you will know.
B0017AE3BO I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great. I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )
B0017AE3BO I love this brush.  I love that it dispenses shampoo/body wash, I love the shape, I love that it is a sponge and a scrubber all in one.  However, they are not durable at all.  I've gone through 2 in 3 months (I bathe my son every 2 days).  I first thought that maybe I got a lemon, but the same thing happened to the second brush I ordered. The sponge is glued on and starts to slowly detach until the product becomes unusable.  I really wish they would figure out how to make it more durable because having it fall apart after 15-20 uses is unacceptable.
B0017AE3BO The brush I use in the bath, really just because I like to see her hair all brushed and her scalp stimulated, but it is useless otherwise. It is not good for skin, and the sponge side is not maneuverable enough to use in her crevases. I use a washcloth or my hands for most of her bathing. It would probably be more interesting if a baby has a lot of hair.
B0017LCZEU These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.
B0017LCZEU The clay is easy to use and roll out, but I did not think that they impressions came out too clearly. Overall a good bet due to the fact that they are easy to use and inexpensive, but you sacrifice detail due to the nature of the clay, which almost has a spongy quality to it.
B0017LCZEU the clay molds very well, and the circle cutter and straw work great to create a classy-looking ornament. 4 stars because the circle was too small for my (large) 4.5 month-old's foot! (says it's good for up to two years old) so now I have one really nice hand ornament and one messy looking foot ornament. Overall would buy again though.
B000P7FVX4 good quality... holding up good so far. will update later if anything happens. i want more of this but at a cheaper price. i'm glad i bought it when i did.
B000RYPZQ8 WONDERFUL TO USE WITH THE SUPPORT HANDLES ON EACH SIDE AND THE PADS KEEP MY KNEES FROM HEARTING AND EASY TO LIFT MYSELF UP.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking this for about 3 weeks now and have doubled up on the dosage.  I was experiencing a lot of bad eye strain effects, and at my age that's bothersome.  Watching way too many late movies and Netflix shows.  Plus a recent subscription to Crunchyroll had me watching more anime than usual.  My right eye has weakened more than my left and I think there is a problem when working both together with eye strain on the left.  It's hard to say because I cut back a bit on the TV, but I've not experienced any blurry vision in the last week, and that's even after a long session with reading anime subtitles.The formula itself seems to be well tolerated.  I take medication for thyroid, edema, and cholesterol, and I didn't notice any effect with any of the medications.  I did not notice any issues with any of my other supplements, although once I did get a slightly upset stomach.  I think it was more that I took this stuff without eating much.  I've been on a juicing diet for about 60 days and occasionally, it will give me some stomach trouble.  This usually goes away eating some steamed broccoli and carrots.  It went away like usual, so I can't blame the supplement.  This seems effective enough that I'll continue it and, maybe buy some if the effect lasts till the end of the bottle, I have about half left.  Recommended, but as with any supplement try and see if it has any effect and it may take a month or two to find out.  Stop immediately if it reacts to you or any medications you're on!
B0013OX9NC I've had my glasses since fourth grade, I'm 33 now, and every year my vision gets a little bit worse. My optometrist told me at some point I will have to take pressure drops daily for my eyes as they decline worse with each visit, and I dread getting glaucoma or going blind some day, it's one of my biggest fears as it's a realistic one and I simply love to read and write and watch movies and want to watch my kids grow up. I get twitches in my eyes sometimes and some of the meds I'm on make my vision blurry at times. Enter this supplement, I've been taking it daily and it's been helping a lot, counter acting the blurry vision from my side effects and also I haven't experienced any eye twitching lately, which is great and surprising to me as it's been happening for years. Highly recommended! I'm going to continue using these even after my sample vitamins are gone, hopefully they will keep my eyes healthy for years to come.
B0013OX9NC I am 55 years old & my eyesight is rapidly deteriorating, so much so That my Dr. recommended this supplement. It is recommended for good eye health by most ophthalmologists. This dosage was a better value that most name brands I've been researching so I figured I would give it a try, although the initial bottle was offered to me from Amazon Vine. I wanted to be sure I selected a brand that I could afford to continue with if it proved effective in a noticeable way.I think my ability to focus has improved a bit, enough so that I'm willing to give it a few more months of use before giving up. I am testing it by seeing what font size I can read without having to use my reading glasses & squint like crazy! I will update in  a few months.There were no negative side effects that I've noticed with this supplement. I take it with food & a large glass of fluids with lunch.
B0013OX9NC I have taken the entire bottle as directed and have found not even the slightest improvement in my vision. Of course, I do not feel that my vision has gotten worse. What is interesting is that a few days after I finished the bottle, I got a terrible headache (for 4 days).....I do not get headaches. I cannot remember when I last had a headache. I can only think that somehow, it was associated with stopping the supplement. Perhaps I should have slowed down when I was running out? I will not be taking these again....that headache was brutal. I now have even more empathy for migraine sufferers!
B0013OX9NC Supplements are a bit of a crap shoot. The designers make something that - on paper - would seem to be healthy for you, but can't guarantee any results. Results are a mystery, sometimes, because you can't exactly hook up your body to a diagnostic machine and say \"Yes, my __________ is operating with a 12% increase in efficiency,\" or \"It appears that my __________ has regenerated back 3% of the mass that I had lost.\" Unless there is some outward physical change or a noticeable boost to metabolism or energy level, the effects of a supplement are almost impossible to discern. Too, the effects of a supplement are not often immediately noticeable. Sometimes you need to take a supplement for an extended period of time before any changes in your body even come about. This product is a mystery to me. I've been taking it for about a month, now, and I can't say that it is doing anything, at all, to my body. As such, I can't really give it a positive rating. If I could tell it was actually doing something positive (or negative) I would be able to write a more informative review, but that just isn't possible at this point in time. If I notice anything different by the time I have consumed the entire bottle, I will come back and relate that. For now, two stars is the best I can give it.
B0013OX9XW Natto is a great source of vitamin K which improves circulation and promotes healing. As someone who rock climbs and gets minor injures fairly often, I find the ability of my blood to clot a priority. whether it's a placebo effect or not, I have noticed that cuts heal faster and it's easier to stop the blood after injuries.As with all vitamins, try it out, what do you have to lose? The possibility of a benefit that's proven to work for others (such as myself) is worth your personal investigation.
B0013OX9XW Shortly after I received this product I had an injury to my shoulder and my doctor and physiologist told me not to take this in case I needed surgery. They didn't want me to take anything with anti-coagulant properties. Fortunately I didn't need surgery, and completed my physical therapy about 3 weeks ago. At that time they cleared me to start taking the Jarrow NattoMax. I'm not sure if I'm seeing any improvements, but I wanted to try to see if it would help with my chronic pain. I also wanted to see if I had any adverse effects because I wanted my husband to take it for Dupuyene's Contracture - a build up of scar tissue that causes at least one finger to be drawn down toward the palm. I didn't have any adverse effects and he was anxious to give this a try, so I just ordered him his own bottle.I would recommend this to anyone who has a build up of scar tissue in the body - it's worth a try!
B0013OX9XW This is a product that has pharmacological effects.  Some folks use St Johns Wort to treat depression instead of taking prescription valium.  Nattomax affects blood clotting and some folks use it a non-prescribed substitute for Coumadin (warfarin).  A lot of people would argue against doing this self prescribing because of the potential for overdose and for unintended side-effects.  However, you cannot argue that it isn;t cheaper than going the prescription route.
B0013OX9XW This product is highly recommended for reducing the risk of blood clots and strokes, and has also bee recommended for alzheimer's patients to increase circulation to the brain.I can't vouch for those results as I have only taken this a short time, but the pills are easy to swallow and the scientific studies on this product are encouraging.I would caution against taking this with aspirin as Wiki says that one patient reported a cerebral hemorrhage with taking with this and aspirin, so do use this with caution under the guidance of a physician.
B0013OX9XW While I can't say definitively that NattoMax has helped to lower by blood pressure, it has gone down over the month I've been taking it. It was getting a little high and rather than use prescription drugs, I thought I'd try something a bit more natural. These capsules are easy to swallow and have no detrimental side effects that I've noted. If anything, it makes me feel more mel
B0013OX9XW My husband's blood pressure was running too high and he is against Western Medical treatment.  I saw this and thought it might be worth a try, and he accepted it without any problem.  (This is a man that won't take a Tylenol!)  They are just regular size clear filled gelcaps.  They don't taste like anything to me, and they didn't smell bad.  They are no problem to take.Neither of us had any GI side effects - no burps or unpleasant side effects.After 3-4 days, my husband noted that he was sleeping better -he said I don't hear my pulse in my ears anymore when I lay down.  He reported feeling better.It's about a month's supply, but the supplement itself is definitely a keeper.  His blood pressure started coming down after a week, and is now fairly close to the normal range- it does get a bit borderline but it's MUCH better.For me, I quit taking them because I got a bruise that I couldn't explain.  I don't think I need them though.  My husband, on the other hand, had no bruising problems at all.  Mine might have not been related, but I decided to err on the safe side.The Jarrow brand is very trustworthy to me, and I've never got a product from them that wasn't fresh and of better ingredients.
B0013OX9XW I tried this purely to see if it would help my feet warm up. Natto is claimed to help improve circulation, and I've had mildly chilly toes since I was a kid. I've noticed a little less of the cold feet effect on cold mornings, but not enough to where I can say that this stuff is definitely making a major difference. From the other reviews here and research I've done, this does work very well for some heart and blood pressure issues, and if it's getting folks off prescription drugs while providing the same or better benefits, while not adding the side-effects of most big pharma products, I'm all for it.But since I don't really have a major health issue that this would impact noticeably, I can only give these a neutral three stars. I'll keep taking them, but as it's already warm where I live, it's hard to say if my these are improving my circulation much.Sorry I can't be more helpful, but, honesty first.
B0013OX9XW Check with your doctor before you use natto.  Don't use it if you are on coumadin or warfarin, and be really careful and CHECK with your DOCTOR if you are on an aspirin regimen or if you are taking other medicines that can cause bleeding or if you have or have had an ulcer.Natto basically thins your blood.  It's great if, like me, you have some hyper coagulability (I do - it's one aspect of SLE for me), but it isn't something you want to take along with other blood thinners (including aspirin, gingko biloba, willow bark, and even vitamin e).If natto is something that is going to be safe for you, this is an excellent brand.  I take it when I need a break from my NSAIDs (every so often, I get bounce back headaches from daily use of aspirin, and I have to take a week off).  This keeps my labs stable while I do that.
B0013OX9XW I wanted to try NattoMax to see if it would help at all with my Superficial Thrombophlebitis.  I suffer from varicose veins in the legs with some superficial clotting under the skin on one of my feet. Yep, it is nasty to look at and nerve wracking just knowing I have it there, ready to implode at a moments notice.  YIKES!!So basically, since I am NOT on any Rx blood thinners at the moment, I was hoping that perhaps NattoMax would help to appreciably dissolve the visible clot.  So far , no luck after 2 weeks of one per day with food in the AM.  I can honestly report there have been no noticeable side effects of any kind, but also no actual results yet.  NO gastric problems or bad tastes either so the product, at least for me, seems benign.Perhaps the results I am seeking won't occur quite this quickly and I do plan on giving it a chance with a 60 day course of treatment. For now, 2 weeks have given me no noticeable results. (but no side effects either)  IF NattoMax ends up actually DOING something for my condition I will edit this review. (I am notorious for editing and adding to my reviews)****I am giving this product 3 stars (a Neutral rating) but may raise my rating if I notice any actual visible results from use.
B0013OXA5Y These are easy to swallow and have just the slightest herbal after taste.  They are good for your heart, and there doesn't seem to be any cons to taking these.  I can't say I see any instant results, as I don't have any heart issues.  However, it doesn't hurt to take these.  We could all use extra anti-oxidants in our diet.  I recommend it if you don't get enough of these nutrients daily.
B0013OXA5Y I wanted to give it a month before writing the review, I starting taking 2 pills a day after my meal, within a month my BP went from 155 to 132, and I feel much better. So we are clear, I was on BP meds and I basically tried them all I was having bad side effects. I decided to give this a try. I think is a miracle. Granted my BP sometimes spikes a little to 140, but it has been between 127 and 132 for the past week. I will keep using this and order some more.
B0013OXA8G After finding out I was low on serine and told to purchase this type, I have better cognitive and other brain functions.  Sometimes I do not remember to take it and I notice the difference...like now!
B0013OXA8G Serine is a bit harder to find in the diet.Definitely noticed calmer and more relaxed.  Not a great long term solution but feels good to take it.
B0013OXA8G I don't think I needed to use these, Im still young and felt like these were just b.s pills! I returned them! People swear they work from the testimonials I read online but its just not for me...
B0013OXA8G Three months ago, I started taking these (1-3 daily) in addition toNature's Way Alive Once Daily Women's Multi Ultra Potency, Tablets, 60-Count, fish oil and extra vitamin D. I'm ~3/4 through my first (and very challenging) year of medical school now, and I've managed to stay healthy while everyone around me is getting run-down and sick. The PS-100, this Jarrow product SPECIFICALLY (I've tried a few) is noticeably effective at helping sustain my academic endurance.
B0013OXA8G I used to take gel caps but when this arrived I was surprised to see they were capsules. I didn't read carefully. However, I also found out that this product has little or no taste so I put it in my smoothie in the morning and I can't taste it. Now I don't have to swallow all those gel caps.
B0013OXA8G I know a lot of people use this supplement daily, and that's fine - if you can afford it. I cannot afford to take 2 or 3 capsules a day everyday, so I will just take a short 5 day regimen of PS to optimize how long a bottle lasts.When I take PS, I notice that I wake in the morning and feel more refreshed. As a result, my head feels clearer and thoughts come more naturally. I'll always keep a bottle of this on the shelf, and take some when I feel like I need to have a good day the next morning.
B0013OXABS I'd like to write a good review for these vitamins, but the truth is I noticed an increase in headaches once I started taking them. Once I stopped, no more headaches!Something doesn't work for me in these vitamins, but your mileage may vary.
B0013OXABS For the most part, I've been happy with products I've tried from Jarrow. Lately I've been taking things that I don't even really need just to see if they help me out in any way. To be honest, I didn't even know what Ubiquinol was until I got my package in the mail. Energy isn't a problem of mine, though there are days when I'm not feeling all that lively, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before. I started taking a dose of Ubiquinol each day, and haven't noticed any side effects, or any real benefits for that matter aside from the fact that I haven't been having any of those \"down' days any more. This could be in part to me exercising more regularly than I was at the start of the year (I started taking Ubiquinol at the end of February), so I can't say for sure.As it is, the pills are easy to swallow with water, don't have any strange taste to them, and the fact that you're getting some good CoQ-10 in here, which aids blood flow and lets more oxygen get to your brain, and you've got a nice little supplement. Some people I know who've tried this stuff have mentioned that it makes them more alert and awake soon after taking it. Keep that in mind so you don't take a dose a little bit before bedtime or anything.
B0013OXABS First looking at one of these gel tablets is pretty daunting, as they are large and if taken without water can be hard to swallow.But whatever is in this tablet is effective.  If you need an energy boost this will provide one.  After a few trials of this product I've decided to take these only when needed because my body takes a while to burn off this excess, and staying up all night because I took one of these is not my idea of good rest.
B000BNSYHW I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLC.After a few coats of this stuff the neck looked/played/felt like it was just out of the factory! It restored years of neglect in just a few minutes.When I bought this I though it wouldn't be enough. BOY WAS I WRONG. I'll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come."
B000BNSYHW Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good."
B000BQTCDO It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product."
B000BYPJ1U It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water."
B000CCJP4I the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
B000CD1R7K Was using a box and this is a great help.  My stomach doesn't feel wrenched anymore.  I use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg.  Maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me."
B000CD1R7K I like this product, but wish it had a wider foot or base to it for carpeted areas, it does get a little unstable on carpet.  Does fine on hard floors."
B000E0PPG0 Okay here we go again what can be said about this roduct except that it works and does what it us supposed to"
B000EEHJS8 I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time.I've used Carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove.There were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface. They were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them. Not a sufficient defect to return the instrument.Another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal. I have open tuning machines, and before applying Tri-Flow with a pinpoint applicator, I used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel. The chrome is gleaming. They're really beautiful. Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed. Also got the tuning pegs. This is a 000 - OM acoustic. Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (I used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me."
B000EEHJS8 This stuff works amazingly. If your interested in buying the product, don't listen to the people who say it is too dry. I thought it worked good, and mine was a bit dry. This stuff isn't supposed to be really waxy, its a hard wax so I would think it was supposed to be cracked. Mine wasn't that cracked, and it worked great! I love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a must-have."
B000EEJ8IM Make sure you order the right size! I don't use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings."
B000EEJAWQ A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak."
B000EEJF4O I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. I used this, and the color became rich and less dry. If your fret board is pretty dry, DO NOT remove the oil. Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. I love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. I didn't even notice a smell. I definitely would say this is a must-have."
B000EEJF4O I requested this for Christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it. I've used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great. First I used it to treat clean fingerboards that were in good shape and it worked well. It can even make a big improvement to the dry, porous surface of a cheap fretboard, and good rosewood fingerboards love the stuff.Later on I got some used guitars and used cleaned the gunky fingerboards with Guitar Honey (apply it, scrub with toothbrush, wipe with paper towel, repeat) and it did a lot better than I expected at removing the yucky buildup next to the frets.I like to apply it fairly heavily and lay the guitar down with the fingerboard level and facing up, and give it time to soak in. You will notice that some areas soak it more than others. I move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly. Then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and you're ready to go.When I wipe down the strings after playing the first time or two after treating with Guitar Honey, the rag shows dark lines where the Guitar Honey cleaned the strings. I like making my strings last longer!Get some. I don't think you'll regret it."
B000EEJF4O This stuff is great. Leaves board clean and fast. No residue, no sticky and no oil film. Price is right. If you use any fingerboard treatment, try this one..."

B0016NHN82 quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.
B0016NMIOG i like all the dishes or silverware come with cases to keep clean for my son. it is convient for travelling or go out.
B0017AE3BO We purchased this for our newborn and have used it for almost two years now. The dispenser is easy to access for an adult and holds a lot of soap, which means no frequent refills. The brush side was nice to use in her hair when she was little, though her hair is much too thick for it now. The sponge side works okay, but seemed as though it didn't dispense enough soap. You need to be careful how you store it when it is full or the soap will leak out-- there is a printed reminder on the brush that tells you what end is up. It was good for what we needed, but not really necessary.
B0017AE3BO Hands down, the gentlest but strongest brush around to prevent cradle cap.The bristles are thick but soft. The sponge part stinks though. You are better off just lathering the baby's head and then just using the bristle part. Sponge is too messy because you have to fill the body of the brush with shampoo to get it to work and it leaks everywhere if you do.
B0017AE3BO I love using this brush/sponge to shampoo my daughter's hair and her little hands and feet. If you rub the sponge too much it starts to peel off--we've already replaced ours once and my baby is only 6 months old. But, we bought it again because I couldn't find anything better, and now I know to be more gentle with it. Good, cheap buy!
B0017AE3BO It is very convenient.  The shampoo dispenser is awesome.  You fon't use a lot of shampoo, and the brush at the end is soft to wash my infant's hair.  The only inconvenience was the dispenser button.  It does not tell the amount of shampoo dispensed;  however, once you start using it, you will know.
B0017AE3BO I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great. I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )
B0017AE3BO I love this brush.  I love that it dispenses shampoo/body wash, I love the shape, I love that it is a sponge and a scrubber all in one.  However, they are not durable at all.  I've gone through 2 in 3 months (I bathe my son every 2 days).  I first thought that maybe I got a lemon, but the same thing happened to the second brush I ordered. The sponge is glued on and starts to slowly detach until the product becomes unusable.  I really wish they would figure out how to make it more durable because having it fall apart after 15-20 uses is unacceptable.
B0017AE3BO The brush I use in the bath, really just because I like to see her hair all brushed and her scalp stimulated, but it is useless otherwise. It is not good for skin, and the sponge side is not maneuverable enough to use in her crevases. I use a washcloth or my hands for most of her bathing. It would probably be more interesting if a baby has a lot of hair.
B0017LCZEU These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.
B0017LCZEU The clay is easy to use and roll out, but I did not think that they impressions came out too clearly. Overall a good bet due to the fact that they are easy to use and inexpensive, but you sacrifice detail due to the nature of the clay, which almost has a spongy quality to it.
B0017LCZEU the clay molds very well, and the circle cutter and straw work great to create a classy-looking ornament. 4 stars because the circle was too small for my (large) 4.5 month-old's foot! (says it's good for up to two years old) so now I have one really nice hand ornament and one messy looking foot ornament. Overall would buy again though.
